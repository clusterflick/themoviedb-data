She leads a wonderfully full life, and - for the most part - wouldn't change a thing. Her other half and platonic life partner is Jake. They share an uncommonly close bond. Suddenly though, Sonali is left to examine her place in the world when Jake introduces a new, serious boyfriend. Sensing a fundamental shift, she spins out in a moment of doubt, even as she takes bold, decisive steps towards making a family in her own unorthodox way. In a world (even a gay one) that elevates traditional, heteronormative romantic relationships to be unquestionably the most important ones, is there a space for her? Where does she fit?","popularity":0.2535,"poster_path":"/1IoEnXQYPfLOMq68Hv9q7BBk7k5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Albatross Cafe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":211944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonal Shah","original_name":"Sonal Shah","popularity":0.2686,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"640bde5da6c10400c0c37c74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Doyle","original_name":"Matt Doyle","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/xBpWonguE4Ml4QvsZH1sayriXl0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"640bde7ae18e3f00b86c1507","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Dallam","original_name":"Jordan Dallam","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"640bde8be18e3f00993fa0d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Weiss","original_name":"Matt Weiss","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"640bde8fb4224200b9715551","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Grayson Stephens","original_name":"Andrew Grayson Stephens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bde462a09bc00c52cc575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amrita Vijayaraghavan","original_name":"Amrita Vijayaraghavan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bde4eb4224200b9715526","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26537238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1IoEnXQYPfLOMq68Hv9q7BBk7k5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
