Sani is an orphan who is raised by his grandmother in the village. His parents died when he was little. His teachers think that he can develop further if he goes to Jakarta to study. Reluctantly, Sani agrees. So in Jakarta, he stays with the younger sibling of his teacher, but he faces problems. The most intriguing part is his wish to have a harmonica, a new instrument that he has never seen before.","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116169,"logo_path":null,"name":"PPFN","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1979-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Harmonica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1659190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fachrul Rozy","original_name":"Fachrul Rozy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sani","credit_id":"640b23ea18b75100e8c1f2ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.D.
