A large number of patients suffered serious consequences, and the LSD doctors were accused of subjecting patients to experimentation, coercion and lethal treatments with LSD, but were acquitted of all charges. But now, 60 years later, a secret archive of LSD doctors has emerged, casting doubt on the authorities’ decision in one of the most bizarre drug scandals in Danish history. Journalist Lotte Mathilde Nielsen is the director, and actor Thure Lindhardt has directed the dramatisation, using all his cinematic experience with dramatic reconstructions and star actors like Søren Pilmark and Amalie Dollerup in the roles of the LSD doctors.","popularity":0.2395,"poster_path":"/iVgu9WXYiHRanCW1Ux2MsU5nRUv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2023-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A drama documentary tells the story of one of the biggest psychiatric scandals in Danish history.","title":"The Insane Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Einar Geert-Jørgensen","original_name":"Einar Geert-Jørgensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"640c438a2a09bc00f72c70f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Søren Pilmark","original_name":"Søren Pilmark","popularity":0.4101,"profile_path":"/u1J6ERVpf0FqV6AtbrDiIeGsum7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chief Physician Einar Geert-Jørgensen","credit_id":"640c43a4b4224200b97184d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amalie Dollerup","original_name":"Amalie Dollerup","popularity":0.1567,"profile_path":"/rWOB5tW3s2Hxn7ETxMVfVE3jZNc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Ketty Kjærbye","credit_id":"640c43ba1ac29200cd9504d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2532340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Haugaard","original_name":"Magnus Haugaard","popularity":0.139,"profile_path":"/fKxaRjgXgSVvfPtZPmLiYUYqKRv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Psychiatric patient","credit_id":"640c45742a09bc00e84438a5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thure Lindhardt","original_name":"Thure Lindhardt","popularity":0.9862,"profile_path":"/lDkRe6dlQoiehjay8pEP2WLU4qG.jpg","credit_id":"640c43e02a09bc00f72c7119","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Mathilde Nielsen","original_name":"Lotte Mathilde Nielsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c43d01ac292007c349ef4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958668,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Berthel Ravn Berthelsen","original_name":"Berthel Ravn Berthelsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c443a323eba00844911dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/meCAVsdAnCpHSAAfhrTu66GCsMc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1179,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/iVgu9WXYiHRanCW1Ux2MsU5nRUv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzUtwEJfS7TDu1QTiLD85yDMULs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"World premiere at CPH: DOX 2023 (first 2 episodes of an 8-part series airing on TV2 later this year)","release_date":"2023-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
