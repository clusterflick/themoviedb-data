TAIS commissioned six Canadian artists – Alex McLeod, Amy Lockhart, Barry Doupé, Daniel Barrow, Lorna Mills & Mark Pellegrino – to create animations by exploring Amiga computers. These machines were popularized for graphics and image generation in the 1980s and early 1990s. The artists have created captivating works that promote necessary critical discourse around animation, ponder the history of recent technologies and embrace new manipulations of old processes.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello Amiga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3926766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Barrow","original_name":"Daniel Barrow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bd781439be1007a8a6e57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Doupé","original_name":"Barry Doupé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nN53QId1b8ggiM9jUaOYd6AD06c.jpg","credit_id":"640bd796b4224200826cd6a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Lockhart","original_name":"Amy Lockhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/unZDaV1DcsRNoQPtdA9dttwypKH.jpg","credit_id":"640bd7b9fba625010aa9b914","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3508041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex McLeod","original_name":"Alex McLeod","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bd8ce323eba010b8fc4b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorna Mills","original_name":"Lorna Mills","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bd8e9e18e3f007c1fa428","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Pellegrino","original_name":"Mark Pellegrino","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bd90d439be10080047e9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
