I have taken buildings of the most well known architectural projects from the Beijing skyscape and reconstructed them so they become an undoable spectacle. The Chinese Government is deliberately producing awe-inspiring architecture to persuade and convince foreign observers of their hyper-modernist perspective. More importantly, while visiting Beijing it became evident that the Communist Party is also deliberately using architecture to persuade and convince their national audience of the Partyâ€™s insightful perspective on their own future.","popularity":0.0243,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Minutes in Beijing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Kelly","original_name":"Kevin Kelly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bd307b42242007d6fbc85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
