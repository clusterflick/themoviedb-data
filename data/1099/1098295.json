This evocative documentary is also a deep dive into the eye-opening story of Harry Odell, the theatre’s founder and Hong Kong’s first impresario, who brought Xavier Cugat, Isaac Stern, and other legendary musical figures to the city. Rich with local history, and possessing a surprising connection to local singer Hins Cheung, the story of the State Theatre and Harry Odell is a celebration of Hong Kong’s dynamic culture and indomitable spirit.","popularity":0.1099,"poster_path":"/hQQWxPbAShJ6792cFJva6HiFcjA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Be Continued","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3957175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dora Choi","original_name":"Dora Choi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cdsEjxrSWM7cSXIA3HIkkoV1oUf.jpg","credit_id":"640aeb233a4a1200ee5405c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3957174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haider Kikabhoy","original_name":"Haider Kikabhoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4ojMOvMl7CzBPynvulNodCie2tn.jpg","credit_id":"640aeb1918b75100c5230e08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"docu.tobecontinued","instagram_id":"docu_to.be.continued","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/hQQWxPbAShJ6792cFJva6HiFcjA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1462},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r1Q3l6XSJm06LoxVIzvHqOncQ1U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1120,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/xAZSNDY1MYrrYeQuaVIxhjUWdpK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1132,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/1mmBzkba5CHqFdIp1Kd9pg0pxjB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":793,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/ywAniRoBKSfg4bHi728jX9hUN8m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
