This animation, made up of hundreds of high-resolution photographs, unabashedly examines the evidence of physical change and transformation: top surgery scars, tattoos, and other traces. The bodies are fragmented, as are the stories affiliated with these traces, and identities remain delightfully elusive. “Borders” is available as a single-channel work or as an extended installation.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Gelis","original_name":"Alexandra Gelis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640bddbde18e3f00de559f52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
