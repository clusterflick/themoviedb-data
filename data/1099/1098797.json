In fact, he was financially screwed and got no goodbyes or thank yous on the way out. Retirement is a huge change in one’s life, identity and self-perception – and these are exactly the three things Randløv sets out to explore. From a warm, anthropological angle, she talks to a large cast of ordinary people about their experience of the transition to a retired life. And if there’s one thing everyone agrees on, it’s that recognition outweighs cold hard cash. And when recognition costs no one anything, why should it really be so hard to pass on?","popularity":0.0791,"poster_path":"/518mkAApl7qo48wxrYE0WSVgBxh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118,"logo_path":"/AiBorgNTCS1lT1FdFPYheax9jfF.png","name":"Det Danske Filminstitut","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":195574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Konsulentordningen for Dokumentarfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2023-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A heartwarming and vibrant film about a chapter in life that everyone will have to deal with sooner or later: The transition from working life to retirement.","title":"Thanks for Your Service","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Thanks for your service","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427139,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kaspar Kaae","original_name":"Kaspar Kaae","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c3492b42242008a2cc19c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958612,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie Schmidt Olesen","original_name":"Marie Schmidt Olesen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c34181ac292007c349832","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peder Frederik Jensen","original_name":"Peder Frederik Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c34d31ac29200cd94fea5","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Production"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2681418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carina Randløv","original_name":"Carina Randløv","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c3404323eba00ef6105aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2955161,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathias Døcker","original_name":"Mathias Døcker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c343ca6c1040082512253","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958616,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mamoun Abufarha","original_name":"Mamoun Abufarha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c34af2a09bc00e844315d","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302752,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anne Gry Friis Kristensen","original_name":"Anne Gry Friis Kristensen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c3453e18e3f07d05392ed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230421,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sofie Steenberger","original_name":"Sofie Steenberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/uVfHM0CwqZk9qYlWo6cUTN1s0lF.jpg","credit_id":"640c3469323eba007cb6800c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/518mkAApl7qo48wxrYE0WSVgBxh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"World Premiere at CPH: DOX 2023","release_date":"2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
