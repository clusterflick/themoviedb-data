In a world where women have no legal rights, his play examines a woman who, coming from nothing, has become one of the most wealthy and powerful of executives running an international string of high-class brothels, keeping her life hidden from her daughter. Only when the truth is revealed does the house of cards topple.  In this infamous comedy/drama, George Bernard Shaw brings us his most provocative play, which examines how six people face their past to plan for their future, including the mysterious title character who has built a global empire from the ground up.  Come experience the provocative play that, in its world debut in New York in 1905, the entire cast was arrested on opening night! With a glorious cast by the most amusing and insightful playwright in the English language, the always rascally George Bernard Shaw.","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":"/hxRCZ7A3ENDsimNcCDKdHSX6CeX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gingold Theatrical
