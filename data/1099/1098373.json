A former member, who fears retaliation from the group, gives a statement, as does Vogel, who discusses the organization's objectives. One of the leaders explains why their website contains bomb-making instructions and why it includes search keywords commonly used by children. According to them, once the bomb is made, the creator will use it to blow up their own family members, creating chaos. They believe that families must be destroyed in order to achieve individual freedom. Another member promotes LSD as the source of happiness, with the goal of distributing synthetic LSD through the water supply. They claim that laboratories will soon be established where chemists and doctors will manufacture the substance, arguing that as many people as possible need to be awakened. Well, the filmmakers are also contributing to this effort.","popularity":0.1152,"poster_path":"/yMk1ToiHhEc4ZKUKcrUaDQtzoIe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2001-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The brat Puzsér's controversial documentary from 2001","title":"CHMTX-riport","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2592745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Róbert Puzsér","original_name":"Puzsér Róbert","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/p05d6iXPMLKNkSb5voTk0TBZAQC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Editor/Reporter","credit_id":"640b3b2f18b75100842855fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2592745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Róbert Puzsér","original_name":"Puzsér Róbert","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/p05d6iXPMLKNkSb5voTk0TBZAQC.jpg","credit_id":"640b3ab218b75100a26a2815","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957396,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dinnyés Márton","original_name":"Dinnyés Márton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640b3add9dee58007ce2fd49","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957398,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Götz Attila","original_name":"Götz Attila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640b3af23a4a1200b6eac853","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957400,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helvei Tamás","original_name":"Helvei Tamás","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640b3b069dee5800b8757389","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2592745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Róbert Puzsér","original_name":"Puzsér Róbert","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/p05d6iXPMLKNkSb5voTk0TBZAQC.jpg","credit_id":"67a0c569776edf4be3954e41","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2592745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Róbert Puzsér","original_name":"Puzsér Róbert","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/p05d6iXPMLKNkSb5voTk0TBZAQC.jpg","credit_id":"67a0c5781742b44a14cb8d48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8jvL6kfYIXrsOgTdik7Mg5djzy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yMk1ToiHhEc4ZKUKcrUaDQtzoIe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160517,"name":"fake documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
