Thornton would perish while attempting to parachute carrying African gold coins, weapons, thousands in cash and 75 pounds of cocaine. From the CIA to secret parties, Thornton is described as the James Bond of Kentucky by those who knew him.  The documentary uncovers the true story behind the drug-sniffing bear and its rise to stardom. The film dissects the myths surrounding the ultimate party animal. Did Country Music legend Waylon Jennings buy the taxidermied bear? How much cocaine did it eat? And is the actual drug-eating bear now on display in a Kentucky store?","popularity":0.9183,"poster_path":"/4CeOT7cqGW5as95vqSE2e6LRZi1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163826,"logo_path":null,"name":"WAVE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sniffing out Fact from Fiction","title":"Blow: The True Story of Cocaine, a Bear, and a Crooked Kentucky Cop","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3956801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kris Ellison Baete","original_name":"Kris Ellison Baete","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640a82eb3a4a12007c22c903","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3956803,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalia Martinez","original_name":"Natalia Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640a833741a561007a55c6b5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3956804,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonny Trego","original_name":"Jonny Trego","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640a834ecaaca2008f0a5f76","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3956806,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Scott Isaacs","original_name":"Scott Isaacs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640a83729dee5800dee04715","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27077972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fuJCj6xmWntZ2XYk22lJAnsWrW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6W4dfleyMEitznr56pJwwh0kcOZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1306,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqJl7DLMBHtshcT2ZoDm1MGZsoK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":870},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1306,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4CeOT7cqGW5as95vqSE2e6LRZi1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":870}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3800,"name":"airplane"},{"id":2150,"name":"cocaine"},{"id":3291,"name":"kentucky"},{"id":8015,"name":"cop"},{"id":10468,"name":"bear"},{"id":272472,"name":"bears"},{"id":314470,"name":"cocaine cows"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
