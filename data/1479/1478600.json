In this cabin, he placed three chairs: one chair for solitude, one chair for friendship, and one chair for society. Now, 180 years later, we enter his home to stay for a while and build a shadow-forest to place three tables. Thoreau left behind his writings and drawings, observing carefully the life of diverse animals and plants in the woods. The traces he left are reimagined as a performance interwoven with various other stories and shifting shadows between light and darkness.  “We may no longer know how to make fire, how to pray, or where the forest to pray in is”, but on the ruins already burned, we begin to rebuild a landscape of  \"a home as forest\" and \"a forest as home.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s3Bo4rnerxQmz4L8e7QwSOGlZXo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2025-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow-Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Go-Eun Im","original_name":"Go-Eun Im","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681ec394c94058087d4b397c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1380,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s3Bo4rnerxQmz4L8e7QwSOGlZXo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"MMCA Seoul","release_date":"2025-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
