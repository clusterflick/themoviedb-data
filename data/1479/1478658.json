What this world is about and what all these people are about. You will see a long road that lasted a month and a half. Which was difficult and sometimes unbearable. A million sounds and phenomena that we come across from time to time, but maybe we don't see the connection between them. A film that finds itself. A story that tries to be separate, but life puts its points. A depiction of a reality that is always around us, but do we know it?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dolphin Who Lives His Life And Eats Cakes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
