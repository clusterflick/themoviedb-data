They climb, ride and explore the ambitious peaks. Its full immersion. Full connection. And full removal from the city clique. Set in the wilds of Alaska, Sugar Mountain brings a fresh style and a unique outlook to the adventure documentary genre by replacing helicopters with bleeding edge drone technology, and cosmic animation. The film, directed by Richard James of the acclaimed White Silk Road on snowboarding in Afghanistan, is produced by Oscar McLennan and filmed with bleeding edge drone tech by 3D Robotics. It stars world class skiers Chris Booth, Watkin McLennan, Tim Myers and Miles Clark. Sugar Mountain flaunts an original score by Geordie Miller, and artwork by the prolific Celeste Byers of California.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sugar Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4119026","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
