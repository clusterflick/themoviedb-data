At its heart is Catherine, a decorated soldier and mother who returns from deployment profoundly changed—emotionally withdrawn, plagued by guilt, and struggling with addiction. Her daughter, Hope, once protected by her mother's strength, becomes a witness to her unraveling, forced to mature too quickly amid the chaos of relocation, strained family bonds, and a lack of institutional support. As Catherine battles to reintegrate, her marriage collapses, and the military’s absence of post-deployment care deepens her isolation. Her husband leaves, her daughter grows distant, and Catherine is left with the crushing realization that service came at a cost no one prepared her for.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/bnevnKsV8H4k1ln5oh1MBKpaq84.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""},{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"After returning from combat, a soldier’s struggle with trauma, addiction, and fractured family ties forces her daughter to confront the quiet war unfolding at home—one that neither of them signed up for but both must survive.","title":"Hope: In the Aftermath of War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5429797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Harris","original_name":"Catherine Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Catherine Harris","credit_id":"681f9cb4d076d134a5c84bfd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5429800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taryn Hope Harris","original_name":"Taryn Hope Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Taryn Hope Harris","credit_id":"681f9cc58a0d663e9f7388c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5429801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Harris","original_name":"Will Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Will Harris","credit_id":"681f9cd46e5bb4e1304b3d00","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
