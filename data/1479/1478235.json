A time outside time, magic is everywhere and anything is possible. Bearing witness to this turning point, the inhabitants gather for a wassail - a centuries old thanksgiving ritual in which folk gather to honour the slow return of the sun and bless the apple trees whose fruit are essential to the village ecosystem, not least the crumbles, juice and cider that sustains them throughout the year.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/44gyXDPwjS0rXrbxH0PhHiRPWfz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":261829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild
