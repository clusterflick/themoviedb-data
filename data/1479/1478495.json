Pasajuego is the name of the court in which the game is played. Pelota mixteca originated in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The games between Oaxacan communities have grown into international tournaments that are played throughout California, Texas, and Mexico. The sport not only serves as their pastime; it helps keep the Oaxacan culture alive and acts as a network for the immigrant community throughout the West Coast. Pasajuego is an introduction to their ancient game and a window into the lives of Oaxacan communities and culture.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eJmsrp1ta0T8JFpi2iNxcityOef.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197478,"logo_path":null,"name":"EPF Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Oaxacan indigenous game of pelota mixteca","title":"Pasajuego","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Oliveras de Ita","original_name":"Daniel Oliveras de Ita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6c7eb7128225c98c70e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428232,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pasatono Orquesta","original_name":"Pasatono Orquesta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6ca0fcf13840da9c2c3a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428233,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"La Banda del Sur","original_name":"La Banda del Sur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6cbbe2b2394cc29c2c52","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428234,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alvaro Monterrubio","original_name":"Alvaro Monterrubio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6cc96596de658d351eec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428235,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alejandro Cons","original_name":"Alejandro Cons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6cdfcf90666dd0bbe53b","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428237,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emiliano Lopez Carlton","original_name":"Emiliano Lopez Carlton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6d07be100c8876351ea4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edwina Lantigua","original_name":"Edwina Lantigua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6d185467013de3bbe3b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edwina Lantigua","original_name":"Edwina Lantigua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e6d2eaf412e555e9c2c84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14129920","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":905,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJmsrp1ta0T8JFpi2iNxcityOef.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":603}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":161643,"name":"sport competition"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":351696,"name":"mexican sport"},{"id":351697,"name":"pelota mixteca"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RAI Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Latin American Studies Film Festival","release_date":"2019-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
