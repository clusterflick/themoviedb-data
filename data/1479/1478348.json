Soon, they're hunted by a swarm of mutated, flesh-eating otters infected by toxic waste from a nearby chemical spill. As the blood-soaked chaos unfolds, friendships fracture and survival instincts kick in. With no way to call for help, the group must fight back using whatever weapons they can find—including a chainsaw and a whole lot of rage. But just when they think it's over, the infection reveals it may have already claimed one of their own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2A5jqGymhdy1bSgZ62MlCsO9ofj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carnivotter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3037274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Graves","original_name":"Josh Graves","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/wYnEjtLzTvQ4vxA5NnRGplHZ9j4.jpg","credit_id":"681e1e9c8783b3db17c1e341","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":834,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2A5jqGymhdy1bSgZ62MlCsO9ofj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
