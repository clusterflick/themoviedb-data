Filmmaker Roger Gual brought together sixteen people with no filmmaking experience with the challenge of creating a film in one month. No script, no locations, no open casting, and no money. With these elements, David Lillo wrote in one week the story of Pedro, a company manager who decides to leave his top-floor office to work as a parking attendant in the basement. The second week was dedicated to pre-production, location scouting, and rehearsals. The filming ultimately took place in seven days and one night. The result is 'Parking': magic and cinema.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2007-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Cánovas","original_name":"Pedro Cánovas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1e89f61be2d8c693b3e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Ángel Rábade","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Rábade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1e97853bc5cfe088c869","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domingo Fernández","original_name":"Domingo Fernández","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1ea80cabf8b46f3ece10","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5361679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Melgar","original_name":"Virginia Melgar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1eb4ed5c69db3f88c923","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cinta Ortega","original_name":"Cinta Ortega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1ec025e95536e5c1e1a3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelo Rábade","original_name":"Chelo Rábade","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1ecb6c7881d1c40b305b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Polonio","original_name":"Rosa Polonio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1ed6740cf97b1dc1e272","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Isidro Muñoz","original_name":"Isidro Muñoz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1ee324375906403ece0b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Hamfler","original_name":"Christian Hamfler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1ef1fabf6d4bec01f067","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3158404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"José Ignacio García","original_name":"José Ignacio García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"681e1efe1824b28b6a93b7d4","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lillo","original_name":"David Lillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e1e25d1f4d5422c93b538","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5427605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lillo","original_name":"David Lillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681e1f1beee63ef7580b2fc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1058740","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Digital Barcelona Film Festival","release_date":"2007-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
