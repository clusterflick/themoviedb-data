This major work of postwar activist independent film deploys a radical visual style that shuttles between X-rays and Osaka’s rough urban map, seeking out visualizations of a many-layered trauma that is physical and social and inscribed into the city’s transit structure. The film is one of the central works of Ko Hiroh (1938-2024), a filmmaker who left his mark on major turning points in Japanese cinema but is almost unknown outside of Japan.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Document of Collision: The Whiplashed Ones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5429328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroh Ko","original_name":"Hiroh Ko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681f51e1555633850ead89a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
