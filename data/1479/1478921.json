The film emphasizes the penetration of montage, with an anarchic and chaotic tone that reflects both fun and disorder.  The film brings to life concerns about how a woman moves, how she speaks, dreams, and how she is stripped of her inherent qualities by a society which continues to sexualize and harmfully perceive her. It visualizes a recollection of thoughts, dreams and memories, symbolically intertwining the characters experiences of their conscious with their subconscious.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
