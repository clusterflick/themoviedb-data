Although Gustavo remains in her heart, Diana decides to marry David; however, shortly before the wedding, she breaks off the engagement to honor his feelings. However, her greatest fear materializes: she becomes pregnant with David's child, and her dreams of success are now at risk.  Diana must decide between forming a single-parent family in a now more open society, without the prejudices and accusations her mother, Juana Crespo, endured when she decided to become a single mother, or succumb to Gustavo's insistence and trust that the love he professes for her is true.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Hija De Juana Crespo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcos Moreno","original_name":"Marcos Moreno","popularity":0.3425,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"681fcbcd1ec97632f0c84d60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iván Tamayo","original_name":"Iván Tamayo","popularity":0.447,"profile_path":"/ee7mOOVAoYWalepFYwXus7kuR9e.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"681fcbd90f32b64995ad8baa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliet Lima","original_name":"Juliet Lima","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"681fcbe68902577dfe5a23f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariela Alcala","original_name":"Mariela Alcala","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"681fcbf7343fb57fd7ad8b5d","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
