The destroyed forest becomes an artistic topos, a symbol of an environmental catastrophe caused by climate change. Through advanced digital editing techniques – masking, selective color extraction, time-based color changes, and compositing – the film mirrors the degradation of nature in the transformation of the film frames themselves. The dying forest becomes an emblem not only of ecological destruction but also of an urgent artistic vision.
