Homeschooled from an early age, Hayden found community and inspiration in avant-garde music and art online as a teenager. Influenced by figures like performance artist Chris Burden, guitarist John Fahey, and director Harmony Korine, Hayden’s persona often blurs the lines between reality and performance.  In his directorial debut, photographer Bob Foster channels his fascination with Americana, people and place, combining Bruna Manfredi’s sensitive editing with an atmospheric soundtrack of Hayden's music to capture a journey of artistry and identity, shaped by the landscapes of the Texas Panhandle.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/trfq9jbxEByeK1Wa2sI0B1RWHk8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High Lonesome Plains: A Hayden Pedigo Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3308402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayden Pedigo","original_name":"Hayden Pedigo","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6872418c3f0f248c45c5b61f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728662,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bob Foster","original_name":"Bob Foster","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687242332150c1dcde6ea0f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruna Manfredi","original_name":"Bruna Manfredi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68724255f42b429bf0c0917f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5559525,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Passey","original_name":"David Passey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6872427bce4b63e069541ef3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3417935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Clarke","original_name":"Jamie Clarke","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687242cc51958606c9541eaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5559527,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"L'Hannah Pedigo","original_name":"L'Hannah Pedigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687242fa65e69f4515ba32c0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5559529,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bob Foster","original_name":"Bob Foster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68724312fc7d856bb6a9822f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2997,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/trfq9jbxEByeK1Wa2sI0B1RWHk8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
