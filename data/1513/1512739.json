Ivan Dorn, who co-wrote and soundtracked the film, also stars as the bus driver. He leads the journey across state lines, while contending with border controls, as the passengers find solace and strength in music, shared stories, and each other. The film juxtaposes surrealist elements with a visceral portrayal of the loneliness and fear of being stateless.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shelter","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foreign
