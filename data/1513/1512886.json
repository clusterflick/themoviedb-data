The trip starts on board the ferry Finlandia. On the way, the travel photographer and his travel companions pass Lahti, Mikkeli and Savonlinna, where he films sights such as Olavinlinna (Olofsborg) and the Kerimaki Church. Along the way, they stay overnight at campsites and both sail and swim in the many lakes and rivers. The landscape is characterized by forest and water. The trip also passes Helsinki and the various sights that the capital offers: the iconic station building, the market square, open-air theater and folk dancing in Finnish folk costumes. In addition, there are also recordings from, among other places, the Temple Square Church and the statue of Johan Ludvig Runeberg, who is considered Finland's national poet.
