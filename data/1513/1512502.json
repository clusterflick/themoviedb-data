The show was part of a UK run celebrating the 40th anniversary of Fleetwood Mac’s iconic Rumours album, with a setlist focused entirely on tracks from that record. The group performed the full Rumours tracklist in sequence—starting with “Second Hand News” and concluding with “Songbird” and “Tusk” as encores—following the precise running order of the original album. The ensemble aimed for fidelity to the original arrangements, delivering tight vocal harmonies and instrumental recreations. Filmed in May 2018, the concert offers a complete live rendition of Rumours in a single, uninterrupted set, capturing the album as a standalone live experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oGQ1UkEjUgHBlQMs7UYGN4or7QD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rumours of Fleetwood Mac - Live at The Sage","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8gEn6BBvD9OBj29yHocbAeSaRDH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGQ1UkEjUgHBlQMs7UYGN4or7QD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
