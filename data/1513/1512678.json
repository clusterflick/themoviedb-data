I was going through a period of pain and great change. I saw others perceiving her existence so differently than I did. At this point, I began to ask myself many questions about the origins of my sadness.  Seeing her work, \"Superheroes Without Superpowers,\" struck me. I delved deeper with \"The Den\" and from there, I reached the point of no return. That evening in early July three years ago, I realized that the emotion I felt, and that I wanted to protect at all costs, was my own sadness. A sadness I kept finding in others and that had consumed me, to the point of making me lose who I was.  I denied Ginevra's existence for years. I wanted only Axel to assert himself. I didn't make this short film to seek answers, but to put together the pieces of my life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Un neo adulto interrogandosi sulla percezione dei ricordi distorti della sua infanzia, capisce che il modo in cui li rivive Ã¨ stato influenzato da qualcosa di potente.","title":"Ginevra - take my hand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5176314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel Quaranta","original_name":"Axel Quaranta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Child 1","credit_id":"6873c4da2150c1dcde6ea876","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domenico Quaranta","original_name":"Domenico Quaranta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6873c4fe6ce9d985b0ed7fbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Bernardini","original_name":"Monica Bernardini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6873c52a48bea9d2d0542817","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Quaranta","original_name":"Sofia Quaranta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sister","credit_id":"6873c53a2fb232274dc0981c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filomena Scavina","original_name":"Filomena Scavina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Grandmother 2","credit_id":"6873c55ec74a5042c8105ebc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Quaranta","original_name":"Francesco Quaranta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Grandfather 1","credit_id":"6873c5731e2d400fe0705620","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Concetta Pezone","original_name":"Maria Concetta Pezone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Grandmother 1","credit_id":"6873c594af6b528508ed8297","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Schwarz","original_name":"Alessandro Schwarz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cousin 1","credit_id":"6873c5bc77c0fd3edcc09799","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Schwarz","original_name":"Francesco Schwarz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Cousin 2","credit_id":"6873c5d16ce9d985b0ed7fc9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giancarlo Bernardini","original_name":"Giancarlo Bernardini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Grandfather 2","credit_id":"6873c5e71c3020f297c09ae0","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5176314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel Quaranta","original_name":"Axel Quaranta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6873c6216ce9d985b0ed7fd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5176314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel Quaranta","original_name":"Axel Quaranta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6873c62d787b8e0829ed8375","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":182250,"name":"personal growth"},{"id":208349,"name":"kids"},{"id":262398,"name":"premature birth"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"6+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
