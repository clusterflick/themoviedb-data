Final version in 35mm.  Synopsis  In Latin America, the 70s and 80s were years darkened by military dictatorships, which forced a policy of terror and extermination. Many of those who lived their childhood during that period have a personal history built as an extremely complex plot. Grito works with throbbing autobiographical memories and Images that resound in the head and block the throat. It is the last step in a series of audiovisual reflections about the relationship between identity, ideology and affection. A Super-8mm and a low-quality digital video entwine in the anachronistic construction of the familiar recollection.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pw76g8NnbgJfOFQMx0Tj87Ffrtk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Denegri","original_name":"Andrés Denegri","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6872cddc0944d3129dc5b7b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pw76g8NnbgJfOFQMx0Tj87Ffrtk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
