It was released on December 6, 1998, despite the original tape claiming to be copyrighted in 1999 and was later reissued that same year. It includes the classical music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and colorful toys from the 90's. It was one of the 10 videos to be created by Julie Aigner-Clark. In 2000, the sound design for Baby Bach was updated by Bill Weisbach. A new Baby Bach CD came out when the sound design was updated. Later in 2004, Disney re-released the video with some of the toys replaced for new ones.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/h5BBFaMg8QDOeqIfIopuVH70eVT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72308,"logo_path":"/uWSAY8ShgVsIdKtWUyav8QfI2nG.png","name":"The Baby Einstein Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Bach: Musical Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Baby Einstein - Baby Bach","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":87408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Aigner-Clark","original_name":"Julie Aigner-Clark","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68745df29dbe918916105c93","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h5BBFaMg8QDOeqIfIopuVH70eVT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
