This film examines a Chinese woman's journey to America to give birth to an anchor baby, reflecting the struggles of over 10,000 women who make this choice annually. Isolated in a foreign land, she grapples with suffocating doubts: Am I ready for motherhood? Did I make the right decision? Confined to one apartment, the story uses surrealism to depict her inner turmoil. The film also explores human connection, transcending language and cultural barriers, showcasing how women support and empower one another despite their differences.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vMzhk4B69qRA8LNCtNCa0alEzCD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hostage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5558826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Zhou","original_name":"Nicole Zhou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6871b307c55cd072b91053c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5558827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rina Meija","original_name":"Rina Meija","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6871b31df2cd5874466e9d5f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3192839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kvitko","original_name":"Mark Kvitko","popularity":0.4142,"profile_path":"/ytLguwqMS8AHFWkQGQjKjkrA6BR.jpg","credit_id":"6871b279ee498f21056ea3d8","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2416144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martim David Gomes","original_name":"Martim David Gomes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6871b283d150c3cc65a97b2f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467357,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Jiang","original_name":"Alex Jiang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6871b2911d0ef79eab704af8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1148,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vMzhk4B69qRA8LNCtNCa0alEzCD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":765}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
