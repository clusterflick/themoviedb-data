Under the disaster, the city fell into crisis, the virus was repeated, resources were in short, and the plight was aggravated.  Show the appearance of all sentient beings in times of crisis. Some people rush to the front line, some people struggle to survive in the quagmire, some people fall down, and some people stick to it. After 76 days, it was unblocked, and the whistle cut through the sky. No one is a spectator in this period of history. We all support each other in the folds of the times and have gone through difficult times together.","popularity":0.2354,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Angel in White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
