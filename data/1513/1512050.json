The Botswana Special was released as part of a 2-disc DVD boxset alongside the Top Gear: Vietnam Special on 23 March 2009. This special is best remembered for the car Hammond bought, which he fell in love with and named \"Oliver\", which he still owns to this day.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dvqF4UcLyG3TxuvlBy8y1YKauJc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Top Gear: Botswana Special","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nuBrqcaWTUdNZ4owKCKahClsMyt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dvqF4UcLyG3TxuvlBy8y1YKauJc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tUsdlA4SChOFfZLJJnf6W5QYeqc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
