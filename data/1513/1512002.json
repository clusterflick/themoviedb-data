Artistic duo Lior Borochov Hutchings and Kat Willrett invite you to witness their world of the weird and wonderful, bizarre and bemusing in this surreal dance work. Watch fantastical scenes unfold through the eyes of peculiar characters, set against the gritty backdrop of urban Berlin. Bursting with movement, music and striking visuals, “Phantasm” leans into theatrical absurdity and queer aesthetics to explore the tensions between monotony and whimsy, and the notion of existing as an “other”. Taboos within ourselves, feelings of alienation - curious, unapologetic and oftentimes humorous, this work breaks boundaries and basks in its weirdness.  With fantastical characters and poetic visuals, “Phatasm” explores otherness, alienation and taboos. Curious, unapologetic and oftentimes humorous, this work breaks boundaries and basks in its weirdness.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phantasm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5558613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Boventer","original_name":"Florence Boventer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self / Dancer","credit_id":"68718ef107dcb97b72a9764f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5558595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charline Lebailly","original_name":"Charline Lebailly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/97QxY7jilTq9u8UeNWgzKKLhfbo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self / Dancer","credit_id":"68718c74900a7bccc4ed73bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5558615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annika Netzold","original_name":"Annika Netzold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self / Dancer","credit_id":"68718f0bd150c3cc65a97aa6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5558616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Bröker","original_name":"Helena Bröker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self / Dancer","credit_id":"68718f2797e7a847f2ed7625","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5558617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sho Nakasatomi","original_name":"Sho Nakasatomi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self / Dancer","credit_id":"68718f3b445f5aad1c704a81","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5558591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lior Borochov Hutchings","original_name":"Lior Borochov Hutchings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68718c4a0fe24ad4afa97a88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5558593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kat Willrett","original_name":"Kat Willrett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68718c5a6ddea7161651fd8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
