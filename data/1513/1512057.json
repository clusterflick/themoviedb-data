It doesn’t follow any plot. There’s no script. Just weird images and sound and... feelings, I guess. Earl and I threw in everything we had—stop-motion, paper cutouts, weird blurry stuff. It’s abstract. It's confusing. It’s... basically the inside of my brain, turned into a film.  But it was for her.  I didn’t know how to say goodbye. I didn’t even know if I should say goodbye. So instead, I made this weird little thing and projected it on her hospital room wall. And maybe, just maybe, it helped her understand what she meant to me. What she meant to all of us.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/72zPre7KxTc7FesCOk3a9Sr672o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"WARNING: the last person that saw this immediately went in to a coma and DIED","title":"Movie for Rachel","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/72zPre7KxTc7FesCOk3a9Sr672o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
