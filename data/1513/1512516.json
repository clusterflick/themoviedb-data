Their set, lasting about an hour, featured a balance of Currents tracks—such as “Let It Happen,” “Eventually,” and “New Person, Same Old Mistakes”—alongside earlier favorites like “Elephant,” “Mind Mischief,” “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards,” “The Less I Know the Better,” and the Psychedelic cover “Daffodils”.  Filmed in full on video and available online, the performance is often highlighted for Kevin Parker’s barefoot opening and the hypnotic visuals that matched the band’s psychedelic rock style.  This concert is representative of Tame Impala’s mid‑2010s exploration of textured soundscapes and melodic hooks, presented on one of the UK’s largest festival stages.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/otZ2H89oL12mDxy3cFF2dPG06jR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tame Impala live at Glastonbury 2016","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
