But the real drama happened off-screen.  Director Cal Grossman and writer Sagan Davison started out as a dream team. But during the making of the final film, everything fell apart. There were huge creative disagreements, constant rewrites, and one argument so bad it shut down production for days. Sagan left the project. Cal finished the movie alone.  This documentary includes behind-the-scenes footage, cast interviews, deleted scenes, and a closer look at how a strange idea became something way bigger—and messier—than anyone expected.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/amLttIeL78O1A5NyLeOyGP2ZoB6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Monster (Final Cut)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sHDxwFiDeXWjbWTPazQmDvqZegW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2080}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1088,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/amLttIeL78O1A5NyLeOyGP2ZoB6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":725}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
