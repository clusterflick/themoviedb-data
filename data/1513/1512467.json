The filmâ€™s central characters are three longstanding artist-run spaces (also known as DIY spaces) as well as a hundred-year-old bank building located in north Denver. As the residents of these spaces react to their changing environment, and the looming closure of their buildings, we learn about the importance of community and the role art plays in gentrification.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buildings Are Heavy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5560745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Shively","original_name":"Kim Shively","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68730d7a0fe24ad4afa9823e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
