Dispossession in all its forms, yet primarily there is the issue of language. In the short film Le Livre laissé blanc, we explore the protagonist’s conscious journey as she confronts her loss of language within the inner landscape of her wandering. She attempts to remember her lost language or, alternatively, to make the language of the Other her own.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/yK9CPvT4AyCJ5Fu6NlQJNePCOfF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"客人","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le livre laissé blanc","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5562382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Belle","original_name":"Pauline Belle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6874452ef75eacd43f10621b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5562383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Sperber","original_name":"Nathan Sperber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"687445c7ba81d2d162ed808d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiao Xiaoyue","original_name":"Xiao Xiaoyue","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6874461d6ce9d985b0ed818b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5562387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jinjin Sun","original_name":"Jinjin Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6874462de467830aac105e15","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5561671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Ziyang","original_name":"Wang Ziyang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6873c793327a052ea45427c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5562389,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pablo Martin","original_name":"Pablo Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68744651c7334f7c17c09b0e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5562390,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maxime Bauer","original_name":"Maxime Bauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687446710fe24ad4afa98810","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yK9CPvT4AyCJ5Fu6NlQJNePCOfF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
