The wetland is home to several groups of Indigenous peoples as well as rare and endangered wildlife, including species found nowhere else.  But the Pantanal has suffered more fire damage than any other ecosystem.  Told through the journeys of two environmental defenders, and blending beautiful cinematography with insights from scientists, Indigenous leaders and activists, the film is a wake-up call and an invitation to stand alongside those working to protect one of the last truly wild places on the planet.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7xKz9RWfF2xw8QjJxkIedilvmOv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":276941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Environmental Justice Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":161443,"logo_path":null,"name":"EJF Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pantanal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pantanal â€“ Trailer","key":"KfyEYuBE-ik","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-11-12T15:59:46.000Z","id":"68e9de35cedde55ecf1f6152"}]}}}
