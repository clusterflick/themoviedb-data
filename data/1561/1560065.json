It begins with a thoroughly vivid prologue symbolizing the departure of a splendid cruise ship. The performers then wish Nozomi Fuuto the best of luck as the new Top Star with choreography inspired by her name and the four Chinese characters that make it up: 望 (HOPE), 海 (OCEAN), 風 (WIND), and 斗 (BIG DIPPER).  You can look forward to an ultimate piece of entertainment that combines the allure of the new Snow Troupe plus the aesthetics of Nozomi Fuuto's portrayal of male characters as the otokoyaku.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dke6nzdUtDm0yCm0cDnOaaOxvIM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Voyager! －To the Seas of Hope－","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2706186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuuto Nozomi","original_name":"望海風斗","popularity":1.6357,"profile_path":"/zQEz5vazTRtpaF5zE7OIjIWR75R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68e8770c2b1b66709773dd1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3380210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maaya Kiho","original_name":"真彩希帆","popularity":0.1192,"profile_path":"/jAMwxE4UWeTQphaSv4nHu3V4Hay.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68e877179e831c29e3b7af6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3228754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakina Ayakaze","original_name":"彩風咲奈","popularity":1.6053,"profile_path":"/6WbzQjkIQLEpwXJVoSKwEZhZgFY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68e877228b4404e45e30c185","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3347784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Asami","original_name":"朝美絢","popularity":0.268,"profile_path":"/u7ip8C8Z2vnneG0WwyTw7Zue8xG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68e87735d49e9ead71e6aa8c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3386244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayanagi Shou","original_name":"彩凪翔","popularity":0.1296,"profile_path":"/95OopmQEAg3KCH1DSWbgE1dgLAt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68e87743463b4ecdd35f65d9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noguchi Kousaku","original_name":"Noguchi Kousaku","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e877b7c0c90aecc273de31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1215,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eN47cbp1QNFWI5kf8akT8RHMY7b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2160}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1028,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dke6nzdUtDm0yCm0cDnOaaOxvIM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
