This documentary offers the real-life account - an emotional, human story of wrongful detention, resilience, and love. With exclusive access to former hostages and key political decision-makers, Prisoner 951: The Hostages’ Story offers a rare look at the toll of being used as leverage in political negotiations between states. The film lays bare how authoritarian regimes are increasingly using foreign nationals as geopolitical bargaining chips. Through the lens of Nazanin’s six-year imprisonment in Iran, the film examines the wider pattern of wrongful detention, the international failure to prevent it, and the hidden costs to families, diplomacy, and justice.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18944,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Factual Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":159592,"logo_path":"/ytxILooQKRIkq0GvayxptPWunSk.png","name":"Dancing Ledge Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":144640,"logo_path":"/dU4Bna2kbK5S6npO7N1Q5rpOwRn.png","name":"BBC Two","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prisoner 951: The Hostages’ Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3966780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe","original_name":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/jX9ZFeVRTUCxa77zJ0Gxgx2HWa9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68e9a53eaaa424f20f786684","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3479831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ratcliffe","original_name":"Richard Ratcliffe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68e9a5509d4b0c1fe832155c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5742781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anoosheh Ashoori","original_name":"Anoosheh Ashoori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68e9a59cfbcb4195eb9fd580","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5742783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elika Ashoori","original_name":"Elika Ashoori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68e9a5ab64e59c85861a2006","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5742785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kylie Moore-Gilbert","original_name":"Kylie Moore-Gilbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68e9a6b87c9c44163ec3d9d4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3586349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Rezaian","original_name":"Jason Rezaian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68e9a6d1fbcb4195eb9fd58b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2393313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erica Gornall","original_name":"Erica Gornall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e9a74e1007073dc13215c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3229651,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cassie Cornish-Trestrail","original_name":"Cassie Cornish-Trestrail","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e9a7694da206b60ac3da08","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1483133,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fatima Salaria","original_name":"Fatima Salaria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e9a77ec17d844ef86455a4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
