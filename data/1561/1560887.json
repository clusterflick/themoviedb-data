Butch is a rare individual with a unique ability to see the potential in objects that others take for granted. He is considered one of the top naïve artists in Alabama, and, as his artwork is shown in museums around the country, he is becoming a national treasure. Blank’s camera follows Butch to various folk art festivals around the South, visiting the friends and artists who inspired him to create art. Blank also observes Butch’s life in Alabama’s rural landscape. From ‘coon hunting to “calling up” alligators and digging up fossils, Butch Anthony shows us a South not known to many outsiders.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":103759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Blank Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"You Can't Squeeze Blood Out Of A Turnip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Butch Anthony","original_name":"Butch Anthony","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68ea8b7b7b5707fccec3de18","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Blank","original_name":"Les Blank","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/i0qT8dEUIR2tgqZLCx6avfqNx11.jpg","credit_id":"68ea8b86673f1bcf921a2375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":320973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harrod Blank","original_name":"Harrod Blank","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/ff3Eq3CU5HZaKFAxJ3133jimhu7.jpg","credit_id":"68ea8ba7ae299af9644b180f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2075,"name":"alabama"},{"id":226261,"name":"folk art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
