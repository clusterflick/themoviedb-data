According to notes by Renato Venturelli in the 44th Pordenone Silent Film Festival catalogue, the film opens with a view labeled “Villa Negro,” referring to Villetta Di Negro—a public park in Genoa that was formerly a cultural center in the early 19th century. The villa is shown from Piazza Corvetto, with statues of Giuseppe Mazzini and Victor Emmanuel II. The film also includes views of Castello Mackenzie, designed by Gino Coppedè, as well as scenes of a coastal storm, the Cathedral of San Lorenzo, the Church of the Nunziata’s vestibule, the Columbus monument in Piazza Acquaverde, Palazzo Doria (Villa del Principe), and the Staglieno Cemetery. The surviving footage is fragmentary but features consistent image quality and frequent panoramic camera movement.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A silent travelogue of unknown origin, Villa Negro captures Genoa’s cultural and architectural landmarks—from Villetta Di Negro and Castello Mackenzie to churches, monuments, and cemeteries","title":"[Villa Negro]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Unknown date.
