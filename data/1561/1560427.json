S. Subbulakshmi, D. K. Pattammal and Tanjore Brinda. Each in their own individual style has carried forward the rich heritage of Carnatic music in the spirit of the Bhakti devotion. Their purity, expression and dedication is shared by the maestros as they relive their memories and bring alive the image of the Bhakta, poet composer Tyagaraja, who, through his musical wisdom seeks liberation from all sansara or worldly life, and surrenders to this Divine medium. The film explores their music, their life experiences and their devotion towards their music.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":212864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of External Affairs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1997-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boat Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5742363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saroj Satyanarayan","original_name":"Saroj Satyanarayan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e9499f90cc0169d7aa1c90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5742363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saroj Satyanarayan","original_name":"Saroj Satyanarayan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e949afeea49f59374a9efc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":999159,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Madhu Ambat","original_name":"Madhu Ambat","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/Aigs0ffIbHFjXtjSQKha5TMsecz.jpg","credit_id":"68e949ceda558e9ee130c7f1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"L.
