From Barcelona to Serbia. Playing in the living rooms of the CouchSurfing hosts, for only 20 to 30 people, and carpooling as our mean of transport. People didn’t have to pay for a ticket, but everyone had to bring some food so we could all share it after the concert. I travelled with Joan Solé, who recorded everything: adventures, concerts, funny moments, parties, etc.  Back then, all this footage came out as a 14-episode web series, but now that it’s been 10 years since the tour, we’ve put it all together as a documentary and showed it at Cine Texas in a special screening — and from today, you can also watch it online for everyone to watch.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gira Europea 2015","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pau Vallvé","original_name":"Pau Vallvé","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68e853fa74eee2f60f4a9927","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740961,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joan Solé","original_name":"Joan Solé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68e85860842c3432f4e6a977","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pau Vallvé","original_name":"Pau Vallvé","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e85425c70bb0ae5c5f6677","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pau Vallvé","original_name":"Pau Vallvé","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e85682fc13fc81ba41e139","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pau Vallvé","original_name":"Pau Vallvé","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e8597f9c5bcd11ec73dbc9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740961,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joan Solé","original_name":"Joan Solé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e87b4fa98e9aa339d85168","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
