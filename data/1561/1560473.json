Pursued by an unseen threat, he awakens in desolate landscapes where encounters with children and his alter ego compel him to explore desires society deems “different.” From yearning to wear a dress to imagining himself as a cheerleader, Omar’s sensual curiosity unfolds amid shame and confusion. Haunted by envy for those freer to express themselves, he questions whether the apocalypse has destroyed the world—or only his sense of self. Through his surreal journey, Omar discovers that social expectations have wounded him deeply, and he must decide whether to embrace his true identity or keep hiding behind the dance of denial.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ssy9bhM326yIK4zIclENy9crc4F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Shameful Waste of Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4982558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sem Wouters","original_name":"Sem Wouters","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68e95dd14265dc96935f6a5a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5742468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis De Cooman","original_name":"Lewis De Cooman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e95da2da558e9ee130c901","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5742468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis De Cooman","original_name":"Lewis De Cooman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e95da8d84e5512204a9e8c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ssy9bhM326yIK4zIclENy9crc4F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
