In “Hurricane Helene’s Deadly Warning,” Laura Sullivan goes on the ground in North Carolina in the days after the 2024 storm and speaks with survivors who describe the devastation, fear and shock they experienced at seeing entire communities washed away. She revisits Houston, Texas, where thousands of homes remain in an area that already flooded during Harvey in 2017. Sullivan also returns to Staten Island, where, according to a former FEMA director, the billion dollar rebuilding process may not have been enough to prevent mass destruction should another Superstorm Sandy hit.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hurricane Helene's Deadly Warning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2457089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Sullivan","original_name":"Laura Sullivan","popularity":0.3188,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68e9b97c8f793de4e71f60fd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2457089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Sullivan","original_name":"Laura Sullivan","popularity":0.3188,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e9b9568f793de4e71f60fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36612263","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
