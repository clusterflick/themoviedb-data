It is preserved as a 2K DCP (1'31\" at 16 fps) from a 9.5mm reversal print without intertitles, held by Fondazione Home Movies – Archivio Nazionale del Film di Famiglia in Bologna. According to Michele Manzolini in the 44th Pordenone Silent Film Festival catalogue, the film was likely shot in Lavagna, where the Lavello family spent extended stays at their country house, Villa Rocca. The footage captures leisure activities of Nena Lavello and her group of friends, known locally as the “robustine” for their energetic and athletic lifestyle. Scenes include beach outings, sailing, and games. The Pathé Baby camera used for filming was purchased in April 1925 by her father Arturo Lavello, possibly for travel or as a gift.
