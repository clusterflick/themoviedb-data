The film opens with a closeup on a newspaper article that reads, «  What Italian industry offers Asia. Modern manufacturing, sophisticated technology and willingness to do business with the East ». The following sequence is set on a beach, where musicians play Arabic music, and a dancer moves sensually. At a certain point the director, Luginbühl, interrupts the scene, even slapping the dancer's face. This is clearly an allegory of how Western capitalism exploits and enslaves the East.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Palme e Tangeri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2628739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirio Luginbühl","original_name":"Sirio Luginbühl","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/hXp4u7b8irWTnAMSDBN9aiDTLQS.jpg","credit_id":"68eaacb0ae27f61dc61a25f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
