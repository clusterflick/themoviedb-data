Dedicated to her 1957 flight aboard Sputnik-2, the film captures the Cold War atmosphere and the intense space race between the Soviet Union and the United States. Blending rare archival footage with AI-generated imagery, it offers a perspective on a pivotal moment in history—not only as a scientific milestone but also as a profoundly human story of sacrifice, ambition, and moral complexity. Laika Will Never Return to Earth invites viewers to reflect on the cost of progress and the forgotten lives behind grand achievements.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Laika Will Never Return to Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Layka nikogda ne vernetsya na Zemlyu","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5743762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timur Molchansky","original_name":"Тимур Молчанский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ea983ea41cf5c9a07869c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5743763,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristina Kurdyumova","original_name":"Кристина Курдюмова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ea9847ef9d04922b4b1738","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
