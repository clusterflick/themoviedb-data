Modestly, in Don's shadow, Joris follows behind. Don, adorned with status symbols, takes Joris with him, seemingly to a not-so-important mee+ng. In an expensive Mercedes lacking in comfort, the pair drive through narrow streets. As cigare-e smoke fills the car, Joris has to endure his boss's arrogant bravado. When they have to make a stop at Don's house, Joris becomes wary and gradually filled with unease, especially when confronted with all the people in the house catering to Don's every whim.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/RyKzB1m7wNU2oRMaH8ljtgRcij.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239050,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabel
