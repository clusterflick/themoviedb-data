The film begins at the port, between Piazza Raibetta and the commercial district near Palazzo San Giorgio, portraying the city’s active maritime and economic life. It then shifts to the monumental Staglieno Cemetery, offering a contemplative view of Genoa’s funerary architecture and cultural relationship with death. The final segment features the gardens of the 16th-century Palazzo di Andrea Doria (Villa del Principe), historically associated with Giuseppe Verdi and later used for open-air film screenings. Though varied in subject, these locations collectively reflect Genoa’s commercial vitality, commemorative traditions, and aristocratic heritage. The film runs for 1 minute and 37 seconds, includes stencil-coloured sequences, and was distributed in Portuguese under the title Um dia em Genova.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Pathé","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A 1913 travelogue presenting Genoa through three contrasting scenes—its bustling port, monumental cemetery, and aristocratic villa gardens—highlighting the city’s commercial activity, commemorative traditions, and architectural heritage.","title":"A Day in Genoa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Um dia em Genova","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pordenone Silent Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
