I Am Delighted By Your Alchemy explores the memory of a sexual relationship, revealing what one remembers and what one is trying to forget. The film is an intimate portrait of the filmmaker's relationship to a past partner, using superimposition to queer the notion of sex and memory, as well as to blur the boundary between the filmmaker and the subject.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Delighted by Your Alchemy, Turning Everything in My Kingdom to Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1786054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karly Stark","original_name":"Karly Stark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650832ec42d8a500c4fcbed7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1786054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karly Stark","original_name":"Karly Stark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650832f6373ac200e21b985c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4537660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
