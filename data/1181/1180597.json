He travels to Duiwelsvallei, a place where even the devil must tread lightly. He becomes entangled in the peculiar lives of the Duiwelsvallei's people. Initially, things go well, but then murder, jealousy, blood feuds, and betrayal rear their heads. Gerhard becomes ensnared in a love triangle. Not even his girlfriend's suicide can drive the unwanted stranger out of the valley. Only blood, his own, that of his ex-wife, and his best friend Bergsma's, will allow him to leave Duiwelsvallei.","popularity":0.121,"poster_path":"/p1QojyVUdqEhBTZwf1jDUbXJ51f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monarch Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1974-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ongewenste Vreemdeling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marius Weyers","original_name":"Marius Weyers","popularity":0.3335,"profile_path":"/8Ya9IhLm7T0uVVVXebCynSnrx3y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gerhard Steenberg","credit_id":"65097803fa27f4014eb2e93b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Kotze","original_name":"Sandra Kotze","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lida","credit_id":"6509780e3cd12c012de94c53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Trengove","original_name":"Barry Trengove","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Paul Bergsma","credit_id":"65097817394a8700ada8e6b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie du Toit","original_name":"Marie du Toit","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eleen Zeiler","credit_id":"65097822373ac20139005bf0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dulcie van den Bergh","original_name":"Dulcie van den Bergh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ralie","credit_id":"650978368a88b200e39f3a63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anele Jonker","original_name":"Anele Jonker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mitz","credit_id":"6509783f42d8a57e997af8d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4238879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Tjaden","original_name":"Marie Tjaden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6509784afa27f4012d5bfafa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Regardt van den Bergh","original_name":"Regardt van den Bergh","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Grové","credit_id":"65097854fa27f4012d5bfafe","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manie Botha","original_name":"Manie Botha","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Peet Lubbe","credit_id":"6509785efa27f4010c4bf451","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerrie du Pré","original_name":"Gerrie du Pré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Barry","credit_id":"650978688261ee013967616e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sann de Lange","original_name":"Sann de Lange","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Maggie","credit_id":"65097876394a8700e227af6d","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jans Rautenbach","original_name":"Jans Rautenbach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650978c78a88b2011db32e4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jans Rautenbach","original_name":"Jans Rautenbach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650978ce3cd12c00eb461f2a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"C.F.
