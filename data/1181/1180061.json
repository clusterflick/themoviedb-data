As she describes her sins, the viewer is transported into her sapphic fantasies before climaxing in a surprise twist ending. \"The Confession\" is written, directed, filmed, edited, and cast entirely by sex workers in British Columbia, Canada. The film focuses on exploring queer desire within the confines of a church confessional booth, as inspired by the writer's own lived experiences facing homophobia (both internalized and externalized) and realizing her queer identity.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/ikIBFz3ectjmvYLO8sBK6mwO1pM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Confession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4277359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"GoAskAlex","original_name":"GoAskAlex","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6507745cfa27f4010c4accaa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4277360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Mae","original_name":"Fiona Mae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65077472394a8700c5bdf8cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4277361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ondreeah","original_name":"Ondreeah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6507747c8a88b200ad5d2d73","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4277363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabxth Fields","original_name":"Elizabxth Fields","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6507748dfa27f400eb17dfc9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4277364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Margo","original_name":"Prince Margo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"650774993cd12c012de82a8a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4277365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natie Delaire","original_name":"Natie Delaire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6507749f373ac200c532836f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4277358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ursinae Vespéral","original_name":"Ursinae Vespéral","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6507744b394a870139160283","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ikIBFz3ectjmvYLO8sBK6mwO1pM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
