The project uses found footage as a method for emphasizing the cinematic collisions between audio and visual composition. Working within the margins of structural filmmaking, Trouble with Johnny creates a visceral experience of fragmented sounds and cyclical imagery.  Likewise, Trouble with Johnny functions as a parody of the mainstream movie industry. The source material derives from the 1980’s coming of age film, The Karate Kid. Throughout the story, the main antagonist, a bully who goes by the name “Johnny”, is revered by a dedicated clique of subservient underlings. Applied as an experimental technique, the repetitive use of the word “Johnny” draws attention to the stereotypical and recurring tropes found in many teen movies.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble with Johnny","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Echeverria","original_name":"Paul Echeverria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65074fdb394a87011c9d839c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
