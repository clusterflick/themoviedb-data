He is also called the forefather of existentialism: Sören Kierkegaard, born in Copenhagen in 1813. At the request of his father, he studied theology. He sees himself as a poet and philosopher, but always on a mission to fight for an unadulterated Christianity. His fanatical fight against an overly saturated and bourgeois church sapped his strength to such an extent that he died at the age of 42. Kierkegaard did not only set great impulses in his time. He has not lost his topicality until today. His complicated personality, his radical demands become clear for the first time in his writings.","popularity":0.1181,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205917,"logo_path":"/cZhXPKEUUuX3lkwjElNjS5zylWC.png","name":"Aladin Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entweder oder - Die Existenz des Sören Kierkegaard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lutz Winde","original_name":"Lutz Winde","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sören Kierkegaard","credit_id":"6507932642d8a500fe3b52ca","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4206054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans S.
