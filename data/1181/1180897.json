The Dionne Quintuplets follows Cecile, Emilie, Marie, Yvonne and Annette through twenty-one years of strange upbringing. When the girls were just infants, the premier of Ontario issued a court order removing them from parental care. Cut off from the world and their family, over-publicized, viewed twice daily in a special viewing compound, they grew up as prize exhibits. Director Donald Brittain uses old newsreel footage, home-movie sequences and interviews to depict a historic event that became a tragic exploitation of a family.","popularity":0.2647,"poster_path":"/qbt0YHUdAGaKVqfLlfez60ggSe1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1978-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dionne Quintuplets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Dionne","original_name":"Annette Dionne","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"650a45320d5d85011aece81a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cécile Dionne","original_name":"Cécile Dionne","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"650a454b1b5ae500c4aaa1bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Émilie Dionne","original_name":"Émilie Dionne","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"650a45799661fc01ed691cd8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Dionne","original_name":"Marie Dionne","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"650a4588cadb6b00e11f4e84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Dionne","original_name":"Yvonne Dionne","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"650a459bd6c30000cce0e4b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Berton","original_name":"Pierre Berton","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":"/bMj7WlADabiTDoT3H4bHHZ41vhJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6574ec027a3c52014e694327","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Brittain","original_name":"Donald Brittain","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/jSp8rMTzF5HI6ZvdFJ6PrkHJTCv.jpg","credit_id":"650a45e11b5ae500ab818064","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0165712","wikidata_id":"Q123287703","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4SHMg2ueP4ruAUy4FiECMisqzyr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ihkF7DYRyu2SkPih76qOwuypYRV.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qbt0YHUdAGaKVqfLlfez60ggSe1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":213113,"name":"quintuplets"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
