Her husband and her father wants her to go to therapy, and Ana decides, as a repair exercise (in desperation), to make a documentary about the bitcoin fever with a producer (more fundamentalist than Michael Saylor), a technical team of new speculators (three to the room) and an economist father (a boomer) who wants to avoid at all costs that his daughter is ruined in a market he does not understand. For him, crypto are the tulip or stamp bubble of the 21st century: a lifelong scam. Ana's story will serve as a trojan horse to delve into the crypto ecosystem through expert testimonials.","popularity":0.1858,"poster_path":"/e3MmfomS7to9U3Kqv1xyKTwrTal.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bull Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Ramón Rubio","original_name":"Ana Ramón Rubio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a21d49661fc01ed690cd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Ramón Rubio","original_name":"Ana Ramón Rubio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a22e51b5ae50138e3764f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345836,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Celia Riera","original_name":"Celia Riera","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a2306d6c300012fcf4ba9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16302704","wikidata_id":"Q114094886","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4jySMXDngNBZVspWRfN3hYY39KH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1422}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/e3MmfomS7to9U3Kqv1xyKTwrTal.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cnema Jove","release_date":"2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Madrid","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
