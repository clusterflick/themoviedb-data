In 1980s Los Angeles, Sarah Traister Moskovitz and her colleague Flo Kinsler founded the first Child Survivors of the Holocaust therapy and support group which went on to be a worldwide phenomenon. For the first time this generation of child survivors, then in their 40s and 50s, could name their experience, find community and begin to heal. Now in their 80s and 90s, these survivors consider themselves to be \"phantom siblings\" with Sarah as their \"mother.\" The film was created by teens who worked with an artist mentor over Zoom, using their phones as cameras and cardboard boxes as animation stands. It is a production of The Righteous Conversations Project, a collaboration of Holocaust survivors and teens, based in Los Angeles and now in its tenth year.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/kFnl9S6MsbPXZ5sJgkZ0e1zZfne.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am A Traister: The Sarah Moskovitz Story","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Traister-Moskovitz","original_name":"Sarah Traister-Moskovitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"650a5a53aede5900fe5f30c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itzik Moskovitz","original_name":"Itzik Moskovitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"650b16c26c19ea00ca46d61a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa Biggs","original_name":"Alexa Biggs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5a781b5ae5011b1e1bd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bella Rahi","original_name":"Bella Rahi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5b0b6c19ea014f4b4296","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ella Levkowitz","original_name":"Ella Levkowitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5ae10d5d850138e70c83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20171,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Samara Hutman","original_name":"Samara Hutman","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/8abp0KfbR50oWuHGvHSfkyrWwec.jpg","credit_id":"650a5b581b5ae500e17c2759","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asher Meron","original_name":"Asher Meron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5af40d5d8500fdb763c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280703,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Ullendorff","original_name":"Henry Ullendorff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5b21cadb6b011bbe1b1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2425857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cheri Gaulke","original_name":"Cheri Gaulke","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5b6b0d5d8500e051eca2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Tomlinson","original_name":"Lynn Tomlinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5bacd6c30000cce0f433","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Uzielli","original_name":"Olivia Uzielli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5b301b5ae500feeead8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veronica Howard","original_name":"Veronica Howard","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5ab86c19ea00adec56ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Izadora Kashper","original_name":"Izadora Kashper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5ad2aede5900fe5f3115","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lincoln Weinstock","original_name":"Lincoln Weinstock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a5b400d5d8500e051ec7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29258667","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bCVMXY8rLpTj4aKGsH0yO3bHkdb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kFnl9S6MsbPXZ5sJgkZ0e1zZfne.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
