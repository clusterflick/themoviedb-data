Both fishplants had locked their doors rather than recognize the Canadian Fishermen's Union as official bargaining agent. For eight weeks, as autumn turned to winter, the men, with their wives and families, held firm. It was a bread-and-butter struggle that made national headlines--one of the first major attempts by Nova Scotia fishermen and fishhandlers to win union recognition, and one of the first major tests of the N.S. Trade Union Act, passed in 1937.","popularity":0.1351,"poster_path":"/88ElnbAXAhOw5kHxZQ6Lae1waMw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fish or Cut Bait Collective","origin_country":""},{"id":139222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic Filmmakers Cooperative (AFCOOP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1979-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Finest Kind: A People's History of the Lockeport Lockout, 1939","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Burger","original_name":"Tom Burger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65076cde3cd12c00ad8b709b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill McKiggan","original_name":"Bill McKiggan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65076cec8a88b20100098e25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/88ElnbAXAhOw5kHxZQ6Lae1waMw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"},{"id":340675,"name":"canadian fishermen's union"},{"id":340676,"name":"lockeport, nova scotia"},{"id":340677,"name":"the n.s. trade union act"},{"id":340678,"name":"lockout"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
