The story follows Paul Tard, a geek on the eve of his high school graduation. Paul's friends are throwing a graduation party with hookers and drugs, but, when they come up one hooker short, Paul is uninvited to the party. Drowning his sorrows in wine stolen from a homeless man, Paul decides to take a bubble bath and bring along his laptop for some internet porn. Of course, the laptop falls in the bathtub and Paul electrocutes himself to death. None of this would have happened if he'd only been invited to the party, so Paul sells his soul to a demon in exchange for the power to take revenge on his former friends.","popularity":0.3828,"poster_path":"/zmKZjGgDQCxRgUwxoe8KHN4cOOa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238203,"logo_path":null,"name":"UnitShifter Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":246161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halo8 Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Possess the girls.
