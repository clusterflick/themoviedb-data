All three of them escaped death by seconds. Berriff had approached Battalion Chief Mike Puzziferri a few months earlier about making a film. And on the morning of September 11th, he'd been at the station with his camera rolling. Following the tragedy, Berriff and Puzziferri worked together to produce this compelling and emotional film that examines the effects that tragic day had on the NFD and their families.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/11: The Firefighters' Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
