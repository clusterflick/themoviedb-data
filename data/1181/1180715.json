The dinosaur icon shifts from narratives of extinction, to human exceptionalism, and power. Its materiality whether fossil or plastic toy has, through popular culture, become entrenched in the imaginary of oil extraction and fossil fuel production. Notes from the Anthropocene is a speculative iconological look at the dinosaur, delivered by an imagined museum guide who ponders our symbolic relationship to an increasing ambivalence towards the natural world. The mythic dinosaurs that emerge resist domestication and seek to transcend fantasies of human dominion.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/agcgtPi47y222evZzBcsdm2zaqK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes from the Anthropocene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terra Long","original_name":"Terra Long","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/zaWNmLhj5fV3uGJfbZ1FqLzOgXV.jpg","credit_id":"6509ce63fdc4fa00e27de560","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/agcgtPi47y222evZzBcsdm2zaqK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
