It was the backbone of a society. And then the cod fishery off the east coast of Newfoundland collapsed. Taking Stock traces the history leading up to the crisis and the calling for a moratorium of the northwest Atlantic cod fishery. It presents the key players in this complex and tragic story, focusing on those who are now trying to come to grips with an uncertain future. How did the calamity happen? What signals did we ignore? Did we chose the right model in setting up an industry? Ultimately, Taking Stock holds a message for the Canadian as well as the global community: In trying to attain economic success, we must recognize that there are limits to how far we can exploit nature's delicate ecosystems.","popularity":0.6366,"poster_path":"/2GuhfKRai0qE9W6bB5ie5bcC8M3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taking Stock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5376784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Brookes","original_name":"Chris Brookes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":44,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"67fff38af39c730125d92550","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135567,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Markham","original_name":"Nigel Markham","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/qkj2OkKXpEFgD9x9Djp1dn4TEez.jpg","credit_id":"6508721a394a8700e2271fba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marilyn A.
