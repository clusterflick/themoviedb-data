Home to jobbing builder Fred West, his wife Rose and an assortment of mutilated corpses. During the sixteen gruesome years until 1987, the couple brutally, sadistically and cruelly murdered the victims, including their own children. Sex obsessed Rose sold her body and bedded her lodgers while Fred, a modern day Marquis de Sade, tortured and raped then dug and buried, dismembering bodies to try preventing identification should they be found. Together they trawled the streets looking for new fodder to satisfy their warped lusts. Finally, a chance remark led to the evil being uncovered. Fred delivered himself to the Devil but the law decreed Rose should wait for her reunion with her monster husband.","popularity":0.0339,"poster_path":"/3P3dwy3bIDsrR1UzdcV3RyYidL0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fred and Rosemary West - The House Of Horrors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3P3dwy3bIDsrR1UzdcV3RyYidL0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
