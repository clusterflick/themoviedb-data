They’re also about theatre pieces that we only get to know through the narration of it. The performance is over, the actors step off the stage, the audience leaves the theater. However,in this case, the end marks the beginning. Eleven spectators star in their own tales, intertwined in a collage crafted by life itself. Restaurant and movie theater owners, immigrants and tourists, regulars and passers-by interact with the urban entourage and the people they come across, weaving a mosaic of endless possibilities. Third film of The Audience series by Mariano Pensotti.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Public / Het Publiek","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Oppo","original_name":"Alexandra Oppo","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/v1ggvVAjN0ER1Z6JhfFpIYG8WLg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"628ab4cd7f1d83006a201d97","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2598797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariano Pensotti","original_name":"Mariano Pensotti","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628ab4a99a6435005092bdb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2598797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariano Pensotti","original_name":"Mariano Pensotti","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628ab4b9dd83fa009dabcd85","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
