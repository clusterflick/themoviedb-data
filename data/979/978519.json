It earned them gushing reviews, three Grammy nominations and high-profile fans like Robert Plant and Jack White. Watching them on stage, it's easy to see why. At their sold out Sydney gig, the Shakes were powerful, playful and gut-wrenchingly good. At the centre of it all lies Howard, a howling storm of soul and swagger, who proved as charming as she is cheeky. Your front row seat to this sublime show awaits... get comfy.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/7BBVa4hKGlY0KzVK8HDlNcyxKEw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alabama Shakes: Live at The Metro Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7BBVa4hKGlY0KzVK8HDlNcyxKEw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
