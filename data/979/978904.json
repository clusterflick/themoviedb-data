He quickly learns that he has to pass as a cisgender male for emotional and physical safety. The problem is that he wasn't socialized as a male and lacks the nuance of being a 'man'. His nightly route starts by driving his best friend Niki, a professional dancer, to the strip club where she works. With each new passenger, Eli's performance of gender shifts and unfolds. The film explores the ways in which queer and trans people survive in the gig economy and navigate gender socialization.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":"/ozcTSwjnjzCXBoT76it9ydOYR0Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hey Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Choyce","original_name":"Kai Choyce","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"628adeb92495ab527c4b291e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyler O'Neal","original_name":"Kyler O'Neal","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"628adec50b73160050c1b0f1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2245670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Tillman","original_name":"Kai Tillman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628adee57f1d830054781d35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2245670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Tillman","original_name":"Kai Tillman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628adf037d5db51b2aa18d9a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560405,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"N.
