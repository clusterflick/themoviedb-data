However, Brittany was for a long time a forgotten land, neglected by the Republic which forbade its language. From the 1960s onwards, the agricultural revolution turned peasant life upside down. Its culture, which had long been supported by Catholic priests, was emancipated in the seventies, carried by a new breath of air that accompanied the Breton angers. The youth then reappropriated their language and culture. From the long years of relegation to their great anger, the Bretons have written a fascinating saga since the end of the 19th century.","popularity":0.2715,"poster_path":"/8igqNdbL1dtAalIeGremMhY3H08.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La grande histoire de la Bretagne","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Brunnquell","original_name":"Frédéric Brunnquell","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628a714e7f1d83006a1efad8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Brunnquell","original_name":"Frédéric Brunnquell","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628a716cb513a813b1edbc2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19898562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7rQOiSCr83e5K2fW73nMg6ZbPZA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ipJlexnsFIZTuSvV1Pq3KdFu5ny.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8igqNdbL1dtAalIeGremMhY3H08.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":682},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gsDybKB67qDr8y1MN28UlkGkth2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":251150,"name":"cultural identity"},{"id":273704,"name":"cultural history"},{"id":280999,"name":"history and legacy"},{"id":281588,"name":"traditional values"},{"id":295812,"name":"testimony"},{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"},{"id":322242,"name":"traditional dance"},{"id":325929,"name":"conservative values"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"diffusion de France  3","release_date":"2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6},{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Diffusion sur Public Sénat","release_date":"2023-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
