His victims were usually elderly, vulnerable and trusting. Some needed help to ease the pain that came with age. Others simply sought re-assurance. All received a death sentence from the man who had taken an oath to save life. From his practice in a Cheshire market town, Shipman achieved infamy as Britain's worst ever serial killer. Officially his victims numbered 15. But he murdered at least 215 times and possibly 1,000. His own greed finally snared Doctor Death, whose evil was exposed through the love of a daughter for her mother, sending him on the path to Hell.","popularity":0.636,"poster_path":"/fcTcQzgXdYmu2rO9lW9lh8eWkvz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harold Shipman - Dr Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fcTcQzgXdYmu2rO9lW9lh8eWkvz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1025,"name":"great britain"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"},{"id":14781,"name":"patient"},{"id":336853,"name":"diamorphine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
