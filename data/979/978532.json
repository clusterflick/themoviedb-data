Now spectacular footage reveals another side to this hunters killing power. We follow a family of lion cubs as they start out in life. Seven out of the eight cubs are male - for them the clock is ticking, within two years they need to learn to hunt before setting out and finding new territories of their own, to avoid treading on the toes of the dominant pride male. The cubs hunting lessons are perhaps not what you might expect; instead of ambushing their prey and quickly despatching with a clean bite to the throat, these lions wrestle their victim to the ground and tuck in before the hapless beast is dead. When the prey is a young elephant, it means a slow and painful death. Are these lions behaving badly or is it simply that this is what lions do?","popularity":0.2047,"poster_path":"/33nV7iqi1XScnIsJYYJWF9qqoEy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquavision TV Productions","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2005-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lions Behaving Badly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Killers or Kings","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Lions of Makalolo","type":"Aquavision new title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2060167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Jenkinson","original_name":"Karl Jenkinson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/uHOth0ttuc6jSj5N2j2neLB6uIH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"642b2006c044290298cfcc60","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2981635,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sue Western","original_name":"Sue Western","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b1ff68de0ae00f4c14667","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Coles","original_name":"Phil Coles","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b201201b1ca00e3ab9d67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":967486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carl Hall","original_name":"Carl Hall","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b201ec044290236cc5341","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lamberti","original_name":"Peter Lamberti","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/ciZi1ZYejq504rPLCuGdrf2hN2O.jpg","credit_id":"642b2029f1b571011353eb2c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3491795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zilke Lemmer","original_name":"Zilke Lemmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b203ea3e4ba3d3e130260","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3992926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Stirling Taylor","original_name":"Paul Stirling Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b2048a3e4ba3248d855cf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861483,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Willem van Heerden","original_name":"Willem van Heerden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5szadKdzT5ejR69HfETx67N4G1T.jpg","credit_id":"642b20519cc67b05796c65e4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861483,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Willem van Heerden","original_name":"Willem van Heerden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5szadKdzT5ejR69HfETx67N4G1T.jpg","credit_id":"642b2056ac8e6b00f20a5131","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3491795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zilke Lemmer","original_name":"Zilke Lemmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b20609cc67b05e2025459","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990332,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gillian Matchett","original_name":"Gillian Matchett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b2068f1b57100f4c13cf8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1234,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/33nV7iqi1XScnIsJYYJWF9qqoEy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":823}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
