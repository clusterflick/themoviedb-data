Among the black coastal rocks and ancient stone ramparts, each leap is absolute freedom and a breath of fresh air amid the boredom of the long summer vacation.  During the endless sweltering days, everlasting friendships are forged around this defining tradition, as the ranks of youth are replenished from generation to generation. The film unveils a nostalgic and stirring world of friendships, dangers and displays of bravery – all anchored in the experience of youthful masculinity atop the ancient city walls.","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":"/hmdfumfSDBxZB1A1RmYmmxBOQip.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69876,"logo_path":"/v7gdSf4axBusClUrAjcFM7GE4iX.png","name":"Daroma Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":116016,"logo_path":"/yrrmF7zlFFJAiCGOTdp8LDv8ZRH.png","name":"Kan","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":100053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gesher Multicultural Film Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2024-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acre Wall Jumpers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4736833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Hacohen Naor","original_name":"Donna Hacohen Naor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6653204421b7f4f56b25ed04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3236605,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aharon Pe'er","original_name":"Aharon Pe'er","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320a621b7f4f56b25ed28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687864,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ori Derdikman","original_name":"Ori Derdikman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320dbe3b5af9d3b0f2388","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4736833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Hacohen Naor","original_name":"Donna Hacohen Naor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320b6606f75902b1744ea","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548248,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Haggai Arad","original_name":"Haggai Arad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6653208b33a5a600030f23aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4736834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Firas Roby","original_name":"Firas Roby","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66532050dae08a406d71ae54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elad Peleg","original_name":"Elad Peleg","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320978b13ca7a5bb3eb5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4736834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Firas Roby","original_name":"Firas Roby","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320e68b13ca7a5bb3eb61","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4302775,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Akram Haddad","original_name":"Akram Haddad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320f68105694792b3eabf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4736834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Firas Roby","original_name":"Firas Roby","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320c0819a4e2884b3ebe6","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687864,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ori Derdikman","original_name":"Ori Derdikman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665320d22d0d06bc0e71ada5","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32398627","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oFfaVIc4nNTQhZXkE6MFQ0tTvON.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1234,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hmdfumfSDBxZB1A1RmYmmxBOQip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":884}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
