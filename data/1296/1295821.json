A hand-drawn animation. Claude is a small and silent boy who carries around a box to which he keeps adding dials, antenna, etc. His parents are extremely rich, throughout the film Calude’s father keeps telling his son: “Claude, you’ll never amount to anything.” Mother several times exasperatedly asks him: “Can’t you do anything, Claude?”. Claude says nothing but, in the end, he has the last act: he twiddles the dials on his completed box and vaporizes both parents.","popularity":0.0905,"poster_path":"/80JkoCy4gv3JkFczkDD7hBUbNwj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claude","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4736242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Drury","original_name":"Jon Drury","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Claude's Dad","credit_id":"6652a66e79b6135a62a6e2cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Cagney","original_name":"Jeanne Cagney","popularity":0.2704,"profile_path":"/ghcJ4v0bsnPdAlWzJMXgxd5mQ78.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Claude's Mom","credit_id":"6652a68238fc4b80ac07b7d0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1665788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan McLaughlin","original_name":"Dan McLaughlin","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/cepUGlTeOyg5BuHpFRWedDHr83t.jpg","credit_id":"6652a64caf492ab96ec61541","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1665788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan McLaughlin","original_name":"Dan McLaughlin","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/cepUGlTeOyg5BuHpFRWedDHr83t.jpg","credit_id":"6652a643af492ab96ec6153d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606166,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hank Levine","original_name":"Hank Levine","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a04515e4ec85c48d2e818e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6282352","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/80JkoCy4gv3JkFczkDD7hBUbNwj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQq5rIDNf08w8Rjy80eGfLS9NvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
