The communities are accompanied by Israeli human rights activists. The film follows the complexity of the 'human layer' that disturbs the peacefulness of the desert and awakens ancient struggles. All this, against the backdrop of, and perhaps in contrast to, the wonderful scenery of the desert.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/hr1IJQaBzYQv44mXNGLdX4uOvDN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shepherd’s Keeper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4734503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Hirschfeld","original_name":"Guy Hirschfeld","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66513926e75bd006a2731fd1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4734508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hadara Oren","original_name":"Hadara Oren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665139838838d1797d99860c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hadara Oren","original_name":"Hadara Oren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651398fe832b79547558c72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hadara Oren","original_name":"Hadara Oren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665139b1d3510d64a122fc8f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hadara Oren","original_name":"Hadara Oren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665139c30b8a4f28e65587f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32430388","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hr1IJQaBzYQv44mXNGLdX4uOvDN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1142}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv 2024","release_date":"2024-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
