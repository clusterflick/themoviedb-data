The result is what you see, a film trailer, reborn from its very same ashes, in which the few small portions of “images” that remain are overcome by the freed, colorful chemicals. Blocking is, thus, an homage to all the footage lost by the unpredictable dangers of nature and, at the same time, a true song to the beauty in destruction.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/wT1ceXiBW2dVd7aunVBUEHx9RCN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2005-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blocking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Marín","original_name":"Pablo Marín","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/wbIIBzoDgF0YU5Fy5AVXj9GYNeB.jpg","credit_id":"6650834c3ae5ac502b85d043","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Marín","original_name":"Pablo Marín","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/wbIIBzoDgF0YU5Fy5AVXj9GYNeB.jpg","credit_id":"67e449927bff09b3c4fc455b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Marín","original_name":"Pablo Marín","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/wbIIBzoDgF0YU5Fy5AVXj9GYNeB.jpg","credit_id":"67e449ed6b54f11bee8e7f35","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wT1ceXiBW2dVd7aunVBUEHx9RCN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lXfHa7LWtK6poa8JyPnii863kZJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q99kT5tk6jV74eFdRjlQMzHXfRx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":841}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
