Combining choreographed sequences alongside verite snatches of walkers, joggers, bird watchers, children, parents, dogs, dreamers, dancers and more, the film suggests the interconnectedness of urban denizens, who for a moment share s space and time with one another. Tthe inspiration for this theme was the totem pole, an indigenous art form in North America, where animals, and occasionally humans are seen to be so interconnected, they literally transform seamlessly.from one to the other -- from crow to bear to serpent to human. In the video realization of this idea, in a busy historic urban landmark, updates this native cosmology -- allowing a new type of transformational imagining.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brooklyn Totem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733265,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Susan Hamovitch","original_name":"Susan Hamovitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66508b4e39cb10f7d6dd97c0","department":"Lighting","job":"Directing Lighting Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art of Brooklyn Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
