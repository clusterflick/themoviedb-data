But over the years, that everyday grind can wear you out. Sometimes the money is just not enough and the politics that goes into that can make you question morality at its core. My experimental short film Howl was written at a time when I needed to purge many of those emotions. You give your best to a position and hope it’ll be genuinely recognized where it matters. But time and time again, you’re let down by those who are in higher command. It’s a tricky line to walk, but it’s survival.\" - Martin Del Carpio","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2421854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Del Carpio","original_name":"Martin Del Carpio","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66508c4202b79c2983350e45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Gerigk","original_name":"Martin Gerigk","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66508c4f05b667e3ed068a3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art of Brooklyn Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
