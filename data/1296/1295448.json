Through a gripping narrative structure, like a suspenseful legal drama, the film unfolds the historical, political, and psychological reality that shaped and triggered the event. A cinematic montage created by the intertwined plotlines, emphasizes immense gaps, conflicting narratives, and deep divides between Jews and Arabs who are destined to live together on the same land. If we begin to recognize these gaps, will there be hope for reconciliation?","popularity":1.4332,"poster_path":"/bLXlgyL2Wr24y5rj3rXyB7hiGE4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trabelsi
