The film focuses on community cohesion, survival and creative solutions in the era of the deficit economy and socialist planned economy, aiming to not only delve into the past, but also to appeal to the younger generation with its humour and to show them the sometimes burlesque-like everyday life of the 1970s and 1980s.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brigádnapló","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Szőke András","original_name":"Szőke András","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/pHjfVtAyP78BpNAaUpnwM6u4MbL.jpg","credit_id":"6652d2bb705c86668534d3d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
