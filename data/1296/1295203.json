In NASA's new era of \"faster, better, cheaper,\" this mission had to create a radically different way of building a spacecraft. \"The Pathfinders\" tells the story of a small group of JPL'ers who dismissed warnings that a cut-rate mission to Earth's distant neighbor would cut short their careers.\r With a Martian parachute that could not be tested in Earth's atmosphere, and the last-minute addition of a remote controlled vehicle that would not look out of place in a toy store, the Pathfinder mission was a doubter's dream.\r Vet the future prospects of JPL and of a Mars program in its infancy, depended on bouncing successfully onto the rocky Red Planet and releasing a curious six-wheeled wanderer, in hopes of starting a revolution in space exploration.","popularity":0.421,"poster_path":"/alUbCVjWlcme6vQwnhPpp4HPBUV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"JPL","title":"The Pathfinders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blaine Baggett","original_name":"Blaine Baggett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650daf4bf0727801195d4b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733884,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Blaine Baggett","original_name":"Blaine Baggett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650db02e832b795475572b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Blaine Baggett","original_name":"Blaine Baggett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650db1a12a19135e94b5603","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733887,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Beck","original_name":"John Beck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650db4f08b39309975572d6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733888,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kevin Lane","original_name":"Kevin Lane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650db6a0786ca6fc2905d35","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733891,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Arthur Hurley","original_name":"Arthur Hurley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650dba05a83fb575f4b5602","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Conway","original_name":"Erik Conway","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650dbf3bf0727801195d4e4","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Cinco-Farrell","original_name":"Laura Cinco-Farrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650dc06f7cdc855cb587aab","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733895,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Neil Ross","original_name":"Neil Ross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6650dc2ed6c3460cdb26b94b","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":2233,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/alUbCVjWlcme6vQwnhPpp4HPBUV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1608}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1432,"name":"nasa"},{"id":191132,"name":"space exploration"},{"id":320895,"name":"mars"},{"id":332819,"name":"jpl"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
