The gods had abandoned the earth and the three races of Humans, Asuras and Vanars were embroiled in a bitter struggle. The final apocalyptic battle left many brave warriors dead, and the kings of the three races finally realized the folly of war.That day on the battlefield a pact was made; there would be no more war.
