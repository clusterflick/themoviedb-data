Keishiro introduces himself while Shoko is cleaning, and she recalls her husband mentioning a visitor, reluctantly preparing a meal for him. Frustrated by Jimpachi's silence about Keishiro, Shoko confronts him, but he remains tight-lipped, further irritating her. As Keishiro addresses Shoko as \"Okami\" (landlady) and speaks informally with Jimpachi, his innocent and unpretentious nature gradually wins Shoko over. Despite initial irritation, Shoko is drawn to Keishiro's kindness and dependability as they spend more time together.","popularity":0.4855,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9300,"logo_path":"/9sSD1XufVCJWAadNiC9Mwu994VD.png","name":"TV Asahi","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Beloved Is My Husband's Boss?!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chōichirō Kawarasaki","original_name":"河原崎長一郎","popularity":0.4262,"profile_path":"/4p3XvFKQtpztTKkNpbaECLQ2Hn5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jimpachi Kodera","credit_id":"6651b79e51cdf8f5ba9609a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kunihiko Mitamura","original_name":"三田村邦彦","popularity":0.2586,"profile_path":"/7XUSLZZKI7sQNab1KeQL0y2f9uQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Keishiro Kanie","credit_id":"6651b7ac08b393099755a62f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shima Iwashita","original_name":"岩下志麻","popularity":1.0241,"profile_path":"/1dMsifeO8GoAbA3ycEGYni3w0E1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Shoko","credit_id":"6651b7b9ef2b3f8cd523152d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1938529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumiko Fujiyoshi","original_name":"藤吉久美子","popularity":0.1376,"profile_path":"/22XTsPgegVb8qFeRELU1XvFMnhm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6651b7eaecfb5a929fa6a8f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinichiro Okano","original_name":"Shinichiro Okano","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/dGnmjS5LNOac3YG05Wpy1vCSrux.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6651b7f165e6d2132699a0eb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yatsuko Tan'ami","original_name":"丹阿弥谷津子","popularity":0.4199,"profile_path":"/n7X1uuDN1XvOA4K7ndTI07oN5qv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6651b7f72f034cc09b231836","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103489,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toshiaki Tsushima","original_name":"津島利章","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651b87a1af2c9f248a273b6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sadao Nakajima","original_name":"中島貞夫","popularity":0.6272,"profile_path":"/osi6Cvnqd8WKhmJCRtgGFb2dmwx.jpg","credit_id":"6651b7170b8a4f28e655a2b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614083,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kengo Inomata","original_name":"Kengo Inomata","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651b72a1af2c9f248a27381","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72499,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shuhei Fujisawa","original_name":"藤沢周平","popularity":0.2047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651b73cd33c4366dd9613a4","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32135359","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fEElTq0gbePKviVwFTZi1ze6ITH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1987-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
