Tolstoy must explain to them that it is his wife who has authority over their land-holdings, and she will not help them. Stung by their negative reaction to him, Tolstoy becomes increasingly preoccupied with the problems of the poor. This leads to a number of conflicts with his wife, and then to a deep despondency, as the noted writer continues vainly to search for answers to the sufferings he sees around him.","popularity":0.1779,"poster_path":"/jcrH0sYhdakhIkFxXk4gbT7EFnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thiemann & Reinhardt","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1912-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Departure of a Great Old Man","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Ukhod velikogo startsa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Departure of a Grand Old Man","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Great Man Goes for a Walk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Shaternikov","original_name":"Vladimir Shaternikov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lev Tolstoy","credit_id":"5d3a54dae54d5d2533dd75ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2322810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Petrova-Zvantseva","original_name":"Olga Petrova-Zvantseva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sofja Andreevna","credit_id":"5d3a52b3ab684968b587b54f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Tamarov","original_name":"Mikhail Tamarov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Vladimir Chertkov","credit_id":"5d3a54f360c51d00138c8c22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizaveta Thiman","original_name":"Elizaveta Thiman","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Alexandra L'vovna","credit_id":"5d3a551660c51d00138c8cba","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizaveta Thiman","original_name":"Elizaveta Thiman","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c32c3a36847f82225f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul-Ernst Timan","original_name":"Paul-Ernst Timan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ef70abcaa508014c8b1bbb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083434,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph-Louis Mundwiller","original_name":"Joseph-Louis Mundwiller","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bb9566abdafc006167347b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551440,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandr Levitsky","original_name":"Aleksandr Levitsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bb955b68b7660061754cac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yakov Protazanov","original_name":"Yakov Protazanov","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/sMu7cbGFVamc3LShNpuGZZkTdJh.jpg","credit_id":"533bcd78c3a3684500001221","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372101,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isaak Teneromo","original_name":"Isaak Teneromo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bd5aab15d97b1a93c93a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Kavaleridze","original_name":"Іван Кавалерідзе","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/f3lSKdgKcbP0XduJPIREl4sN0gH.jpg","credit_id":"670bd5c4b15d97b1a93c93c4","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002136","wikidata_id":"Q3573937","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jcrH0sYhdakhIkFxXk4gbT7EFnl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":263464,"name":"leo tolstoy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
