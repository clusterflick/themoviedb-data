When a graduate student of Mideastern descent arrives in town to authenticate the world's largest stool, he unwittingly becomes the police chief's prime terrorist suspect. In creating this climate of fear, the chief acquires the power and the perks he's always dreamed of. And when he raises the town's alert level from brick to tangerine, panic ensues and common sense takes a holiday.","popularity":0.9468,"poster_path":"/dY9VGwGz6bsXDZI6Isvp4lJsbOa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrorists","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Roberts","original_name":"Ian Roberts","popularity":0.3087,"profile_path":"/jCc6zI4JceFAyeXIHXNR0blnzSe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Curtis Gorfurter","credit_id":"52fe4c34c3a36847f8222b91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Mantzoukas","original_name":"Jason Mantzoukas","popularity":1.2745,"profile_path":"/sCG3UAdoxCy39gMd9ILlAFJbApS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John Stevens","credit_id":"52fe4c34c3a36847f8222b95","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":200237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica St. Clair","original_name":"Jessica St. Clair","popularity":0.4933,"profile_path":"/lKIgq19oEx5ashQFF3QRYwMx0wz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jennifer Castle","credit_id":"52fe4c34c3a36847f8222b99","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Riggle","original_name":"Rob Riggle","popularity":1.5448,"profile_path":"/hQgOp8vWxl6KPZbqzKSSL4k6G1j.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Badger","credit_id":"52fe4c34c3a36847f8222ba9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Tisdale","original_name":"Bobby Tisdale","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/zZmqafzGsf3rNAfRgOPiOPrK3dC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Billy Castle","credit_id":"5a258f1b92514103290e21e6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Delaney","original_name":"Michael Delaney","popularity":0.3395,"profile_path":"/znR7SBIpdeLR2ejU7CNb0yqsIMq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Town Council Member","credit_id":"67b33c265dc988b1bb9f97f6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214718,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Martel","original_name":"Jay Martel","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c34c3a36847f8222ba5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214718,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Martel","original_name":"Jay Martel","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c34c3a36847f8222b9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0426597","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":855,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dY9VGwGz6bsXDZI6Isvp4lJsbOa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":629}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4210,"name":"panic"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
