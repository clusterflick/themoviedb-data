José's weary attitude is put to the test when he encounters Nathalie, a German tourist assisting a boatload of refugees she discovered landing on the Canary shores. One of those people, a Congolese man named Zola, is placed in an internment camp. Much to the objections of her husband Paul, Nathalie tries to help him escape. Yet Zola and his son Mamadou eventually find themselves in yet another precarious situation, in which they are dependent on nefarious smugglers.","popularity":0.3002,"poster_path":"/4GFfhGTywfnh2NnRYFOQevJYpuV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color of the Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álex González","original_name":"Álex González","popularity":2.0692,"profile_path":"/wSshBfOlhrRbHG7SRJp8nDeOtnD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"José","credit_id":"52fe4c37c3a36847f8223433","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Koundé","original_name":"Hubert Koundé","popularity":0.4499,"profile_path":"/nii46CtpR2AYPkl8fBKtbrffqQg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zola","credit_id":"52fe4c37c3a36847f8223437","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Poza","original_name":"Nathalie Poza","popularity":0.2282,"profile_path":"/ebG1AgIEi9WhUxCREmz4WiKoRtV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Carla","credit_id":"52fe4c37c3a36847f822343b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Timoteo","original_name":"Sabine Timoteo","popularity":0.328,"profile_path":"/84rbRaC1elfzmCxWo1KLXIZKdVF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nathalie","credit_id":"52fe4c37c3a36847f822343f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maggie Peren","original_name":"Maggie Peren","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/mJ2flOPm4lUwG660P1Las6sSMae.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c37c3a36847f822342f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maggie Peren","original_name":"Maggie Peren","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/mJ2flOPm4lUwG660P1Las6sSMae.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c37c3a36847f8223445","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1667190","wikidata_id":"Q43445461","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/4GFfhGTywfnh2NnRYFOQevJYpuV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":972,"name":"refugee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
