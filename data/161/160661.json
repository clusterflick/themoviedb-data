It follows a self-taught inventor from the serf class Nikishka, whose efforts to build a flying machine incite accusations of witchcraft. Nikishka and his beloved Fima are persecuted by the feudal lord Kurlyatev, who took their village in a petty land squabble. They’re rescued when Kurlyatev’s lands are taken by the Tsar in his autocratic campaign against the feudal system. Ivan puts Nikishka to work in his linen mill, where the young serf is coveted by Tsarina Maria Temryukovna, who the Tsar’s been ignoring in favor of his cupbearer Feodor. A series of harrowing intrigues wind a bloody dance through bedchamber, feast hall, cathedral and dungeon.","popularity":0.2215,"poster_path":"/owVGwMQtsPyIvDEBeAw4ZXbICGu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":410,"logo_path":"/eZlhJ4iCRM90hLB4RCC6RJEC9zr.png","name":"Sovkino","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
