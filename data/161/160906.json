Hearing he is from that hot-bed of crime, Chicago, Hester asks Donald to help her in a robbery she has planned. Thinking it a joke, he plays along; but Hester is serious, and hearing that she plans to rob Mr. Waller, the man who has cheated her father out of thousands of pounds, Donald agrees. A robbery at a pub is arranged, but the Bishop of Broadminster, an avid mystery fan, and his sister stumble into it. Playing detective the Bishop complicates matters and each side, the Bishop, the unscrupulous Waller, the gang Hester hires, and Hester and Donald, each get the upper hand along the way.","popularity":0.4876,"poster_path":"/mofQEQSxo35SuSiD64B9vapzGMm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Bishop's Misadventures","title":"The Bishop Misbehaves","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Gwenn","original_name":"Edmund Gwenn","popularity":0.3929,"profile_path":"/9xUiHCycn0WsxqiqFjq2fI40FpQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bishop","credit_id":"573b1aa89251411f20000528","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen O'Sullivan","original_name":"Maureen O'Sullivan","popularity":0.593,"profile_path":"/uA1Upl9u0TCVMjX7l7lgG44ap9N.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hester Grantham","credit_id":"573b1ab492514114df0006a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucile Watson","original_name":"Lucile Watson","popularity":0.1853,"profile_path":"/wNBcS1nGUNvKta1jHrnoSdxDUUZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lady Emily Lyons","credit_id":"573b1ad0c3a36829570006bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Owen","original_name":"Reginald Owen","popularity":0.5382,"profile_path":"/a7PEC3JPysPo4OoOqOIagDFZmNB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Guy Waller","credit_id":"573b1ae89251411f5200063f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dudley Digges","original_name":"Dudley Digges","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":"/1VCZYSSO7JTrwMLeI1NBp4d7o2x.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Red","credit_id":"573b1b1592514173c4002f1f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Foster","original_name":"Norman Foster","popularity":0.3898,"profile_path":"/g5sCObaSle1wspVOWsrj7wUgkMx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Donald Meadows","credit_id":"573b1b04c3a36806af003607","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Bond","original_name":"Lilian Bond","popularity":0.3336,"profile_path":"/voPHEjjoiRYuQnH4wmqPKgSIH94.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Millie Waller","credit_id":"5934e20bc3a3685a24029d87","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melville Cooper","original_name":"Melville Cooper","popularity":0.3013,"profile_path":"/qtrkqGRWA1kmud8NG3W44cpjIHc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Collins","credit_id":"573b1b3dc3a3682a3300072e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Greig","original_name":"Robert Greig","popularity":0.2177,"profile_path":"/4tOqP4ZmUPwM8MdElXPq01sy2u1.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Rosalind","credit_id":"62f3482685b105007df18a92","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles McNaughton","original_name":"Charles McNaughton","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":"/79YTS3ZRdQfHIqMBiMNUjQcajDG.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Frenchy Thorpe","credit_id":"587d9ce5c3a36849ff01e5c5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Etienne Girardot","original_name":"Etienne Girardot","popularity":0.161,"profile_path":"/c0bpLb5iOK4UXfv4jO1G6aS4ruD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Brooke","credit_id":"587d9ccf9251413ecb021b2f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan F.
