Ades's Asyla (the plural of \"Asylum,\" used in both its meanings, as a place of refuge and a scene of madness) is available only in the video format, which is sonically quite good and visually striking. It is energetic music, with a lot of percussion, including one piece that looks like a tomato juice can, and one movement that annotator Andrew Porter describes as \"a sort of Rite of Spring cum disco.\" A video interview of Rattle is a fine bonus. --Joe McLellan","popularity":0.1119,"poster_path":"/7lAh0BuWAMHqQfQUvPlpDAeOUik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":194,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mahler's 5th Symphony","title":"Mahler Symphony No. 5 & Ades Asyla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Rattle","original_name":"Simon Rattle","popularity":0.2831,"profile_path":"/erFlB9B08lVMhEj70bLUpkr28iA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff90fc00c1255003ef04502","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2897270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","original_name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff90fc891f0ea003f94f89e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5379085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Coles","original_name":"Bob Coles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680154cfe4753425efad1007","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1899238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1558,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7lAh0BuWAMHqQfQUvPlpDAeOUik.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1039},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hqKHYSwLzI0QefhbhnesrID7fHx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
