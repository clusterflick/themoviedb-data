They escape from the fires, looting and violence in South Central, only to realize that the real drama is right under their own roof. Personalities clash and bodies merge as this all-night party reaches its climax. Strangers become friends, and enemies become lovers, when each one confronts their fears, desires, addictions and dreams.","popularity":0.1753,"poster_path":"/z3EjViDPHSGj4dTyIvOCafng1JM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indican Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They escaped from reality and found each other.","title":"Come Together","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Jeder mit Jedem - Freie Fahrt f√ºr einen Tag","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Gomez","original_name":"Vanessa Gomez","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/vN01yEDXYgGnY0D9FeSnuwcZT1Y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Angelina Navarro","credit_id":"52fe4c38c3a36847f82238ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Sullivan","original_name":"Marisa Sullivan","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Susan McMillan","credit_id":"52fe4c38c3a36847f82238df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Ryan","original_name":"Spencer Ryan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Jeremy Weinstein","credit_id":"52fe4c38c3a36847f82238f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaimie Beebe","original_name":"Jaimie Beebe","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Girl In The Window","credit_id":"52fe4c38c3a36847f82238db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cooney Horvath","original_name":"Cooney Horvath","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Seth Hayes","credit_id":"52fe4c38c3a36847f82238e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jen Kim","original_name":"Jen Kim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lulu Chen","credit_id":"52fe4c38c3a36847f82238e7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles B.
