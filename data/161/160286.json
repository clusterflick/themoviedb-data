Eventually, a child is born but, to Casey's dismay, it's a girl, not a boy. His wife suggests they try again several more times but each time, it's still another girl. Casey is depressed but his pals tell him that in spite of everything, they still make a powerful baseball team. Casey likes the idea and accepts. However, the day of the big game, he is nervous that one of them will strike out and attempts to make the last home run himself disguised as one of his own daughters.","popularity":0.5,"poster_path":"/nbiJnTAk26grqs1H3ULYQNhvJi8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Casey wants one son to carry on his fame, instead has nine daughters who can play the game.","title":"Casey Bats Again","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"551d846f9251413743000846","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Wallace","original_name":"Oliver Wallace","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137f91f9369a20043fd5979","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Kinney","original_name":"Jack Kinney","popularity":0.3626,"profile_path":"/4wFzg3PdcrB1wPnCl5sj4KuS2Mk.jpg","credit_id":"551d8428c3a3683a1c000825","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150040,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Brice Mack","original_name":"Brice Mack","popularity":0.1097,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551d8445925141374800079e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Kinney","original_name":"Dick Kinney","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551d8452c3a3683a140007f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"551d848992514137480007a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0046835","wikidata_id":"Q2940965","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":887,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/btE5ll8hHcyxh8nVeqN8WAsHZiO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1577}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nbiJnTAk26grqs1H3ULYQNhvJi8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1978},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ayoYMBdvokSQgqt0mzbj6uWx4AH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5600,"name":"daughter"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":159201,"name":"baseball player"},{"id":243521,"name":"baseball game"},{"id":248306,"name":"daughters"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
