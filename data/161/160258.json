Increasingly unhappy, she decides to return to her village. But not even in her childhood home does she find the serenity she longs for. On the contrary, she is forced to face up to painful childhood memories and come to terms once more with her mourning over her father’s death. The situation is made even more distressing after she meets a strange couple who live nearby: the mother keeps her child blindfolded and tied to a chair in the stall.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/p3Avc1OkVTl1JzR0ZsMURPVCQ1J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2007-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jing Tu - Burning","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xu Yilin","original_name":"Xu Yilin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c2dc3a36847f8221699","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dai Hui","original_name":"Dai Hui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c2dc3a36847f822169d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ding Libo","original_name":"Ding Libo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c2dc3a36847f82216a1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142359,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shen Yanjun","original_name":"Shen Yanjun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c2dc3a36847f822168f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142363,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dong Weiqi","original_name":"Dong Weiqi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c2dc3a36847f8221695","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bai  Fujian","original_name":"Bai  Fujian","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c2dc3a36847f8221689","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142359,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shen Yanjun","original_name":"Shen Yanjun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c2dc3a36847f8221683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3Avc1OkVTl1JzR0ZsMURPVCQ1J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
