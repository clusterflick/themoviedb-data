It follows her up the stairs and into her apartment. She tries slamming the door on it, getting rid of it with a vacuum cleaner, and dumping it in someone else's shopping cart. But the cloud doesn't leave her, until she meets a young man who has his own sunshine. Is love the way she's going to get rid of her cloud? Or will change have to happen from within?","popularity":0.0372,"poster_path":"/45sziHApw5RSw3fkWkpjecCnBJ0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cloud Cover","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisbeth Svärling","original_name":"Lisbeth Svärling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbe8d3292514151cafa9f6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0290534","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45sziHApw5RSw3fkWkpjecCnBJ0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
