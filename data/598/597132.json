Cutting edge R&D is the norm for Formula One teams and their drivers between the end of one season and the beginning of the next. In this groundbreaking documentary we follow the F1 McLaren team and its star driver Ayrton Senna from the Chequered Flag at end of the last race in 1990 in Adelaide for the Australian GP - to the Green Light start of the first race of 1991 in Phoenix, Arizona for the US Grand Prix. A unique behind-the-scenes look at F1, this video shows the state-of-the-art McLaren headquarters in Woking, England, rigorous testing in Estoril, Portugal, followed by Barcelona, Spain and finally Suzuka, Japan. Bonus footage includes a close up and personal look at Senna during his offseason in his homeland, Brazil, and finally to the US for the start of the new Grand Prix season.","popularity":0.5424,"poster_path":"/jfb6zYcSANPSx2nDy0a6u3FYgrh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bedford
