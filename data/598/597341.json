Thirty-five years later, the men who serviced the aeroplanes are still meeting up for their annual dinner. Now settled into civilian jobs - dentist, baker, taxi-driver, insurance salesman - and with children and grandchildren, they bemoan the decay of traditional Japanese values. Hard liquor is imbibed, toasts raised to the memory of the heroic dead, and old rivalries resurface. The survivors' dissatisfaction with post-war life comes to a head when, in a moment of drunken inspiration, Tokkotai the airline pilot decides on a symbolic gesture to show that the kamikaze spirit lives on.","popularity":0.6452,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kamikaze Ground Staff Reunion Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sallis","original_name":"Peter Sallis","popularity":0.4544,"profile_path":"/tB7r7LxdNEn7RfRs837V3REfgF4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shushin","credit_id":"5cc05fa29251412ba1f33ffa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":199070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Blythe","original_name":"John Blythe","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/sjvgcdl05WCWyG5yQwMOfLMgQql.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kamiwashi","credit_id":"5cc05fb3c3a3681458849969","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Goodwin","original_name":"Harold Goodwin","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/8ftr5oZzRMGdZic5vyudb9qBSkD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shimpu","credit_id":"5cc05fbe0e0a266b96fc7a2e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Henderson","original_name":"Don Henderson","popularity":0.258,"profile_path":"/93Zcpxng8e4aACOgsjU5i727oQc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tokkotai","credit_id":"5cc05fd49251417d39fce653","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Vernon","original_name":"Richard Vernon","popularity":0.5354,"profile_path":"/uSFGSsK4MZgL7G0YRinZeSQYRxY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Makato","credit_id":"5cc05fe4c3a3686b0b923683","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Prior","original_name":"Patricia Prior","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Miss Tomishita","credit_id":"5cc060040e0a266b96fc7a60","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1410872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Maddox","original_name":"Mary Maddox","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Girl Singer","credit_id":"5cc060170e0a266b96fc7a70","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Penfold","original_name":"Mark Penfold","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/bLF3SN8f96yXkZJkpLBwGW436C9.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Co-Pilot","credit_id":"5cc060279251410671fcb6cf","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295964,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stewart Parker","original_name":"Stewart Parker","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc05f2e92514108d101f45a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baz Taylor","original_name":"Baz Taylor","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc05f1ec3a36809ab82761e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
