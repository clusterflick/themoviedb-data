However, they say those times were like Utopia. They even say they are sorry for not being able to present youths today with the same experiences. They were known as 'work animals' because all they did was work, but they proudly say did that to feel accomplished at the end of the day. It was a world where the working environment was decent. However, once the jobs that they spent their whole youths on disappeared, they reminisced over them in silence. They are trying to return the favor to their families now. This documentary is the confession from our fathers who devoted everything to work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of My Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
