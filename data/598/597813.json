A virgin, he shows no interest in sex, and is cruelly scorned by an aggressive female neighbour when he rebuffs her advances. He lives with his mother, an overbearing woman who mocks him for being wet. But Stephen has a secret – he likes to wear women’s clothing. When his horrified mother finds out, she takes him to meet a fellow cross-dresser to ‘solve’ the problem. But the meeting ends unexpectedly, when the other man realises that Stephen is not transvestite, but transsexual.","popularity":0.9519,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1979-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Even Solomon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Play for Today: Even Solomon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2229932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Henley","original_name":"Paul Henley","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Stephen Piper","credit_id":"5cc2ede5c3a3686b0b969d06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Farr","original_name":"Derek Farr","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/szQ3hFOuYFyr3XkHzLCCpNIUzMu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5cc2edfa0e0a264d93edc070","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Kay","original_name":"Sylvia Kay","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/pHabGl9J0d1DbsW2QoAmrTjOC7k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sylvia","credit_id":"5cc2ee079251413a1cf46fb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1339085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Hall","original_name":"Catherine Hall","popularity":0.3548,"profile_path":"/x6oqAAP6dgtO1y7EGScg0MijLmC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"5cc2ee1ec3a3686b0b969d22","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1634359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Healey","original_name":"James Healey","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/6v4cmxjRzDkAf0rds17f0xP3GA5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Corrigan","credit_id":"5cc2ee409251417d3900c0ac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Purchase","original_name":"Bruce Purchase","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":"/lO3T0aDL9n0GEBwaiOft8AmWAd6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"5cc2ee4e9251412577ff4379","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Douglas","original_name":"Colin Douglas","popularity":0.3277,"profile_path":"/jvTsM12inqJgJQeN0YPGiKKpUHF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr Leslie","credit_id":"5cc2ee5f9251412577ff437e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Rouse","original_name":"Simon Rouse","popularity":0.1984,"profile_path":"/80SGEP1EQHAuotHgcZy5fwXrblR.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Blakeney","credit_id":"5cc2ee740e0a26105afa8d21","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Simons","original_name":"William Simons","popularity":0.3353,"profile_path":"/rAHnJO56LP8GAoQ6whhpgDLtz3j.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"5cc2ee850e0a26105afa8d34","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1111026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Watkins","original_name":"Sally Watkins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Lorraine","credit_id":"5cc2ee97c3a368145888c5c9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2297239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Taylor","original_name":"Andrew Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc2edc1925141593ef4687b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Bamford","original_name":"Roger Bamford","popularity":0.1277,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc2ed90925141593ef46809","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1250674,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Head","original_name":"Anne Head","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7eb7c6dd926a0038958e2a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0771126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5fAY2ZK9jo5vXi3W63hO68w9ha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
