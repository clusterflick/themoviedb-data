At 80 years young (and currently recording another album), Gordon Lightfoot continues to entertain and enlighten.

the hedonistic '70s.","popularity":1.1125,"poster_path":"/xZLb1KJ991sLUlYAIAMLelUS2Pk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gordon
