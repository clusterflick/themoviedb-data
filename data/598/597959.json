It’s well paced, well played, well sung. Jonas Kaufmann is an ideal Tito. His voice is not only beautiful and flexible, it’s also ample, retaining warmth and sweetness when he sings out. The character of Tito is too good to be true, but Kaufmann makes him intense, noble, and beliveable. Vesselina Kasarova is riviting as Sesto. Her voice is gorgeous and multi-colored, her technique exquisite, her immersion in the role complete.","popularity":0.3371,"poster_path":"/vSRtHcoq6YoDTjPuzURh4Aw2hBI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14259,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Clemenza di Tito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tito Vespasiano","credit_id":"5cc38254c3a3681e6b821d11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Mei","original_name":"Eva Mei","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Vitellia","credit_id":"5cc3858a9251413a1cf571a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vesselina Kasarova","original_name":"Vesselina Kasarova","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/rkyOqckwAYW3rHVGBj92jwxuhCd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sesto","credit_id":"5cc385ae925141097d0162a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malin Hartelius","original_name":"Malin Hartelius","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/f2oag0FivnRM7hQelpQI94ORo8k.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Servilia","credit_id":"5cc385d79251412577004a96","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliana Nikiteanu","original_name":"Liliana Nikiteanu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Annio","credit_id":"5cc385ef9251412ba1f82bdb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Groissböck","original_name":"Günther Groissböck","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/dEynH6fOflbYc0wwO3cnZ8CtMZa.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Publio","credit_id":"5cc386069251415cd2f587ae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Welser-Möst","original_name":"Franz Welser-Möst","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5cc3861f9251413a1cf57212","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Miller","original_name":"Jonathan Miller","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/jBhQSQavORk3DZzn5mDMgtxWjW3.jpg","credit_id":"64494b3ef2cf2504e2adec3e","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"5cc384680e0a261a55fc32d8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2297661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Caterino Tommaso Mazzolá","original_name":"Caterino Tommaso Mazzolá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc384869251412577004890","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655135,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pietro Metastasio","original_name":"Pietro Metastasio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc384cc0e0a2619d6f2fa16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Breisach","original_name":"Felix Breisach","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/cg2Htu3AOmFp61XSKBOcycoXgIr.jpg","credit_id":"5cc38556c3a3681e6b822154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14792798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dDr9nlGK9RgnaHO2pPdrPrp4f02.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vSRtHcoq6YoDTjPuzURh4Aw2hBI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":7881,"name":"mozart"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
