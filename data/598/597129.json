The state of flux between both type of events is reflected in the places and actions of the inhabitants making the island’s extremes seem familiar: the air is riven with waiting and suspension.  The island of Funafuti, in the archipelago of Tuvalu, for some years now has become the stage for a unique phenomenon. Due to the unnatural warming of the sea, saltwater seeps into the subsoil bubbling up through the porous terrain provoking floods which put the future of life on this island at risk.","popularity":0.0796,"poster_path":"/4EGbggOzJweb36gzKx1CpBK4Oys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2019-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Which Is to Come Is Just a Promise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flatform","original_name":"Flatform","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbf03a592514151cafb2d0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flatform","original_name":"Flatform","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3d82925141048125b106","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flatform","original_name":"Flatform","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3d91c3a36836c1d9bb52","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267783,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Baumfield","original_name":"Simon Baumfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3da9c3a36836bbd9d90a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2302816,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jess Charlton","original_name":"Jess Charlton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3dbb0e0a262fbfffb87c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1645855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wiebe de Boer","original_name":"Wiebe de Boer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3dc7c3a36836add9cf87","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23582,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reinier van Brummelen","original_name":"Reinier van Brummelen","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3de9925141046125b8a6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Compositing Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23582,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reinier van Brummelen","original_name":"Reinier van Brummelen","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3e00925141045d25d1fd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flatform","original_name":"Flatform","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb3e0b925141046125b962","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10270138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4EGbggOzJweb36gzKx1CpBK4Oys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Directors’ Fortnight","release_date":"2019-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
