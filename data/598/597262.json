He served in the U.S. Marines and later in life, befriended the Dalai Lama. He made a lot of money in finance, but gave most of it away. And while he’s best known as the proprietor of the famous Grace Family Vineyards in California’s Napa Valley, he is a recovering alcoholic who doesn’t drink. This film profiles the octogenarian, who lives by altruism, is a font of wit and wisdom, and can teach all of us a few things about forging a rich existence during our time on Earth.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Take the Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Grace","original_name":"Ann Grace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cc00284c3a3687f8f89c359","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Grace","original_name":"Dick Grace","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cc002a3c3a368596a82454c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Holbrooke","original_name":"David Holbrooke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc002c80e0a261a55f659d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Holbrooke","original_name":"David Holbrooke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc002e80e0a261a55f659dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent DeLuca","original_name":"Vincent DeLuca","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc003140e0a266b96fc150f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luke Sullivant","original_name":"Luke Sullivant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc003560e0a2654e9f1f7f5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295787,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ethan Downing","original_name":"Ethan Downing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc003870e0a26105af5fd10","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295788,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anthony Holbrooke","original_name":"Anthony Holbrooke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc003a7c3a368776c8aae17","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295789,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wiley Holbrooke","original_name":"Wiley Holbrooke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc003c5c3a3687f8f89c430","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karee Maxson","original_name":"Karee Maxson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc003e392514108d101986f","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295787,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ethan Downing","original_name":"Ethan Downing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc004119251412577fb1b6f","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295791,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Darshan Kembhavi","original_name":"Darshan Kembhavi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc004449251412577fb1b9c","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karee Maxson","original_name":"Karee Maxson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc0046a9251412ba1f2ddb6","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295792,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dolores Delgado","original_name":"Dolores Delgado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc004d49251412ba1f2ddf0","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9276900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
