These ancient movie temples - huge cathedrals or tiny chapels - still stand out from present-day too common buildings. If this movie is a journey into the past, revealing a silent world that is lost at the very core of modern cities, it also sends all moviegoers back to their own memories and to their intimate relationship with the passing of time. Each deserted theater, each facade of old movie houses, keeps its very own untouched emotional power - NOWADAYS.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/jc41RtLMJtCGyNGVm5zTuWgVd1N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prochainement nulle part","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Guiguet","original_name":"Jean-Claude Guiguet","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"5dd835ad3faba00013f9ae0e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2255045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Pavelek","original_name":"Bernard Pavelek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbe6ae1c3a368092a81ab12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5928254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jc41RtLMJtCGyNGVm5zTuWgVd1N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
