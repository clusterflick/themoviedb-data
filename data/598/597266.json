Katie Lee was a spitfire activist, river goddess and folk-singing warrior for wild places. And when she passed away at the age of 98, she left behind a legacy as big as the Grand Canyon. This short film pays homage to a life shaped by redrock canyons, sinuous rivers, monkey-wrenching mischief and uninhibited passion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Felt Soul Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Travis Rummel","original_name":"Travis Rummel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccedcea0e0a262d7bff476d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2305381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Knight","original_name":"Ben Knight","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccedcd892514104812bb4d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
