In this film, Evandro Scorsin turns the cameras on himself as he deals with the dilemmas of the passing of time and the imposition of adulthood. In an exercise in autofiction where cinema and life merge, the film is also a cinematic love letter to the beloved masters (especially Nicholas Ray). Coming and going between two countries and times, it records the vertigo of displacement and the reinventions inherent to an immigrant experience.","popularity":0.2558,"poster_path":"/vLnHtEqmQ9tCiBBY1BRZ9CLf0xP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32820,"logo_path":null,"name":"O
