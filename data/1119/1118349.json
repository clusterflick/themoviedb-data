Both men emerged from the turmoil of the Habsburg Empire in its closing days with the idea of analyzing language and purging it with critical intent, believing that in the analysis and purification of language lies the greatest hope that we have.  They never met and might never have fully understood one another, because while the nature of their genius they found themselves alone breaking new ground of the very frontiers of their respective disciplines.  But their work springs from the same soil and shares a common ethical purpose, so that their ideas and methods echo and illuminate those of each other to a remarkable degree.","popularity":0.2435,"poster_path":"/qRX3yJqEj2qvdNJVjmx5hdGjukf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegro Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Language Of The New Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4030283,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Nupen","original_name":"Michael Nupen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6449449e49756004e6df5c4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","original_name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/wgESY3384x00YZgyopCEt05695T.jpg","credit_id":"644943c26a222702fcd18acd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1464929,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnold Schönberg","original_name":"Arnold Schönberg","popularity":0.0746,"profile_path":"/kqWx1UUCOTf34NZhvuc1sdK9BPg.jpg","credit_id":"6449442b7f2d4a04dd0b58f7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Nupen","original_name":"Christopher Nupen","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6449437b05a53305661b7365","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613645,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Geoff Mulligan","original_name":"Geoff Mulligan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644945657f2d4a04890b5900","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932034,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles Lagus","original_name":"Charles Lagus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64494577f2cf2504b8adeb84","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4030291,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"john crump","original_name":"john crump","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6449458d6a222704ccd18e26","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4030301,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"michael gray","original_name":"michael gray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644946242fdec60573a10eeb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4030294,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"fred bagwell","original_name":"fred bagwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644945a36a222704a0d18c3c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2390719,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Dykes","original_name":"Alan Dykes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6449464505a53305661b744d","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qRX3yJqEj2qvdNJVjmx5hdGjukf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":490,"name":"philosophy"},{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":291137,"name":"modern classical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Language Of The New Music - Documentary about Wittgenstein and Schoenberg, 1985","key":"DRI_ZSh6iF4","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-25T14:00:00.000Z","id":"644946f87f2d4a05110b59d7"}]}}}
