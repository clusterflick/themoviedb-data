Irén, Éva and Ágnes - all between 90 and 100 years old - were once part of the early modern dance movement in Hungary.  Taking the role of a dance student and dialogue partner Boglárka retraces how each of the elderly dancers transformed their lives and movement practices in order to survive the major socio-political changes of the last century.  The film takes us into a personal and bodily encounter with three very different personalities and their relation to their past and present. Returning to the stage and performing in their private rooms, Irén, Éva and Ágnes reveal us an incredible richness of experience stored in their bodies.  A choreography of memories.","popularity":0.1032,"poster_path":"/piCwC0Gxo0Ht62VnoWF94SAqfJE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whole Wall Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Movement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva E.
