The red supergiant Betelgeuse is about to die and the gamma rays from the supernova could destroy life on Earth. Scientists are divided, the rumour is unstoppable. Sarah, a Belgian astrophysicist based in New Mexico, is spending her days reviewing calculations and controversial theories about the star. Since her colleague and lover Elliot died in a car crash, she is stuck alone inside her home, and suffers violent panic attacks every time she tries to step outdoors. She decides that the time has come to end this impossible situation. But a ghost from the past persuades her to do one last thing: if she must kill herself, to do it in the middle of the mountains, at the place where she first met her lost love. Finally the day comes. Betelgeuse is ready to explode and Sarah is ready to leave the house. Maybe this is the beginning.","popularity":0.1918,"poster_path":"/n0wUrGyMw9WiZ3hyRG96DUSg9N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indieproduction","origin_country":"US"},{"id":128955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rien Ã  voir production","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":45732,"logo_path":"/Lp13ZZW7Gc3syx1J2DdqAoU0dT.png","name":"Savage Productions","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Betelgeuse","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lubna Azabal","original_name":"Lubna Azabal","popularity":0.7619,"profile_path":"/qjsoXqKJPnmoMs1eyeTLBKKShYQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"6448c2a62fdec60540a0db29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Flanders","original_name":"John Flanders","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":"/kdOw4CDqMZ0x3xf4NVGkDKootiS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"6448c2c0f2cf250536adb546","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292601,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruno Tracq","original_name":"Bruno Tracq","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6448c2fa6a222704ccd156bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Snowdon","original_name":"Peter Snowdon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6448c3180f21c60498280a01","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292601,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruno Tracq","original_name":"Bruno Tracq","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6448c32449756004e6df2697","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1398636,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Keville","original_name":"John Keville","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/bKSybRShQ8T97jhGNwgZleEowcT.jpg","credit_id":"6765b247330bce6ec990df75","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4946878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0wUrGyMw9WiZ3hyRG96DUSg9N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1413}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Betelgeuse Trailer","key":"f-eEagS1h5o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-06-09T15:19:42.000Z","id":"6448c42f4975600512df268e"}]}}}
