It pinpoints the ‘detachment’ which means expressing one’s own critical attitude towards the kind of architecture that refuses to accept any ‘vital’ aspects but reduces itself to a ‘monumental structure’ that is not able to contain the dynamics of human relationships.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/x3nbhmiLD0I8084czkECPEMaSq6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monumentalism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ugo La Pietra","original_name":"Ugo La Pietra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64497a950f21c60498284de4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Livietti","original_name":"Mario Livietti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64497aa00f21c6046e284d3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x3nbhmiLD0I8084czkECPEMaSq6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
