An  unlikely encounter that sparks an unexpected connection  happens when Yna walks towards the solemnity of the  cemetery, the flicker of a candle and the fragrance of  flowers gives birth to a new connection, one that transcends  life and death. An unknowingly deep relationship was  created as Yna bought sampaguita and met Josefina. As  Josefina walks towards the cemetery clutching a well-lit  candle and creating an intimate conversation. Days  passed, and through their stories and struggles - a  connection was forged. One day, Yna goes to the  cemetery crying accompanied by Josefina as they give  their warmest comfort towards each other. As they lit  the candles in-front of the graves, a secret will unfold  and a revelation will finally be unveiled.","popularity":0.1031,"poster_path":"/rxIpxiAfc95FO9dmQwDDRGLMGGi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halik Araw
