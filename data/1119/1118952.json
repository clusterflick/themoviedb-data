The bad news is pension systems are busting worldwide. With extensive old age poverty as a result. In The Netherlands the system is still solid, though inflation is hitting many pensioners here as well.  Your 100-year life shows how even the richest countries have been brought to this point. Yet, there are genuine grounds for hope. It’s not too late yet. Providing we rethink the concept of retirement in general, and of old age, the quality of life as a pensioner and financing it in particular. It will make your hundredth anniversary something to celebrate.","popularity":0.2886,"poster_path":"/gjnO6ihFE7SCD1m7jOD7vKd6jCE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103420,"logo_path":null,"name":"TVF International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if you live to 100?","title":"Your Hundred Year Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Váš stoletý život","type":"festivalový název"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David C.
