Intended as an investigation of the footage as visual, experiential, and cultural document. In the USA this footage is both notorious and invisible; seldom actually seen, it is very well known; when seen, it remains opaque. This work is intended to add a level of \"transparency\" to original. It is set to Jajouka music in order to bring to the foreground the ritual aspects of this visual, mechanical; and media historical event. For some reason I had a memory of that footage being black and white.","popularity":0.0598,"poster_path":"/nTo7O693ZeuX7JUSdrPbxbeTRXa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Zapruder Footage: An Investigation of Consensual Hallucination","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Sanborn","original_name":"Keith Sanborn","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6449ec37a76ac5049db38b27","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Sanborn","original_name":"Keith Sanborn","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6449ec47e72fe805377ed376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6345680","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nTo7O693ZeuX7JUSdrPbxbeTRXa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
