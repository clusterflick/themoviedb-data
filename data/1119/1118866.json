Having fled political repression in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the family tries to rebuild a peaceful life in Montreal, in spite of the constant threat of deportation. Between ghosts from the past, hopes for the future, a complex legal maze and seemingly endless trial, the film delves into the struggle of the Nkunga Mbala family to remain in Canada. Offering unprecedented access to their hearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board, the film unveils the opaque process of claiming asylum in Canada.","popularity":0.3217,"poster_path":"/jwZc7Y48hJgjgK2iLY9NDzHcTb6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38201,"logo_path":"/fYolDp6ajIDXiMsXYXHXcWyNIYe.png","name":"Colonelle Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":44810,"logo_path":"/fwnOlu3T5VrgVWruS7rck7tWprC.png","name":"Les Films du 3 Mars","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A family's struggle in seeking asylum to remain in Canada","title":"The Hearing","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Hearing","type":"Anglais"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4032240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peggy Nkunga Ndona","original_name":"Peggy Nkunga Ndona","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/8PBCcyQlYyJ8OgbdDzZV7ZMXELP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b08dd9d236e600e238446d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4161130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Mbala Kapela","original_name":"Simon Mbala Kapela","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b08e27ba48020105dcc93e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4552032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adoration Francis Nkunga Mbala","original_name":"Adoration Francis Nkunga Mbala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d7a5dda57d4301308a3e02","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4552033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Consolation Sophie Nkunga Mbala","original_name":"Consolation Sophie Nkunga Mbala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d7a5f1a57d43017c8a5c4c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4552034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Crédo Nkunga Mbala","original_name":"Benjamin Crédo Nkunga Mbala","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d7a601ce9e910163b77af6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3526371,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Bélanger","original_name":"Bruno Bélanger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552911dfd6fa100e1e41d33","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832534,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Fernández","original_name":"Juan Fernández","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552916d67b61345dbbf8762","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Glauco Bermudez","original_name":"Glauco Bermudez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65529190ea84c71094febb8f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Portillo","original_name":"René Portillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65529155ea84c71093ff1264","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384940,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marie-Pierre Grenier","original_name":"Marie-Pierre Grenier","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/dR3kJUpbZ04N7dWgl23jJpeb4bc.jpg","credit_id":"65529104ea84c71096db987a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2136235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émilie B.
