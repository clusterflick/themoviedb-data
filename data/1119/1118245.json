Shot from different perspectives, with much attention paid to the technology and the mechanics of the rotating blades. Several men try to fly the helicopter, but their attempts fail, and the helicopter remains on the ground the whole time. At the end, there is a small “accident”, as a part of the tailpiece breaks off. This footage was shot so that the test flights could be analyzed later.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/w6tw8OjGraHNO6qDVekz8ou2AXa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1926-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Helicopter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6tw8OjGraHNO6qDVekz8ou2AXa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
