The film takes us on a journey into Ling Nah’s inner world—her memories, dreams and angels, and her fascination with black-and-white media, drawing charcoal and the city’s transitional spaces. The film explores her practice over the last 15 years and hints at the possible new directions in her art career. It highlights Ling Nah’s courage to pursue her dream to be an artist, the choices and sacrifices she has made, as well as the challenges of being a woman artist in Singapore and her regrets in this journey. The film’s dream-like form mixes documentary, fiction and animation. It blurs the boundaries between us, Ling Nah’s art and her deepest being. Ultimately, it celebrates our dreams—and reassures us that dreams do come true if persevered.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/iJdRki8Noku9ezisgvL5HAUqjEH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2017-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreaming in Black and White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"幻境黑白","type":"Chinese Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"Dreaming in Black and White: Portrait of a Singapore Artist – Tang Ling Nah","type":"Full Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4029635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tang Ling Nah","original_name":"Tang Ling Nah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6448bf2ff2cf250536adb348","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1589540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lei Yuan Bin","original_name":"Lei Yuan Bin","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":"/8FwwI2qWIKb4m34Z3PAfGrvBaVG.jpg","credit_id":"6448bf1d2fdec60514a0d883","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4029635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tang Ling Nah","original_name":"Tang Ling Nah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6448c06c49756004badf254c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1589540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lei Yuan Bin","original_name":"Lei Yuan Bin","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":"/8FwwI2qWIKb4m34Z3PAfGrvBaVG.jpg","credit_id":"6448c0630f21c604ec280a64","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"dreaminginblackandwhitefilmsg","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2047,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iJdRki8Noku9ezisgvL5HAUqjEH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":283800,"name":"docufiction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Singapore Chinese Film Festival","release_date":"2018-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dreaming in Black and White Official Trailer","key":"iIFcEmHuyAo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-11T13:16:38.000Z","id":"6448be886a222704a0d151bb"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dreaming in Black and White - A Film about a Singapore Artist (Official Teaser 2)","key":"hn0BPjuRaOw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-06T14:43:48.000Z","id":"6448bec37f2d4a05110b221c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dreaming in Black and White - A Film about a Singapore Artist (Official Teaser 1)","key":"NtoIntElZck","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-12-25T18:22:02.000Z","id":"6448be9b2fdec60540a0d8fd"}]}}}
