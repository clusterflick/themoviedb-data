This is followed by an uninterrupted series of animated images, a kind of fleeting moment or painting that continually transforms, until it becomes a copy of Edouard Manet’s Olympia (1863).  The second part begins with the title’s next part, which disappears just like the first one, setting in motion a reverse movement, from left to right, where images related to the first part, out of focus or from other points of view, arrive, ending with the reproduction of Félix Vallotton’s La Blanche et la Noire (1913).","popularity":0.0734,"poster_path":"/qdqXvygVRculhjb82Vo45NTBPLZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio GDS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":82153,"logo_path":"/mNEYX9oxFny6OOyb8083AKPbH8U.png","name":"Miyu Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two long visual sentences answering each other.","title":"From One Painting To Another","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","title":"D’une Peinture à l’autre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Schwizgebel","original_name":"Georges Schwizgebel","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/9hixdcBCCwqYtfc1l7rF7N6WpZa.jpg","credit_id":"6449a721a39d0b042d2449ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28101180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wH7eVJsY5uGJRDxiTiWSqxr24rW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1361}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qdqXvygVRculhjb82Vo45NTBPLZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/r2CbwWUuYpMhPSGK088U7i5K0hS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/slA7w80n17wLAYhLdfgQFtz7jTP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/50cHBdzKCtsXhu0Kb4l2YIn7zXI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ck3FBHMPSsbe8FT6RfiuFCaYvUt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1c34skT1JfNhGXpmfJMZiQn8uYs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1199},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xb7n5CYddtP4fIIF43fW6RCjOrQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1341,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/aE1V9BH00ttVhKomqIAiYbkq7x5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rvxkrmLwMVxeywzg2fV6jBL76ex.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/53eFz8oQj4XQEjF9Wx7OoeuDlnu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2sDFFOQV1UykNqkb1wueFWoCOjt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4TsVldM4fywiq46rEW27Vveh8KA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8XDGY8sLZanRRlnkMQqg16us0P6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
