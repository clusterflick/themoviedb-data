Multiracial Identity explores the social, political, and religious impact of the multiracial movement. Different racial and cultural groups see multiracialism differently. For some Whites multiracialism represents the pollution of the White race. For some Blacks it represents an attempt to escape Blackness. And for some Asians, Latinos, and Arabs, multiracialism can be seen as ill equipped to perpetuate cultural traditions and therefore represents the dilution of the culture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Multiracial Identity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4030633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Chinhema","original_name":"Brian Chinhema","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644978e1eb0932051b7b4301","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1597050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
