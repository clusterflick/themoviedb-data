RRRWGHHRW! RRRWGHHRW!\" How far will you go to reach your dreams? Let Eloy tell you how. Eloy Macapagat is a grade school student who dreams of becoming an artist someday. You'll most probably see him acting inside his room with movie posters. So, when given the chance to act in a school play as a carabao, Eloy  accepted the role. That's his chance!  But how will he become a carabao if he does not know how to act like one? Mang Kiko, a farmer, and Papa P., a carabao, got Eloy's back. Mang Kiko taught Eloy how to act and be like Papa P. Soon, the farmer, the carabao, and  the carabao-wannabe eventually grew fond of each other on the mud and green lands. Yet, how far will Eloy really go to reach his dreams? Will he continue to bond with Mang Kiko and  Papa P. after his school play? Here, let Eloy tell you—\"RRRWGHHRW! RRRWGHHRW!
