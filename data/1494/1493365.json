They were calculated and displayed with an interactive graphic screen of the Siemens Research Laboratory, Munich, in connection with a digital data processing unit. The unit allowed interactive operation – work under interactive visual control; a keyboard was used to change the elements interactively – for example, by specifying the number of picture elements, the angle of intersection, the speed of the sequence, and so on. The movement could be stopped for a static image at any time.  Herbert W. Franke created also a longer film ROTATIONEN with background electronic music by his friend and acoustic artist Peter Scheffler. Scheffler had invented a “sound robot”, this machine detected and processed the cosmic radiation from outer space into tonal effects in the 1970s.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rotationen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5307922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert W.
