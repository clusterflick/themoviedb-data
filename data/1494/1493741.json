Let it all come back! Except, there is something that doesn’t need to resurface again. Never. Welcome to the 70s is a musical with a serious twist. It is a one-taker without any hidden cuts. Even in it’s serious tensions, it doesn’t preach but rather gives the audience facts and food for thought. Though the spot taps to the overruling of the Roe v. Wade and has an “American perspective” the message is universal. It reminds everyone to stay alert and to remember, that the only abortions possible to be banned are the safe ones. The spot is made by recycling old materials, renting props and buying new only what was necessary. It is made with a small budget with people passionate about the cause and the need to make a change.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/f0BYeT6jY53PPhIeh5IlmNhLx04.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to the 70s!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Häuser","original_name":"Jenny Häuser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6842f0f101b2931f3df2cc88","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3811991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gretta-Garoliina Sammalniemi","original_name":"Gretta-Garoliina Sammalniemi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842f09f79b0fc5931456657","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3811991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gretta-Garoliina Sammalniemi","original_name":"Gretta-Garoliina Sammalniemi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842f0a9bd31116436fcbc4b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yannik Carstensen","original_name":"Yannik Carstensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842f0b9835f7f29bef2cbe2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487450,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Ulrich","original_name":"Ben Ulrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842f0d5835f7f29bef2cbe5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4080912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katharina Hein","original_name":"Katharina Hein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842f0e29cdba097ad4567aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJg0696zn3h6cKNzIf8aZX5k03P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f0BYeT6jY53PPhIeh5IlmNhLx04.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
