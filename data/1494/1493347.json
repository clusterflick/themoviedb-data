They were calculated and displayed with an interactive graphic screen of the Siemens Research Laboratory, Munich, in connection with a digital data processing unit. The unit allowed interactive operation – work under interactive visual control; a keyboard was used to change the elements interactively – for example, by specifying the number of picture elements, the angle of intersection, the speed of the sequence, and so on. The movement could be stopped for a static image at any time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Projecktionen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
