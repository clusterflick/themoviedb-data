Day dictated her responses over the phone to her longtime assistant, Judy Ruby (who lived far from Day’s home in Carmel, CA); Ruby then transcribed the tapes and sent them back to the star for revision and signature before the letters were mailed to fans. Ruby shared the recordings with Dunlap after Doris Day’s passing in 2019 at the age of 97.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Love, Doris!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35672797","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
