Known as the infamous \"Julita Pintuda\" group, they’ve become modern urban legends, fueled by jokes, theories, and a mix of fascination and disgust.  This documentary dives, for the first time, into the bizarre and unlikely depths of the case. Interviews with victims, witnesses, and enigmatic figures reveal a web of obsession, digital stalking, and vigilante justice. Leaked audio files, old profiles, police operations, and a mysterious cabin in the snow paint a chilling portrait — as disturbing as it is hypnotic.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/81zEdT1Hxhh80n5b2sG587HkE66.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Julita Pintuda","title":"CAÇADA DIGITAL: O Arquivo Julita Pintuda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Jurandir","original_name":"Carlos Jurandir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68430df44b7f5056d2fcc017","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriano Bottino","original_name":"Adriano Bottino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68430e0fe68027323b28a3ff","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elton Pruciano","original_name":"Elton Pruciano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68430e90c81e24212145688a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elton Pruciano","original_name":"Elton Pruciano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68430e9e8d7bd34c48539d52","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5487736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fernandinha Pruciano","original_name":"Fernandinha Pruciano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68430ec3891778f2534565ea","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8301,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Akira Yamaoka","original_name":"山岡晃","popularity":0.295,"profile_path":"/5UGhgcgwYBJgTSQcSWSODuAdjlt.jpg","credit_id":"68430ee050cc47616d7f5a35","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1071,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/81zEdT1Hxhh80n5b2sG587HkE66.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":["Inappropriate Language"],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"yes","release_date":"2025-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
