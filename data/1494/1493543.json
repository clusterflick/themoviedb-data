There always seems to be some sort of calamity before the curtain goes up, and Archibald Asparagus plays the role of the fixer-upper to make the shows go smoothly. The Veggies draw from stories from the Bible to learn about being a trustworthy person, having self-control and what it means to be gentle with others. Every show is filled with hilarious onstage performances, silly songs and crazy backstage antics that both entertain and bring home a lesson in Faithfulness, Gentleness and Self-Control. As part of the Bible's Fruit of the Spirit passage, kids will be inspired to practice these truths in big and small ways every day.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fruit of the Spirit Stories: Faithfulness, Gentleness, Self-Control","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
