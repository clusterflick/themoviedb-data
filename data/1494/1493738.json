They come from different backgrounds but have all fallen through the cracks, exiting mainstream society and entering a dysfunctional world of relationships borne of desperation. Apart from consuming and selling drugs, they work for The Pope, a pimp who organizes private parties for older men with the kids as entertainment. The story centers around Voodoo Doll, a new kid who works under The Pope whose face is always covered and whose past is shrouded in mystery. The gang feels threatened by Voodoo Doll because he is favored by the Pope. Between Dexter, the gang's boss, and Voodoo Doll, the tension quickly explodes, and only the intervention of The Pope temporarily calms things down. Dexter's girlfriend Joy is the one gang member who finds herself intrigued by Voodoo Doll's persona, and she attempts to get close to him. But Voodoo Doll is on a mission whose objective goes far beyond love or rivalry.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/kPuY6i71rODXIpA60OWrUWaJy49.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voodoo Doll","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Reynolds","original_name":"Jacob Reynolds","popularity":0.2554,"profile_path":"/zyhqlnG7KfPR9MRw1ptkjXzNd0R.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Voodoo Doll","credit_id":"6842f2e41c9e61268c7f578e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Gullette","original_name":"Sean Gullette","popularity":0.225,"profile_path":"/wziMZnskBjMe4Nnt1TaIaky3KMv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pope","credit_id":"6842f3282ab005893aad956c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Vicius","original_name":"Nicole Vicius","popularity":0.3119,"profile_path":"/dDUmyghQXkG3Y49NsC2jmCUpLzo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joy","credit_id":"6842f39770bfd2cb33539b2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sado","original_name":"Paul Sado","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/8JlWNT71tXgsyn02DEyt5Sr3NXS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dex","credit_id":"6842f3cff5b378169bf2ccfe","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Minervini","original_name":"Roberto Minervini","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/zcNq5ytNKWJQWnumnu3X9AGQ2Pj.jpg","credit_id":"6842f08c41f0e6898f1b05e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Minervini","original_name":"Roberto Minervini","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/zcNq5ytNKWJQWnumnu3X9AGQ2Pj.jpg","credit_id":"6842f3e37417edb485456680","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0418303","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kPuY6i71rODXIpA60OWrUWaJy49.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
