Strangely, no one understands them either. As they navigate a confusing and isolating day filled with miscommunication, frustration, and moments of quiet despair, the two strangers eventually cross paths.  Drawn together by their shared confusion, Yarik and Claire form an unlikely bond. As the day unfolds, their journey becomes a poignant exploration of identity, isolation, and the invisible threads that tie us all together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/u66l4Ltrdf5OMxKyFEIjoPDNsMN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":264430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Six/O Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ce n'est pas juste","title":"Songbird","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5486458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Mann","original_name":"Nikolai Mann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Yarik","credit_id":"684233c9f65a7ddf1228a219","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5486459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynsey Nalson","original_name":"Lynsey Nalson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"684233f0da11744987bf174f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4560638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eryn Booth","original_name":"Eryn Booth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684231a066b53ae4bebf1648","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4560638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eryn Booth","original_name":"Eryn Booth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684231b9c089c0f038bf170a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5486449,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joshua Tregear","original_name":"Joshua Tregear","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68423202c558685b94456430","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5486450,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Verity Hull","original_name":"Verity Hull","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684232208f172265394563fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5486451,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Suggitt","original_name":"Thomas Suggitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842324bf13ae6bc03bf1667","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4560638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eryn Booth","original_name":"Eryn Booth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68423258f24d849af5ad91ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4560638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eryn Booth","original_name":"Eryn Booth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842327714044d3c9a456457","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3746499,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Forrester","original_name":"James Forrester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6842329cbcc1aecfe11b0342","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1374,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u66l4Ltrdf5OMxKyFEIjoPDNsMN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":916}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Songbird | A Short Film","key":"Rnohy54YnnM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-01T12:57:12.000Z","id":"684235a53b60bce91d539778"}]}}}
