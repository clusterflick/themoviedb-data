Encouraged by her devoted husband, Farooq, she rises to fame despite cultural barriers, only to face severe backlash when her identity is revealed. As she dreams of a final concert in her homeland, the Taliban’s rise shatters her hopes, banning music and silencing artists. Yet, Mahwash refuses to be silenced. Through intimate performances and Farooq’s unwavering support, she keeps her melodies alive. Honored in Washington, D.C., she delivers a powerful final performance—a tribute to her homeland, an act of resistance, and a testament to music’s enduring power. Her voice, once exiled, becomes immortal.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hAPNZnUELvq7GJOd2qXhKAqtLq7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahwash: A Documentary Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5486580,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zahir Rashed","original_name":"Zahir Rashed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68425409244f2cfe394564a6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5486579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Javadi","original_name":"Sam Javadi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684254153088da4be5ad953e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25727536","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hAPNZnUELvq7GJOd2qXhKAqtLq7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6dWA3ve65YQRAmrei0wtDdYRXkM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zoAAhJegTIwpPXCQKLKKeZgc18.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
