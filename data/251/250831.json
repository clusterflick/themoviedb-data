For a year, marked by seasonal change in an atmosphere charged with the strangeness of Indians and the demons of the woods, we see Maria at work and prayer, struggling with decisions, choosing to stay in Canada, in love with François, seeking to change his rough behaviors, and dealing with extraordinary loss.","popularity":0.5349,"poster_path":"/n8EHU4pqD8hgS8O8mDu6ghAEhFW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":356,"logo_path":"/9tW5wZEGotn1Ei5pErA88m47XiD.png","name":"TF1 Films
