The documentary's storyline follows the youngest brother's travels around the world. Worried that he would enter the struggle for freedom against the Brazilian dictatorship, his family sent Heitor to London. There however, he dives head on into the \"Swinging London\" and, just like the European and American youth of the time period, he experiments with drugs and the mystic allure of India.  In the nine years he has traveled around the world, from 1969 to 1978, he has regularly written to his family. The documentary features interviews with Heitor today, his letters and off-screen comments of Heitor's sister, Lúcia Murat, the director of the movie.","popularity":0.1941,"poster_path":"/mSM6uuAFYbqNwBd0WNkZBPSrXSl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8542,"logo_path":"/3vpz4f0p59nGYb5kCExTD68DBfk.png","name":"Taiga Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2011-07-11","revenue":15350,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Long Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caio Blat","original_name":"Caio Blat","popularity":0.3368,"profile_path":"/8IOGXiIkJtBQNH1hWdLnkAyMoZ4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Heitor","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c911211c1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lúcia Murat","original_name":"Lúcia Murat","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/xZnoDL9iJLEpSKmCN7db3a4uRAO.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c911211cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lúcia Murat","original_name":"Lúcia Murat","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/xZnoDL9iJLEpSKmCN7db3a4uRAO.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c911211c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lúcia Murat","original_name":"Lúcia Murat","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/xZnoDL9iJLEpSKmCN7db3a4uRAO.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c911211d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285569,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rodrigo Monte","original_name":"Rodrigo Monte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7lbeRIwEEPVQ1469XMggN6OqsqF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c911211df","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":479668,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mair Tavares","original_name":"Mair Tavares","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/bu1Zi712MSolxj4t0uwfR297FPA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c911211e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965127,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dudu Miranda","original_name":"Dudu Miranda","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c911211d9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léo Bittencourt","original_name":"Léo Bittencourt","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":"/fmEFVuQ6DOdz5UuN8B1yKM6HFLv.jpg","credit_id":"637435bdab1bc7007662fc0e","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405958,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Marcier","original_name":"Lucas Marcier","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6374359b43999b007dd803b6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabiano Krieger","original_name":"Fabiano Krieger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6374358168ff7000c1683371","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189015,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simone Petrillo","original_name":"Simone Petrillo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/d5E8NiJzPe8elyaHFHAzXp5EjdP.jpg","credit_id":"63743631ad59b500793a69f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1694070,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maria Muricy","original_name":"Maria Muricy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/EUqPaymV1tNpDlNucoGT6aARdD.jpg","credit_id":"637436133d355700aadeb08b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189014,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"José Moreau Louzeiro","original_name":"José Moreau Louzeiro","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/sEz5O5BTDLlH0vmnWYHVmyQzjD1.jpg","credit_id":"637435f8fd4a96009b224588","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2103142","wikidata_id":"Q18276891","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1084,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mSM6uuAFYbqNwBd0WNkZBPSrXSl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
