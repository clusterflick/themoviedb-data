The most important one was Hubal, one of the main pre-islamic gods. A Film Far Beyond a God traces the origins of the conflicts that continue to afflict us today. It draws up three main motifs: the angst, the travel, and the desert. With this experimental documentary, Waël Noureddine films a knowingly hidden past in order to help us decipher the present.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film Far Beyond a God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Waël Noureddine","original_name":"Waël Noureddine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c91122875","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
