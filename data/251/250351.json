His work, mostly churches and private homes, displays a unique style that sets it apart from most 20th century architecture. The Episcopal Church in Tulsa built in the 1920s is a towering Art Deco icon, while the Hopewell Baptist Church in Edmond resembles a strange futuristic concrete teepee challenging the landscape. Bruce Goff is the great unknown of an original American form of architecture. Through his photo-driven style, Emigholz brilliantly exposes details of Goff's structures that might otherwise be missed, making these fascinating artifacts even more intriguing.","popularity":0.1066,"poster_path":"/yDEvmBU9rNuAquRu5wXO5Sz9v5d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie 451","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goff in the Desert","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c91121169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0415012","wikidata_id":"Q23013314","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yClxQ6PfZRvUNXsFPUt32vGfERG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2277,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yDEvmBU9rNuAquRu5wXO5Sz9v5d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1518}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AQ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
