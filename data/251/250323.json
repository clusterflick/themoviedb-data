This makes it easy to forget that people there do \"regular\" things... like play basketball. Salaam Dunk follows the American University of Iraq women's basketball team as they discover what it means to be students, athletes and friends. This is a story of triumph in the face of chaos and a testament to the perseverance of a handful of young Iraqi women. It shows us how sports can help build bridges of shared values, and potentially lead us toward a future of understanding within Iraq as well as abroad. Above all, Salaam Dunk is a film about basketball, friendship and the pain of losing those we love. From the joy of the team's first win to the pain of losing their coach forever, the film gives us an intimate glimpse into an Iraq we don't see on the news.","popularity":0.1622,"poster_path":"/qriAZYJJYIGm5qzO3uBd4CByCAH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seedwell Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salaam Dunk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1800370","wikidata_id":"Q7403349","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qriAZYJJYIGm5qzO3uBd4CByCAH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":6496,"name":"basketball"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
