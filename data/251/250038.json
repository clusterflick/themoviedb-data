Set in the 1930s, the middle-class gambler meets an elderly man who seems to bring him good luck at the gaming tables. Rather than treasure his friendship and the good fortune it brings, the gambler takes advantage of his friend, and by his actions drives the man to suicide. Unable to reconcile his own mental demons, the gambler wanders through the house of his dead friend, and his experiences there only serve to unsettle his mind more and more and more. In the last reels of the film, the fantasies of the hero's deranged mind take over.","popularity":0.4356,"poster_path":"/qnYlVtL4R5XDP5a4CM6Im8vJwfH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa de Filme
