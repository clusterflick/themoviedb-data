One day, an old woman with a long nose comes to the stand and claims that the herbs are bad and were better 50 years ago. Jakob is upset that she holds all the herbs to her nose and crushes them: \"Take it away from your long nose!\" he shouts and hits her hand. \"Don't you like it, my beautiful long nose?\" the woman scoffs, \"You should have one too, even longer than mine.\" Finally, she buys some cabbages, which she wants Jakob to carry home for her. Jakob resists but is persuaded by his mother. Other market women whisper whether the old woman is not the evil fairy Kräuterweis.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":"/ion1PmbO7DoevkTIOmxTQRvmYBu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schongerfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1953-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dwarf Nose","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Clarin","original_name":"Hans Clarin","popularity":0.2638,"profile_path":"/qL6QBPpkxQGFeW3NBdTqA3EvAGj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fürst","credit_id":"52fe4e029251416c9112388d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Elwenspoek","original_name":"Hans Elwenspoek","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Oberküchenmeister","credit_id":"52fe4e029251416c91123891","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diemut Gerstorfer","original_name":"Diemut Gerstorfer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mimi","credit_id":"52fe4e029251416c91123895","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Dieter Götz","original_name":"Hans Dieter Götz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kleiner Jakob","credit_id":"52fe4e029251416c91123899","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Eichberger","original_name":"Wolfgang Eichberger","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fürst","credit_id":"58298c0dc3a368360b03a95d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heini Göbel","original_name":"Heini Göbel","popularity":0.1938,"profile_path":"/9N2YYQ23HGXacvG3kKdGylSsGNe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58298c219251417b260387cb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Krüger","original_name":"Richard Krüger","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"58298c3a9251417b2c0360b1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Pongratz","original_name":"Alfred Pongratz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Hauptmann","credit_id":"58298cb5c3a368623f012508","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Schultze-Westrum","original_name":"Edith Schultze-Westrum","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/z2mvg24x7cfskTvtK9zEiSeMXth.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Jakobs Mutter","credit_id":"58298d009251417b2c036117","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elinor von Wallerstein","original_name":"Elinor von Wallerstein","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"58298d18c3a36823580000c7","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Rotmund","original_name":"Ernst Rotmund","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Herzog","credit_id":"5c3be3270e0a2655c48cc8f7","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Stefani","original_name":"Francesco Stefani","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e029251416c9112389f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36828,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Norbert Schultze","original_name":"Norbert Schultze","popularity":0.1269,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58298c8c9251417b2c0360d3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1548890,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wolf Schwan","original_name":"Wolf Schwan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58298d73c3a368360803222d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0138208","wikidata_id":"Q244020","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ion1PmbO7DoevkTIOmxTQRvmYBu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":576},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/FpHB14MP719BqFi5eTABLUl4Gi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3205,"name":"fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
