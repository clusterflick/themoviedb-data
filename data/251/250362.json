Nick is unhappy at his new school, where he is befriended by a boy named Sam and intimidated by scripture teacher Mr. Crabb, who is interested in the occult and demonology. Nick hears voices in the house and receives messages on his computer screen; he also suffers inexplicable blisters on his feet and grazes on his elbows and knees. When he dreams of burning and wakes up in a bed full of ashes, Nick tells a psychiatrist that he feels he is possessed by a demon.","popularity":0.2702,"poster_path":"/bJCxoNfswRqSTNXgdIkhDbAuxlI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Children's Film Unit","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daemon","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaud Morell","original_name":"Arnaud Morell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nick Foster","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c91121247","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1233763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Parnaby","original_name":"Bert Parnaby","popularity":0.2381,"profile_path":"/A3VZD02LrqbN1jitByPW509sPu5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Crabb","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c9112124b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susannah York","original_name":"Susannah York","popularity":0.5285,"profile_path":"/yVAEdAjp4IMgIR9GST9lh7HJRf4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c9112124f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadie Herlighy","original_name":"Sadie Herlighy","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jenny Foster","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c91121253","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Glaser","original_name":"Donna Glaser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Clare Foster","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c91121257","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orlando Swayne","original_name":"Orlando Swayne","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c9112125b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faith Steemson","original_name":"Faith Steemson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Helga","credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c9112125f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":159231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Finbow","original_name":"Colin Finbow","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c9112123d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":159231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Finbow","original_name":"Colin Finbow","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4df09251416c91121243","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090896","wikidata_id":"Q5208251","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":928,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/whf7tAfxkvCYg4MuM6XKv9jAeY6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1650}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJCxoNfswRqSTNXgdIkhDbAuxlI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
