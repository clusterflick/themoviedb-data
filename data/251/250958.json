It begins with an interview  to Marguerite Duras by Dominique Noguez, an expert in her work; the interview links the film to the two movies whom it's related to: The Ravishment of Lol V. Stein and The Vice-Consul.\r Several themes are tackled: childhood, autobiographical traces, relationships between differents characters and different films and more. India Song's main actors — Delphine Seyrig and Michael Lonsdale, who played Anne-Marie Stretter and the French vice-consul — join the conversation and talk about their roles and their craft. Marguerite Duras then evokes her memories of the shooting with the composer Carlos D'Alessio and her camera operato Bruno Nuytten.\r The conversations are punctuated by clips of the film.","popularity":0.2489,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colour of Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marguerite Duras","original_name":"Marguerite Duras","popularity":0.3234,"profile_path":"/fcwhMcwUzh4AtHew16vS4OVDYdO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b716a720e0a267ef618edfa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1946307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Noguez","original_name":"Dominique Noguez","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/i2MZXzwOrOzPg29RyRC0qffrDq6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Interviewer, Self","credit_id":"5b716a7f0e0a267ef819a7e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphine Seyrig","original_name":"Delphine Seyrig","popularity":0.6249,"profile_path":"/y9dTKRclY0UviYD5OuINL51tue7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b716acbc3a368188f18fd26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13683,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos D'Alessio","original_name":"Carlos D'Alessio","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b716adb925141404f15ed92","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34603,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bruno Nuytten","original_name":"Bruno Nuytten","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/rHyBG8jlldMYAInMO4l9XmNFvtL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b716ae7c3a3681899172b90","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lonsdale","original_name":"Michael Lonsdale","popularity":0.5007,"profile_path":"/lQZktsBj1CFbIEIpXOZp55kCiB5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b716af4c3a368189d17d128","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63898,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jérôme Beaujour","original_name":"Jérôme Beaujour","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b716a9b9251414064187d8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Mascolo","original_name":"Jean Mascolo","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b716aa6925141406a18df6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0144149","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213803,"name":"french cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
