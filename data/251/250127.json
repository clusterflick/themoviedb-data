The joke proved to be so good that rumors about the new exciting rock band spread from lips to lips and soon their intellectual circus grew into the Rock Marches - massive events involving thousands of people - that transformed into the big meetings for Lithuanian Independence later named the Singing Revolution. This is the story about the people who raised their independence with the smiles and songs regardless of the danger of the situation.","popularity":0.2993,"poster_path":"/5c1USmbYmjk6FRhym02XMu47t1R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66008,"logo_path":"/k0SjcmMcK3yxTRJj7GuMhiKCn8v.png","name":"Just A Moment","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":169855,"logo_path":"/owxjMUpB2uvfF0sdGrT6gQo2GY4.png","name":"13 Prods","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2012-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How We Played the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Algirdas Kaušpėdas","original_name":"Algirdas Kaušpėdas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"61a60f7ab458b80092195835","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443454,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vytautas Bikus","original_name":"Vytautas Bikus","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a6030a869e750045ffbd60","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1525201,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dagnė Vildžiūnaitė","original_name":"Dagnė Vildžiūnaitė","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/i8PHTsbjpuBMcOQSOkp3ynQxS7f.jpg","credit_id":"5abcc1c2c3a3684379025491","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giedrė Žickytė","original_name":"Giedrė Žickytė","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/bXh9IOpFKRv5vcIIygK9WKCnSep.jpg","credit_id":"5b139c870e0a263dd900d0a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eitvydas Doškus","original_name":"Eitvydas Doškus","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/a42t2FW11Y4tRGnSr6jGDeS1Zuf.jpg","credit_id":"5ceeeb39c3a36863821e0171","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2072137","wikidata_id":"Q12659183","facebook_id":"zaidziame.revoliucija","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1787,"iso_639_1":"lt","file_path":"/oCtLGTKfg9dBZSHchvgY3UuF4em.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1191},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"lt","file_path":"/hn2lPAU177t3gwjEdFgk8Z8ehpW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2743,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5c1USmbYmjk6FRhym02XMu47t1R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1829}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"V","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"DVD.
