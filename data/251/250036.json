Recently, an anonymous \"dream woman\" has been calling him for some seductive phone exchanges. As he searches out the identity of the mystery caller he is also distracted by Luisa who starts to insinuate herself back into his affections. Sooner or later, Alberto will just have to decide how to handle his love life, which in the end may only be mesmerizing to himself alone.","popularity":0.5843,"poster_path":"/e4Xl9hZnfhdW7PjpEaRu9td5QAi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ve.Ga
