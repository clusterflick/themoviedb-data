The film provided a novel treatment of the creature, which had previously appeared on film only as the victim of hunt films, with the unique underwater footage, shot by a cameraman behind glass in a tank concealed on the bed of the river in the opening scene, and a concluding scene, excised from the surviving print, in which it escapes the hunters. It was long thought lost until footage from a 1920s Visual Education re-release of the film, re-edited under the supervision of Professor J Arthur Thomson of Aberdeen University's Natural History Department, was rediscovered.","popularity":1.2309,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Otter Study","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2788870","wikidata_id":"Q4750198","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208333,"name":"otter"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
