Around 182,000 people lost their lives when 4500 villages and townships were destroyed in Kirkuk, Soleimanieh, Dahouk and Erbil regions with the aim to exterminate the Kurds and to arabize Kurdistan. Having found one of the mass graves after 24 years in the southern deserts of Iraq, became the basis of a movie describing the living conditions of these villages inhabited by mostly mothers, daughters, wives or sisters of those victims.","popularity":0.0748,"poster_path":"/tmcZDhCVKMlxELXfqU07lGCQ1DM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sheherazad Media
