Meanwhile, his brother-in-law (Jack Rice) has bought an interest in an outboard motor that is supposed to run all day on a cupful of gas. The suitor says he will finance it if the test is a success. Edgar is accidently pulled into the lake with the motor and it works well, but the \"rich\" beau says he will finance it as soon as he can find somebody to finance the drilling of his first oil well.","popularity":0.319,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motor Maniacs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Edgar Kennedy","credit_id":"5eff0f86d6d64d0036d29863","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Lake","original_name":"Florence Lake","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/8gMkdeMDR0ZjhZavHLaQYsBm235.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Florence Kennedy","credit_id":"5eff0f99a76ac50036001e8e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Rice","original_name":"Jack Rice","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/y2hZb8ifBbqESM17OjVnzA9wCLu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Florence's Brother","credit_id":"5eff1045d6d64d0037ceff20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dot Farley","original_name":"Dot Farley","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/sMOaVJca2FnFIRUs6L8zIuXAZnV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Florence's Mother","credit_id":"5eff10607b7b4d0037593651","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Kennedy","original_name":"Tom Kennedy","popularity":0.4924,"profile_path":"/alBZz3yjAGTx6FJXwfHIgInX30W.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mother's Suitor","credit_id":"5eff107151c01f003737817a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":34078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wallace Grissell","original_name":"Wallace Grissell","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eff0f3b7b7b4d003657feb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0126464","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
