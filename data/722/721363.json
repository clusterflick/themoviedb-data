The young orphaned and married, excessively wealthy Italian Marquesa Casati strove to be seen throughout her life. She was famous for the exuberant parties she organized. She allowed herself to be portrayed or photographed by numerous artists. With her black-rimmed eyes, her flaming red hair and eccentric behaviour she tried to gain a place in the art world.  Against the background of the war, librettist Frank Siera questions the importance of art. At a feast of Casati, Siera brings together all sorts of artists from the time of Casati. At the time, it was the Futurists who paved the way for fascism with their art. Casati does not engage with secular problems and focuses on her passion. In opera she goes even further than in real life; by not seeing, she tries to be seen herself.","popularity":0.1523,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":113783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch National Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ritratto: Dutch National Opera","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verity Wingate","original_name":"Verity Wingate","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Luisa C.S. di Soncino","credit_id":"5eff6cd5a284eb003795517f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Leech","original_name":"Polly Leech","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Romaine Brooks","credit_id":"5eff6ce3be7f350035aaa4b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paride Cataldo","original_name":"Paride Cataldo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gabriele Dâ€™Annunzio","credit_id":"5eff6cee5437f50037914bf0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paride Cataldo","original_name":"Paride Cataldo","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Garbi","credit_id":"5eff6cf89dee580037d08d97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Shahbazi","original_name":"Cameron Shahbazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sergei Diaghilev","credit_id":"5eff6d03be7f350033af39e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas van Lierop","original_name":"Lucas van Lierop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Man Ray","credit_id":"5eff6d10a76ac50034ffc4a3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederik Bergman","original_name":"Frederik Bergman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jacob Epstein","credit_id":"5eff6d1d51c01f0036377256","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Kraemer","original_name":"Dominic Kraemer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kees van Dongen","credit_id":"5eff6d29967cc70039200806","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammy Carlson","original_name":"Sammy Carlson","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Filippo Marinetti","credit_id":"5eff6d36967cc70039200813","order":8}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
