As the visit progresses, Izzy and Marek discover for the first time that complex historical baggage impinges on their curious friendship and, soon, they begin to understand why Kierk is driven towards destruction. Continued encounters with Marek's vaguely anti-Semitic cousin Irek (who is their only gateway to contact Kierk) only compound these tensions.","popularity":0.2941,"poster_path":"/v8bLpwr5JshTrnugRJ09XLoZ8jL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A friendship at odds with history, and two histories at odds with a friendship.","title":"Ezer Kenegdo","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Izzy Jonigkeyt","credit_id":"5f013ddc15959f0038589fce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deniz Demirer","original_name":"Deniz Demirer","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Marek Wisniewski","credit_id":"5f013ded15959f003858a001","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Nilsson","original_name":"Rob Nilsson","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/kqMgOljEdjiXSo8iWuOZ75ccPTr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harry Kierk","credit_id":"5f013df97caa470036deb79c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Safdie","original_name":"Josh Safdie","popularity":0.6051,"profile_path":"/bNYM97KLLVoICe3fZt6bKbvXV8d.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Levi","credit_id":"5f013e0615959f003957f0f1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kris Caltagirone","original_name":"Kris Caltagirone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Irek","credit_id":"5f013e15a284eb0038a15968","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Werner","original_name":"Penny Werner","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Minnie","credit_id":"5f03abe8d34eb30038a40b32","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"665a1621afb5a0f432109cb5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deniz Demirer","original_name":"Deniz Demirer","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665a162d523424141760a514","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"665901019ef4718ae693f237","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deniz Demirer","original_name":"Deniz Demirer","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f013dc4d0b4340033677d9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"5f013dabf03174003957719c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2644140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v8bLpwr5JshTrnugRJ09XLoZ8jL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":791}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer: Ezer Kenegdo (2017)","key":"58656176","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-01-31T19:46:57.000Z","id":"5f0248a28ec4ab00353fb80c"}]}}}
