Shot in Maine in black and white, it demonstrates Burckhardt's ability to take seemingly slight subjects -- flowers, fields, a pond -- and invest them with consequence by the simple act of looking. Instead of thinking about a daisy, compiling a list of its literary references, and planning a rise-and-fall drama based on a mental construct, Burckhardt simply sets out with his camera and films. As he shoots, he goes closer and closer to his chosen subject, putting the viewer into a trance, intoxicated by textures of petals, the myriad-flowered center, the unchoreographed dance the daisy makes on a breezy day. \" - Mobile Homes: The Art of Rudy Burckhardt, Institut d'Art Modern, Centre Julio Gonz√°lez, Valencia, Spain,1998.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daisy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudy Burckhardt","original_name":"Rudy Burckhardt","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/i8sIbuaK3f667J0I0PhYpssdzb8.jpg","credit_id":"5f025d1315959f0039594c44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
