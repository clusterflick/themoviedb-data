In Australia, as in many other western countries, as Ordinary People was filming, a new political force began drawing on the discontent of those who felt excluded from the promised benefits of globalisation. This revealing documentary follows One Nation candidate Colene Hughes over two years and two elections as her idealistic fervour slowly turns to disillusionment. Initially for Colene and her supporters, One Nation seems to offer true democracy and a way of knocking the country back into shape. But when Colene starts to question the control of party leaders, the gloves come off and, at the partyâ€™s annual general meeting, the two forces collide.","popularity":0.1497,"poster_path":"/uvgJx1590X2DCsw0gNOgkWHQUzP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":176487,"logo_path":"/2dAxG2ToL2GtNv9CVgZz5fjvr3C.png","name":"Ballad Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One woman, One Nation... two forces collide","title":"Ordinary People","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tara Morice","original_name":"Tara Morice","popularity":0.4987,"profile_path":"/6sEe9SGNFhDmCg83La8gWfd84Wf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"629c55abd71fb474e0e43105","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3576699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colene Hughes","original_name":"Colene Hughes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"629c5635a284eb00669044f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Hanson","original_name":"Pauline Hanson","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/qLBXMmv9ZUWGE79zBEszc8poHoV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"629c5665992fe60050b610f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Oldfield","original_name":"David Oldfield","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"629c56a17ad08c4e6710b1c2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502788,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kit Guyatt","original_name":"Kit Guyatt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c55badc1cb40e4943e304","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stefan Moore","original_name":"Stefan Moore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c55f37d5db5086be3d999","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Rutherford","original_name":"Jennifer Rutherford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c57de7ad08c4e66b0faaa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Rutherford","original_name":"Jennifer Rutherford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c57f3992fe6006682873c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":75046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Ansara","original_name":"Martha Ansara","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kb8MnTg5nw6wQWf3gRpid7aPDQQ.jpg","credit_id":"629c6a10caa5080067f7e465","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Rutherford","original_name":"Jennifer Rutherford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f023e61a284eb0038a3dbb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0314470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uvgJx1590X2DCsw0gNOgkWHQUzP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
