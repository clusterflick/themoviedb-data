It presents wedding night as a liminal event and projects the liminality of the event onto a psychic landscape. Placed at the edge of time, the nuptial chamber in the film becomes the feminine place of contemplation. The film is a search for the shadowy, nocturnal and the oneiric.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/d0y6D4lXUaXgWVhNRx5746VgZGu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughters of Scheherazade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711924,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ranjini Krishnan","original_name":"Ranjini Krishnan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0228817caa470036e0729b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3fuy9xOBxL9eJ9HGidZJcol6lIa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d0y6D4lXUaXgWVhNRx5746VgZGu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
