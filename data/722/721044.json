An isolated systems manager who's skin, the only thing that still embraces his body is starting to fall off because of a chronic lack of physical contact. To find a solution he will have to go way out of his comfort zone: from hugging therapy to visiting prostitutes. All the while with the clock ticking. As a systems manager, he knows how to connect everybody using his computer network, but making a personal connection is something he just can't do.","popularity":0.0591,"poster_path":"/dqb6rnksAfQ6PQLcV6uPQ6ABqol.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skinache","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Reus","original_name":"Mike Reus","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":"/nGgblCVItNHzYUT6xbOC4NTiIzl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Johan","credit_id":"5efdf18ea76ac50035fd9d89","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162047,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ellemieke Middelhoff","original_name":"Ellemieke Middelhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4b2353344c6007dc0bc3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3841637,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kaylee Hovemann","original_name":"Kaylee Hovemann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4b23e5c324700f04c0806","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657838,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Bente Mars","original_name":"Bente Mars","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4b24c35818f00933a83a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699061,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Meijer","original_name":"Thomas Meijer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efdf1b2be7f350035a879ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699062,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eveline Haverlag","original_name":"Eveline Haverlag","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efdf1c2be7f350035a87a2c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jos van Meerveld","original_name":"Jos van Meerveld","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efdf1a9a76ac50035fd9d99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7257902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqb6rnksAfQ6PQLcV6uPQ6ABqol.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
