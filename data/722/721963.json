Testimonies and fragment readings compose, together with a very powerful archive material, the story of a story that has a deep sense and cinematographic interest: the story of Andrés and his eternal fascination with horror literature and cinema b, the of the boy who was born to write, that of the young man who decided to mock death by planning his own ending. A film that tries to maintain the difficult balance on the fine line that separates and unites the two: man and work, work and man, in an eternal and indissoluble way.","popularity":0.1055,"poster_path":"/6gMOupmPYkrHhhCtZC9d02laxug.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120093,"logo_path":"/lIGqV3utxOtpINgBtJ2ez1Uvjuj.png","name":"Telepacífico","origin_country":"CO"},{"id":131560,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telepacífico","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2020-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A
