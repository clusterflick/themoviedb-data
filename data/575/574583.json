The film consists of three parts: a half-hour filmed in New York, a half-hour report of hitchhiking from the east to the west coast, and again another half hour in New York. The images are edited in a quick sequence; in some cases, the shots are only one frame in length.  The name White Line Fever refers to the monotonous succession of white markings on the motorway.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/rf5I12bo2QDrq7Wypc44K7ifPNO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1978-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Line Fever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3984afc3a368085346234e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3984b70e0a26443100b602","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3984be9251414de27364be","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3984c59251414de57367aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6174952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rf5I12bo2QDrq7Wypc44K7ifPNO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival International du Jeune Cinéma de Hyères","release_date":"1978-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Millennium Film Workshop","release_date":"1979-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
