Nisha is a young man from India who loves Yamini and wants to marry her, but since she's a Hindu and he's a Sikh, her family forbids it. At wit's end, Nishan travels to Paris, where he tries to get work, though he lacks the proper papers. Fixer, a recent arrival from Jamaica, is sympathetic to Nishan's problems and helps him set up his own business, a cheap curry stand. Unfortunately, Nishan is an atrocious cook, and his business is near the point of collapse when he meets Nathalie, who doesn't know enough about Indian cuisine to realize how awful his food really is. Nathalie hires Nishan to be her live-in chef, and he's soon promoted to boyfriend, though matters become complicated when Yamini arrives for a visit just as Nishan has to put together a gourmet meal for people who would know the difference.","popularity":0.0948,"poster_path":"/qv36L9BScxH7xW9AJWdU4PIgTlI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Dollar Curry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2206256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie Guieu","original_name":"Stéphanie Guieu","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":"/vpSHPIqSsnOnur5Q09GNIsjjHF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nadèjda","credit_id":"6307de34bb070d008436df32","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vijay Singh","original_name":"Vijay Singh","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c38598f9251412c751ee227","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0424326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.747,"height":791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qv36L9BScxH7xW9AJWdU4PIgTlI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
