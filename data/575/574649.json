I then hand processed the film in a very sloppy manner. I never mounted the film into slides I simply took the 35mm strips of film and spliced them together. Some of the rolls used in this film were shot by random people I sent a roll of film to that they shot and sent back to me.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/6owuDM8bDAJi8rStpkH41amCcBZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kodachrome Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Behrens","original_name":"Jon Behrens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xhZ7SNE1NU8ORphuH2vM4NE69Tk.jpg","credit_id":"5c39befec3a368086d469013","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6owuDM8bDAJi8rStpkH41amCcBZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
