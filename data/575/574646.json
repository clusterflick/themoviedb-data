Nevertheless, his short life was enough for his work to influence social and cultural spheres in Slovakia. First of all, however, he was a bohemian and a rebel able to see beyond his generation’s field of vision. He lived a life of an impalpable hothead floundering in loves, desires and passions. At the same time, as an author, his reasoning and views were precious and clear.","popularity":0.0961,"poster_path":"/vF5xayA5Gfatb8uiHhkv4iKCpgH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Furia Film","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2011-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary road-movie about a poet, lyricist and kook Jožo Urban.","title":"Little Mad Robinson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2089706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miro Žbirka","original_name":"Miro Žbirka","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/6A5qKH33fg9k099Ev7IwXVOmIbF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c39bcb79251414de273a06c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2215017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ján Lehotský","original_name":"Ján Lehotský","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c39bcc5c3a368084f4668dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Pižurný","original_name":"Anton Pižurný","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c39bcd20e0a26442d011746","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldemar Švábenský","original_name":"Waldemar Švábenský","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c39bcdcc3a3680869468cd3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ľubomír Vojtek","original_name":"Ľubomír Vojtek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c39bce50e0a26443401108f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380917,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lívia Filusová","original_name":"Lívia Filusová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39bd679251414dcc739afa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1671731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ján Meliš","original_name":"Ján Meliš","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39bd320e0a26443700f8ae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215026,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alžbeta Bohinská","original_name":"Alžbeta Bohinská","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39bd819251414dde739799","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1514597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tina Diosi","original_name":"Tina Diosi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39bd08c3a368086d468d1b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1514597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tina Diosi","original_name":"Tina Diosi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39bd1c9251414dde739723","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"zurivyrobinsonjozefurban","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFPcRCj8bfHZq0EkcYpJUkGqB4A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":845,"iso_639_1":"sk","file_path":"/vF5xayA5Gfatb8uiHhkv4iKCpgH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Malý zúrivý Robinson (2009) - Little Mad Robinson (EN subs) - preview","key":"oIgj_bTTKt8","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2012-07-20T20:09:50.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c39c0fec3a3680862465a58"}]}}}
