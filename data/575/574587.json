The images are interspersed with one another: a man and a woman are painted with white paint, while another couple is wrapped in paper and coloured with paint.  The second part of the film also consists of a performance. This time, Luyken works with life-sized, cartoon-like fantasy figures. Eventually they are numbered and wrapped in white paper.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entr'acte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c398644c3a368085f460881","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radboud Molijn","original_name":"Radboud Molijn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c39864c0e0a26442d00de26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thérèse Breuls","original_name":"Thérèse Breuls","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c3986559251414de57369cf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c398668c3a368085f460892","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39866f0e0a26443700b986","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39867d9251414de27366d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3986769251414dcc73605d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
