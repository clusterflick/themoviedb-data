From the iconic Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao to LA's Walt Disney Concert Hall, Gehry's buildings both intrigue and ignite. For Frank, rules are there to be broken. Alan Yentob explores Gehry's remarkable journey from poor outsider in Toronto to global 'starchitect' and follows the construction of a characteristically audacious new Gehry building in Sydney - his first in Australia.","popularity":0.3366,"poster_path":"/9cWWfdcuFyonvwN9W45aZITUTzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank Gehry: The Architect Says \"Why Can't I?\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"5c3a897e9251414de5749a51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Gehry","original_name":"Frank Gehry","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c3a898cc3a36808624771c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Aamoth","original_name":"Brian Aamoth","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61439edd85c0a20043cc5fc2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Isenberg","original_name":"Barbara Isenberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61439eed0cd32a0043ee0557","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Webb","original_name":"Craig Webb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61439efa85c0a2002956af44","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Winkeljohn","original_name":"Brad Winkeljohn","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61439f009f0e19008f5bff75","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sameer Kashyap","original_name":"Sameer Kashyap","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61439f0b9f0e19004371b6d6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Goldberger","original_name":"Paul Goldberger","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61439f22ed28b90042c14ca6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237055,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helen Vatsikopoulos","original_name":"Helen Vatsikopoulos","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61439c15006b0100447ab66c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1244073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally Aitken","original_name":"Sally Aitken","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/2GlQoCAixuvUOyiFal8jnHvC735.jpg","credit_id":"5c3a89a1c3a3682bc345358c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2215707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke McMahon","original_name":"Luke McMahon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3a89b4c3a3680866476e29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4884270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cWWfdcuFyonvwN9W45aZITUTzG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
