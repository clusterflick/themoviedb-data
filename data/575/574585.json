Luyken consistently begins with a triangle. From this triangle, new forms arise that eventually revert back into a triangle. This is a primitive version of morphing, a technique derived from the computer world: it is the gradual fading of one image into another image. In the animation, this technique was already known; an example of an animated film in which the images flow into one another is Pas a deux by Gerrit van Dijk and Monique Renault.  The drawings were made on a roll of numbered entrance tickets that were used at the Cinémathèque cinema in Paris. The numbers run from 99 to 0, but not all of the numbers are used in the animation.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/zm8byPx1wfcZLCzta76e3XBX31x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1977-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39855d9251414de2736578","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c39856d9251414deb736174","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3985750e0a26442a00c382","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c398564c3a368086d464fd7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zm8byPx1wfcZLCzta76e3XBX31x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival International du Jeune Cinéma de Hyères","release_date":"1977-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Maison des Beaux-Arts, Paris","release_date":"1977-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
