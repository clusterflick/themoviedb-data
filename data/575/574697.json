It is a work of fragmented histories: of the catastrophes of empire, war, terror and resistance of our times. Its unseen narrator 'encounters' the inhabitants of an undisclosed port city in old Europe as they stroll along a jetty in the melancholy fading light of evening. These meetings are with terrorists, philosophers, writers, photographers, shopkeepers whose subjective accounts and conjecture create a rupture within twentieth century history and beyond.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stella Polare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304690,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthea Kennedy","original_name":"Anthea Kennedy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3a13dec3a368085846cde1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Wiblin","original_name":"Ian Wiblin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3a13e80e0a2644340189a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1539064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
