The film ends with the demolition of a church building.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echelon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c398adb9251414dcc7365bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c398ae80e0a26442a00cba4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Luyken","original_name":"Edward Luyken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c398ae2c3a368086d46576e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
