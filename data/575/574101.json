Director Marcus A. Clarke follows the East Atlanta rapper on the 2016 Purple Reign tour, capturing live performances including “Gucci Flip Flops” and “Mask Off” as well as rare downtime—shooting hoops with Young Thug, doting over his kids, and listening to “Digital Dash” playback in the studio with Drake. Guests like Organized Noize’s Rico Wade, DJ Khaled, Metro Boomin, Yo Gotti, and André 3000 speak on Future’s obsessive work ethic and unique rhyme style. But it’s Future talking candidly about formative life moments—selling drugs, getting shot, his grandfather’s passing—that demonstrate his passion and desire to stay on top.","popularity":0.4265,"poster_path":"/t5JRmxYzYKrQ5Quw0WVtDsH5HY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62657,"logo_path":"/lrjP8bqSziFpahMsE13qImlWLBQ.png","name":"Mass Appeal","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's an evil world we live in...","title":"THE WIZRD","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2021205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Future","original_name":"Future","popularity":0.1521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c378d3e0e0a2631ab552bb1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Young Thug","original_name":"Young Thug","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":"/3BSMfiQhvaUHFx5lNGqXrevYNSP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c38439a9251412c721ed58d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André 3000","original_name":"André 3000","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/dQh7n7NiCzPxYOHyva4AG4n59cZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c3843a79251412c801ede76","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2166356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Metro Boomin","original_name":"Metro Boomin","popularity":0.3488,"profile_path":"/mS1z3fgaEEbwpGLbWjk8oSJ2XuN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c3843b20e0a267d6621c119","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1852967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus A.
