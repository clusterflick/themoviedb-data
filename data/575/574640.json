The classic story of love, betrayal and redemption has been reimagined in this stunning new version, with sets and costumes by Academy-Award winning designer Tim Yip (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), an ‘ominous, gothic’ (The Observer) adaptation of Adolphe Adam’s original score by composer Vincenzo Lamagna and performed by English National Ballet Philharmonic, dramaturgy from Ruth Little and lighting design from Tony Award-winner Mark Henderson.  Filmed live at the Liverpool Empire in October 2017, Akram Khan’s Giselle is directed for the screen by Ross MacGibbon.","popularity":0.0893,"poster_path":"/tbiTzn1HF5dmNx6ZHUP8iQvSuCR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133623,"logo_path":"/BemGGEKcR7vi9lgpxflE8p1KvW.png","name":"English National
