Ruth removes the tube and as the searing pain subsides, her memory begins to return. She looks out of the window and sees hundreds of identical ships orbiting a green planet. Ruth remembers the pledge she made to begin a new life, light years away from the earth. Suddenly there's a noise from the other side of a dividing screen and Ruth realises that she's not alone.","popularity":0.4551,"poster_path":"/o0WegWyvfkkPs8xuxh4ozzZeLWD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Long Arm Films","origin_country":""},{"id":12177,"logo_path":"/9P2VDiqTAr9qupVBbgCpf6FhLhn.png","name":"Ffilm Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":87836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edicis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Sum","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"zero_sum","type":"On-screen and poster title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aimee-Ffion Edwards","original_name":"Aimee-Ffion Edwards","popularity":0.9638,"profile_path":"/iwk8yjyWd46R5BFAYQLImFUvlHh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth Sharman","credit_id":"5c3bc7fc0e0a2646a28c3d6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Davis","original_name":"Phil Davis","popularity":0.9716,"profile_path":"/sNJ9nFWxpGVmQYvq7rU9xqryu0F.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Neumann","credit_id":"5c3bc8099251415318ab2d27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poppy Pedder","original_name":"Poppy Pedder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ruth Double (uncredited body double for Aimee-Ffion Edwards)","credit_id":"5c3bc8250e0a2654c18c9195","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jimmy Hay","original_name":"Jimmy Hay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3bc7d20e0a263c4f8c8197","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Gillingham","original_name":"James Gillingham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3bc7e09251416e2dab662d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5901530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o0WegWyvfkkPs8xuxh4ozzZeLWD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
