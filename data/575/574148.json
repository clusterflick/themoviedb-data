The film is set in the Balearic Islands, and offers viewers a moment to reflect on the profound presence of plastic in our lives and in our natural environment. The film also offers sweeping landscapes and mystic ocean depths - the point-of-encounter between man and nature – and intends to demonstrate how our over consumption of single-use plastic has tipped the scales, to the detriment of nature, and ultimately ourselves.","popularity":0.1275,"poster_path":"/3lLuGLPpbY8LuZHgFuMgo1HPXtH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Altamar TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Plastic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Line Hadsbjerg","original_name":"Line Hadsbjerg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c37c548c3a368623e93d7db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213462,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Manu San Felix","original_name":"Manu San Felix","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c37c5d20e0a2654a5d2ac03","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Line Hadsbjerg","original_name":"Line Hadsbjerg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c37c55b0e0a2654a5d2aa99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213460,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pep Bonet","original_name":"Pep Bonet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c37c5ae9251414a737076e9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213461,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Francisco Marquez","original_name":"Francisco Marquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c37c5c50e0a2654b3d2aa98","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3lLuGLPpbY8LuZHgFuMgo1HPXtH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":33480,"name":"environmental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Evolution Mallorca Film Festival","release_date":"2018-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
