Instead of seeking excuses for violence, the film and its makers wish to understand and display a male perspective (and more extensively that on more diverse gender dynamics) in abusive relationships. The choreography was constructed based on pedestrian movements and is deliberately made to not feel like a dance. It experiments with the limits of telling subtle, intricate feelings, by borrowing from filmmaker concepts of blocking and performance for “the camera.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"iwishyoustayed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Toh","original_name":"Brian Toh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65490438532acb00e1499f47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lights Dance Festival","release_date":"2023-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
