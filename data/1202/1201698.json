While the film concentrates on this period and the events leading up to it, in a wider sense, it uses the dramatic story of Murphy as a vehicle to consider some more fundamental issues about law. The film tackles the problem of police and security surveillance of the individual in Australian society and in particular, of prominent political and legal figures.","popularity":0.2133,"poster_path":"/5ba8gL7lOMYuU2vtU2FxKSOWjn4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1991-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr Neal Is Entitled to Be an Agitator","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Blackshield","original_name":"Tony Blackshield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65498ab71ac2927b2ebd3ddc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Brown","original_name":"David Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65498acf391b9c00e3db0e22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3183438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Dunstan","original_name":"Don Dunstan","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/eutRcMm2joIIcCf2hyIm8Tad228.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65498ae6fd4f800101b72f89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Dingo","original_name":"Ernie Dingo","popularity":0.2728,"profile_path":"/6xOMTFEQQIEi7BHuIicG5vqzyqU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Neal","credit_id":"65498af3d55c3d011cd0b037","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daryl Dellora","original_name":"Daryl Dellora","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65498b01924ce6011ec5ee3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371426,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sue Maslin","original_name":"Sue Maslin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65498b1967b61300afc7f025","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1783348","wikidata_id":"Q123287354","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5ba8gL7lOMYuU2vtU2FxKSOWjn4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
