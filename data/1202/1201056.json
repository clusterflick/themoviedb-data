It is the city where she met him for the first time at the age of 13, and where he sexually abused her over the following years. His wife and children still live there. Angot takes a camera and knocks on the doors of her family to push them to clarify their attitudes to her father’s crime that stretched over so many years. A cinematographic journey that challenges social norms and family perspectives in dealing with incest.","popularity":0.5632,"poster_path":"/bHAAyDoy3RjoEOPblq7n0SuWpLY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220458,"logo_path":"/uPvIlrVeK7aFdhFVwXcV6KrfW8c.png","name":"Le Bureau
