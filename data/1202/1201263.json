Peopleâ€™s physical and social environments, such as our homes, neighbourhoods and communities, play a fundamental role in ensuring that we can spend our old age in good health. Where We Grow Older starts off in Barcelona, where the city administration has seen it as its duty to provide housing where people can grow old in well-designed, supportive environments, so that they can maintain physically and socially active lives. We then visit Baltimore, where a group of architects and artists are working together with caretakers to co-design elderly housing with their perspective in mind.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where We Grow Older","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29729720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
