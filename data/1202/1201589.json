The artist’s recent research brought to light a trove of dormant 16mm film reels in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s storage that document scientific expeditions dating from the 1930s to 1970s. In Panorama, Siegel uses these source films of specimen field collection and the creation of the museum’s dioramas, along with her own contemporary footage, to create an entirely new, autonomous work of art.","popularity":0.1088,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panorama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amie Siegel","original_name":"Amie Siegel","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/f5eBoHdD1INhwCnLeOLaSl0ROuz.jpg","credit_id":"65495100532acb00e149b342","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bqA64pWUMhaYPNsIKUcqEHq3keJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
