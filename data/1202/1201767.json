Originally from New Mexico, LaForge exhibits a signature style that is instantly recognizable, yet perpetually reinvented. His bespoke painted clothing, which claimed the attention and subsequent partnership of famed designer Patricia Field, has become a specialized luxury, sought after by celebrities such as Debbie Harry, Beyonc√©, and Nicki Minaj. Layered with childhood fantasy and adult themes, classical inspiration and modern social commentary, his pieces are woven together using paint, found objects, fabric, and anything else that strikes his fancy.","popularity":0.3632,"poster_path":"/xhaewGgBdB4aBq5gZgsYZBp6Gti.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minsker and Lee Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scooter LaForge: A Life of Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scooter LaForge","original_name":"Scooter LaForge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6549e54067b6130102e0f976","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10577,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Patricia Field","original_name":"Patricia Field","popularity":0.2903,"profile_path":"/3CWJ9kUpd68AYGeL5mDMQoanIAR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6549e5986beaea00c9fdcbe4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Musto","original_name":"Michael Musto","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/m3Pm2zpfqPjjbZIK4VsmlgD2tlb.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6549e5b841a5613368853917","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4362012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Costello","original_name":"Jeffrey Costello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6549e5e5924ce600adb046bd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4362013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Tagliapietra","original_name":"Robert Tagliapietra","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6549e60d67b613013c49cc57","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Minsker","original_name":"Ethan Minsker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549e4f42866fa00fe00da3e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Minsker","original_name":"Ethan Minsker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549e50c1ac2927b2c81b354","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Minsker","original_name":"Ethan Minsker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549e45b41a561336d85d275","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Minsker","original_name":"Ethan Minsker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549e4a41ac2927b2f27010f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648685,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shayne Kamat","original_name":"Shayne Kamat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549e4d943494f011ec7d418","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4710513,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jackson Mooney","original_name":"Jackson Mooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6641661e7b19528f6059fd8e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27239324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@scooter_laforge_a_life_of_life","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cZYTJiAhCud3DYGocTE3xC2mLYu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xhaewGgBdB4aBq5gZgsYZBp6Gti.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1358}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
