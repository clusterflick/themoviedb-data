In 2011, the N-Men’s founder, John O’Shei, finally gave permission to filmmaker James Sweigert to tell their story. Sweigert spent 11 years digging through attics, basements and garages unearthing 86 minutes of never before seen footage and photos of the undocumented Northern California skate scene.","popularity":0.9146,"poster_path":"/dT7wVxJ4FDoobRrn6fMpYY0D6nW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"N-Men: The Untold Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Brolin","original_name":"Josh Brolin","popularity":2.9192,"profile_path":"/sX2etBbIkxRaCsATyw5ZpOVMPTD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John O’Shei","credit_id":"6547a59441a5613368843574","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Hawk","original_name":"Tony Hawk","popularity":0.6942,"profile_path":"/gYNmD0a7LemMX6zDZ1lyDs6YYwd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a688d55c3d00ff9612e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Hosoi","original_name":"Christian Hosoi","popularity":0.1559,"profile_path":"/gChQvOTP2vPyq9KeOfg9OGmeZML.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a6961ac2927b338794b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":401433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Alva","original_name":"Tony Alva","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/mabTBs5Pku0iwPzUolSxWCkDQkc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a6aa9cc67b013a31a8eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Caballero","original_name":"Steve Caballero","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/jf4HGZpQmXPO0vIorUMI9hw9d2C.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a6c1fd4f80013ce94b5b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John O'Shei","original_name":"John O'Shei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a6df6beaea00ac20ca3d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Guerrero","original_name":"Tommy Guerrero","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/c9QnZMGH6Vtak3aFKk8wjLBpnwd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a6f99cc67b013a31a908","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099258,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeffrey A.
