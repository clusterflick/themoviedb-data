His adored Princess Sida becomes a teen girlfriend, whom the demon Thotsakan - here in the form of a Swedish manager - lures out of paradise with promises. In the Forest of Mourning, the magical monkey Hanuman explains to the unfortunate and unsuspecting Prince Rama that he is predestined to destroy the demon in battle. This is his only chance to win his lover back. Teeny Prince Rama submits. And although in the end, the victor seems to collapse under the weight of the trials of his love, he understands that every person must face their fate.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86782,"logo_path":"/zuXKoPd9apgEOvy6rHthcEjJkR7.png","name":"Filmuniversit√§t Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ramakien - Through Western Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3036977,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Inka Fromme","original_name":"Inka Fromme","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654767d041a561336b7823d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Wilms","original_name":"Marco Wilms","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654767bc2866fa011bcfa6ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545494,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcel Buckan","original_name":"Marcel Buckan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654767e5d8cc4a00ad238a10","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352133,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Marc Lubosch","original_name":"Marc Lubosch","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654768011ac2927b33877e68","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
