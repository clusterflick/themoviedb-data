Together with a group of friends, he is working on a play that tells the story of an old jacket that symbolises the Palestinian identity. One day, after rehearsals, Jamal goes into the mountains with his friend Zreik, and on the way there he loses the jacket on a bus. A journey unfolds that takes Jamal from the mountains through Beirut, a city in radical transition, where successive crises and protests have left deep scars.","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":"/6vmS8wagnbmqxHFvxI8RSkV8lNS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187103,"logo_path":"/bxvMPyh4GId2c0WteMObqrtQ5oH.png","name":"Mirage Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":178950,"logo_path":"/jmccowZbLdJ2MZDHmkvwYS01vLX.png","name":"Fulgurance","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":26389,"logo_path":"/eZG7nmYHpVpp6jsOytILEmITHNf.png","name":"Family Affair Films","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":209896,"logo_path":"/lSTGt3GFAcJHTtc4Y0Iw7c8FEUM.png","name":"Placeless Films","origin_country":"LB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jacket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathijs Poppe","original_name":"Mathijs Poppe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65491bb31ac2927b338836c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3114952,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elisa Heene","original_name":"Elisa Heene","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65491ca6d55c3d00e2132843","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathijs Poppe","original_name":"Mathijs Poppe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65491ce0532acb00accb4b49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28802816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eZ74W4V1ab93RhnXqnHdocFFKGJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6vmS8wagnbmqxHFvxI8RSkV8lNS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Fest Gent","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
