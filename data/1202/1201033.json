Our film is an attempt to find out whether the spirit (if not the letter) of Godard’s experiments could be transferred to the suffocating reality of Russia on the eve of the 2011-2012 parliamentary and presidential elections. Godard’s film was released during a boisterous, revolutionary period in British politics and society. It was a manifesto for a new agitational cinema capable of describing the totality of social transformations in their dialectical emergence. Are we capable, in the midst of profound political and social reaction, of critically sharing Godard’s vision and aesthetics?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russian Sounds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chto Delat","original_name":"Chto Delat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65476ad2fd4f8000c7fc9979","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dmitry Vilensky","original_name":"Dmitry Vilensky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65476ac19cc67b011cef8e2a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
