Bringing the principles of contact improvisation into dialogue with tango not only increases tango’s creative range in terms of body shapes, embrace, and vocabulary, but it interrupts tango’s gendered lead/follow binary. The roles of leader and follower are exchanged so frequently and fluidly that the border between the two roles starts to dissolve.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contacting Tango","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliet McMains","original_name":"Juliet McMains","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654902b82866fa00c42534bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lights Dance Festival","release_date":"2023-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
