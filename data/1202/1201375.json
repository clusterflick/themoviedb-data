Slowly sinking into apathy, she began separating herself from the outside world. Her life turns upside down when she discovers a picture of a sheep, that in a series of absurd events, eventually draws her out of stagnation.  It’s a symbolic story about facing your fears and getting out of your comfort zone, loosely inspired by Haruki Murakami’s book 'A Wild Sheep Chase'.","popularity":0.073,"poster_path":"/2SYlmdXtDx1hszi1KqNwrXwYNeu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2023-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sheep Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","title":"Išsigąsti","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360333,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zofia Klamka","original_name":"Zofia Klamka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548c5372866fa011bd04e91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360333,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zofia Klamka","original_name":"Zofia Klamka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548c54c6beaea00eaf8f0f7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360333,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zofia Klamka","original_name":"Zofia Klamka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548c55dd8cc4a00e3cc8bf0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360333,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zofia Klamka","original_name":"Zofia Klamka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548c56ad55c3d01391fff57","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaikovski","original_name":"Gaikovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548c587532acb011b10205f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2703649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Przemysław Adamski","original_name":"Przemysław Adamski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548c59f532acb00fe355b31","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129956,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Haruki Murakami","original_name":"村上春樹","popularity":0.2212,"profile_path":"/5jUM7WUk1wE9w6uu1PaSDgiFaNU.jpg","credit_id":"67372705d63fed5826cf4de2","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34268368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2SYlmdXtDx1hszi1KqNwrXwYNeu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Scanorama","release_date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
