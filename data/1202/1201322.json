The story, supported by a voice-over, is based on a series of haunting images showing the body of a woman dead in a forest, then carried by a naked man: it is the story of a crime of passion. But this story is gradually diverted by the gap between the narration and the subtitles, then by the sound interventions.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'entends le noir (with English Subtitles)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4359975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Paré","original_name":"Jean Paré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"654875611ac2927b2c8115a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4359976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Painchaud","original_name":"Jeanne Painchaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6548757541a561336a234f18","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Lafontaine","original_name":"Yves Lafontaine","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qFpW0oeLNhH4NOzst8mlUlNOqc4.jpg","credit_id":"654875aed55c3d01391fd54d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel DeGagné","original_name":"Michel DeGagné","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654875f6924ce6013bb72885","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Lafontaine","original_name":"Yves Lafontaine","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qFpW0oeLNhH4NOzst8mlUlNOqc4.jpg","credit_id":"654875e5fd4f80013ce9b0ce","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Lafontaine","original_name":"Yves Lafontaine","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qFpW0oeLNhH4NOzst8mlUlNOqc4.jpg","credit_id":"654875d16beaea00c9fd166e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Lafontaine","original_name":"Yves Lafontaine","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qFpW0oeLNhH4NOzst8mlUlNOqc4.jpg","credit_id":"654875a21ac2927b2ebcd2d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4359978,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André Proulx","original_name":"André Proulx","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548758d6beaea012c8f4e4a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0248917","wikidata_id":"Q61967966","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
