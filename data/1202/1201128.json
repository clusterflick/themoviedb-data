One of the reasons was the fact that in 1938 he gave the communists the camera that captured the first footage of Mao Zedong. Ivens made several films about China, notably the twelve-hour picture Hoe Yukong de bergen verzette (How Yukong Moved the Mountains), a tribute to Mao's Cultural Revolution, which China itself called a 'catastrophe' shortly after. Actor Jeroen Willems follows in Ivens' footsteps, in an attempt to understand why Ivens never reconsidered his positive coverage.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":212791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lowland Services bv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Een oude vriend van het Chinese volk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeroen Willems","original_name":"Jeroen Willems","popularity":0.1245,"profile_path":"/czHYyHIbuOBrL5pn2TNe64jkL1z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6547b7bad55c3d011ccfedb3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6547b8d52866fa00ab118ade","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512704,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Seegers","original_name":"René Seegers","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547b88dd8cc4a011dc45b5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512704,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Seegers","original_name":"René Seegers","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547b8826beaea00eaf85671","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512704,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Seegers","original_name":"René Seegers","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547b87a41a56133693ae7ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512704,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Seegers","original_name":"René Seegers","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547b898d55c3d00e2127728","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark de Blok","original_name":"Mark de Blok","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547b81541a5613368843bfc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
