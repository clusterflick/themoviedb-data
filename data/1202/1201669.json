However, their attitudes and expectations reflect their upbringing. He finds her folks on the bohemian side, and she finds his parents to be \"Victorian.\" Marilyn's divorced roommate Esther (who is attending a class on marriage), advises finding common interests, but Doug finds Marilyn's modern dancing dull, and she feels the same way about his fishing. Perhaps more importantly, Marilyn wants a career as well as children and Doug thinks raising a family is a full-time occupation for a wife.","popularity":0.251,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brigham Young University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Are You the One?: Choosing a Mate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Are You the One?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Shulthies","original_name":"Carol Shulthies","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marilyn","credit_id":"6549726467b613011f407f17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1051719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith J.
