Through the saga of the the story of the Jewish migrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, who made their first home in Melbourne's inner-city suburb of Carlton, the film explores issues at the heart of Australia's development towards cultural diversity. The film builds a picture of poor immigrants who left Europe in the period of turmoil preceding, and in the wake of, the Second World War, having lost everything spiritually and materially. In a country most had never heard of on the other side of the earth, they began to rebuild their lives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":181143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amber Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1996-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bitter Herbs and Honey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Schwarz","original_name":"Monique Schwarz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549871b2866fa00c4255ba9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Schwarz","original_name":"Monique Schwarz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65498728532acb00fe35a379","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1051788","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
