On one hand we witness the care and effort that goes into maintaining the building, the painting, scrubbing, cleaning and gardening. On the other hand, we watch as aging inhabitants have to make adjustments to their spaces to accommodate the needs that come with old age, as well as to their habits in order to keep living in their familiar spaces.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Waves At Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
