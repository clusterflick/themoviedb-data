The young artist Katrina grew up here, for whom the forest is a place to find one's way, not to get lost. \"Umbra\" is a poetic documentation of the open-air art space created by the painter Andris Eglītis and his associates through Katrīna's personal experience and the scope of the world of the detached painter. It is a story about a community of artists and their creative everyday life – full of both joy and doubt.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/i3kdUEs1qYnjMLyeD695iy1cVAG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144940,"logo_path":"/uXEBguYOOPQ2UjOzgR44jIaKAtb.png","name":"fon Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umbra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrīna Eglīte","original_name":"Katrīna Eglīte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Katrīna Eglīte","credit_id":"654980af41a561336d859b9b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andris Eglītis","original_name":"Andris Eglītis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Andris Eglītis","credit_id":"654980bffd4f8000e480bbfc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361592,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elīna Silova","original_name":"Elīna Silova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65498221924ce600e53ffb0c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361589,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Valters Kalsers","original_name":"Valters Kalsers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654981cd532acb00accb6250","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785528,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dāvis Gauja","original_name":"Dāvis Gauja","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549803b532acb00accb6003","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964968,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivars Arutyunyan","original_name":"Ivars Arutyunyan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549820743494f013b7d37a5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Līva Vernere","original_name":"Līva Vernere","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gu0HmpzhTZ2AMxAVFOBq15Pbb8I.jpg","credit_id":"6549802c391b9c0100ed5a73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907373,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edvards Broders","original_name":"Edvards Broders","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65498075fd4f80013cea1744","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksejs Beļeckis","original_name":"Aleksejs Beļeckis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549801e924ce600adb00efb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Evija Vēbere","original_name":"Evija Vēbere","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654981f9532acb00c4830a3f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964966,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matīss Čudars","original_name":"Matīss Čudars","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65498215391b9c0100ed5d1f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3268862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Māris Lagzdiņš","original_name":"Māris Lagzdiņš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654981b343494f00ae21d278","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907373,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edvards Broders","original_name":"Edvards Broders","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d00605a5ed000e3f5a09a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksejs Beļeckis","original_name":"Aleksejs Beļeckis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d3508d4653700c4e3379a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1572,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r9uAn39l7mnVBNcuJyHd8kagOtN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2795}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2998,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/i3kdUEs1qYnjMLyeD695iy1cVAG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LTV","release_date":"2023-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
