Settled on a beach called Spiros on the Mediterranean coast, this tight-knit group, consisting mostly of pensioners, transformed a seaside plot into an improvised beach 'resort,' despite lacking official permission to stay in the area.  The film observes inner moments of how summer unfolds into Cyprus's last remaining improvised caravan park.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eHCOnNnxDjq4YBDCPsK5fSDKvpK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiros Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonis Pouliasis","original_name":"Antonis Pouliasis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547808c6beaea00eaf84043","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3922814,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stelios Demetriou","original_name":"Stelios Demetriou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547809dd55c3d00c5bed277","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358687,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Costas Drakos","original_name":"Costas Drakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654780b1d8cc4a011dc44905","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonis Pouliasis","original_name":"Antonis Pouliasis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654780f92866fa00e1ef6264","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHCOnNnxDjq4YBDCPsK5fSDKvpK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1152}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Leuven International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
