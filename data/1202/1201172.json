He wonders about their history. Among his favourite items are the Russian LPs by Pyotr Leschenko from the 1930s that he once inherited from his father. While Bosdriesz travels to Russia to learn more about the life of the singer whose music was forbidden in Soviet Russia, the turbulent history of the filmmaker's family is also addressed. During his trip, Bosdriesz talks to people who knew Leschenko.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":"/t2f11cwHDhSJ61U9LFRKFqj4qz0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43565,"logo_path":"/hNAOu2cYkKP0S0BTKaGoKmp93om.png","name":"SNG Film (Studio Nieuwe Gronden)","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lataster","original_name":"Peter Lataster","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547df8e9cc67b013a31bad4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4359097,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emile Bensdorp","original_name":"Emile Bensdorp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547dfb5d8cc4a01005b4a27","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Bosdriesz","original_name":"Jan Bosdriesz","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547df839cc67b00c4442249","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4359105,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Leshchenko","original_name":"Pyotr Leshchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547e0f6fd4f8000e48006a3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Bosdriesz","original_name":"Jan Bosdriesz","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547df49391b9c013ba1e00c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223872,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Gies","original_name":"Paul Gies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547dfaa6beaea00eaf86353","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Digna Sinke","original_name":"Digna Sinke","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547df79d55c3d00abfe98ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764276,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom D’Angremond","original_name":"Tom D’Angremond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547df991ac2927b2ebc84b7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1470935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t2f11cwHDhSJ61U9LFRKFqj4qz0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Black Eyes teaser","key":"NmNN7-43EUE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2009-03-10T12:06:25.000Z","id":"6547e0c76beaea014b687a08"}]}}}
