After some awkward catching up, they come to the realization that they have become complete opposites in more ways than ever before.: While Ben continues to live a rebellious existence as an artist, without concern for structure or long-term plans. Lize has transformed into an overworked yuppie, who is currently expecting her first child. At this moment, it seems that the only thing they have in common is that they don't really feel like attending this reunion. High school reunions tend to be dreadful occasions where people only come to boast about their apparent success in life. Why did Ben and Lize even bother showing up in the first place? Perhaps deep down, they hoped to find something here that they couldn't find elsewhere.","popularity":0.1294,"poster_path":"/grA3yWBA3Vm8quEe3bi9eJr2qrc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The reunion you never knew you needed.","title":"Vosnia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Vosnia","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tijmen Govaerts","original_name":"Tijmen Govaerts","popularity":0.2191,"profile_path":"/eKPKVwAYzPRMUp2Pm9VV9OfFiuC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"6548cfb5924ce600adafe091","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1677103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romy Lauwers","original_name":"Romy Lauwers","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/2NUipscd1BRLhIMqkqyp22etg1W.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lize","credit_id":"6548cfc9532acb011b1026c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Bouman","original_name":"Danny Bouman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/8lAX06jqgZ9GFC0BEM92LqEsLXD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Daniël, the pilot.","credit_id":"6548cfdbfd4f8000e4808931","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yanu Schepens","original_name":"Yanu Schepens","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Pizza Guy","credit_id":"6548cfe96beaea00ac216f8e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4362284,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Wolfgang Crabbé","original_name":"Wolfgang Crabbé","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654a3265532acb00fe35fded","department":"Art","job":"Props"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory F.
