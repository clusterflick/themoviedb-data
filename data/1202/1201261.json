The film was filmed in El Salvador in late 1979 and early 1980 and is a testimony of the daily struggle of the people against the military regime. The team of filmmakers coordinated by Paul Leduc collects the testimonies of the main actors in the conflict that led to a civil war that lasted 12 years, causing 75,000 dead and a million displaced, in a country of 5 million inhabitants. During those years, the United States sent a million dollars a day in aid to the Salvadoran army.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":212820,"logo_path":null,"name":"FAPU","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las Historias prohibidas de Pulgarcito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1980-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
