The most diverse ethnic groups live here without sharing a folklore or tradition, each one on its own, but united by two common elements: the exchange of money and personal space as a cause to defend. One street, Broadway, serves as boundary and as common ground for three communities: the recently arrived artists, the Dominicans and the ultra-Orthodox Jews, all together underneath the tracks of the elevated subway that goes to Manhattan. In this multicultural space, the stories of three characters are intertwined: Gonzalo a young theater director from Spain who demands too much from himself and the people around him; Richie, a young Hispanic drug dealer who dreams of escaping the basketball court where he carries out his business; and Abraham, a Jewish landlord who withdraws into his work in order to avoid a reality he can't bear to face.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Shoe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0483100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
