Scientists and farmers, peasants and young people express their opinions on these techniques and on the critical situation that the country is going through. The \"lone witness\", a tree abandoned to its fate in the middle of infertile pastures in the Puriscal area, leaves graphic testimony about the felling of trees taken to the absurd.","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/tpICOcWbY1hbgftL2JorTqgqO9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centro Costarricense de Producción Cinematográfica","origin_country":"CR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recuperación de la montaña","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1536994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Niehaus","original_name":"Ingo Niehaus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549822343494f013b7d37d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298458,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Sáenz","original_name":"Carlos Sáenz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549824b2866fa00ab124527","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2342506,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Víctor Vega","original_name":"Víctor Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65498260fd4f8000c7fd79cc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Vilaplana","original_name":"Jorge Vilaplana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549827ed55c3d00e21342b1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rafael Hine","original_name":"Rafael Hine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549829c532acb00c4830b47","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Yglesias","original_name":"Antonio Yglesias","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656777d6156cc700ca71144a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tpICOcWbY1hbgftL2JorTqgqO9T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1065}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
