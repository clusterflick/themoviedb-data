When he takes up metal detecting to find the wreckage, a growing fascination leads him to embark on a heartfelt mission, not only to research the backgrounds of the American crewmembers who parachuted off the plane into enemy territory, but to locate their descendants, to bring them to his Austrian town on the 75th anniversary of the crash, to introduce them to the townspeople who helped their fathers, and to unite his town in remembrance. Itâ€™s a story of empathy, resilience, and the enduring power of human connection.","popularity":0.2981,"poster_path":"/yChXrQD7yTDBSO7GsZYXja9q90A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Operation Pizzicato","origin_country":""},{"id":212874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buckets Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metal Detector","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Patrick Hughes","original_name":"Brendan Patrick Hughes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549115141a561336884e52c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Patrick Hughes","original_name":"Brendan Patrick Hughes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6549115f6beaea012c8fa1d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21860274","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yChXrQD7yTDBSO7GsZYXja9q90A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1201,"name":"austria"},{"id":204134,"name":"human interest"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2023-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE METAL DETECTOR on PBS | Official Trailer","key":"z5nQe52xqAk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-04T04:16:53.000Z","id":"654910fed55c3d00ff96cd44"}]}}}
