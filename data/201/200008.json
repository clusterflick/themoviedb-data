Année 5703","overview":"In the winter of 1943 two young Jews, Alek and Fryda, escape, via sewer tunnels, from the atrocities underway in Warsaw ghetto. Alek, entrusted with undeveloped photos of the horrors within, makes his way to a supposedly safe apartment only to find it occupied by Germans. Another tenant, a pole Stephania, abruptly offers to shelter him in her spacious apartment. She comforts him and they make love that very night. Stefania is uncommonly generous and willing to jeopardize her own safety by hiding a Jew. She even goes to a nearby church and rescues Fryda. But Fryda is ungrateful and proceeds to sabotage the trio's safety in insidious ways.","popularity":0.4221,"poster_path":"/f1wvTwJKlaJfgFZp7RQzwqUEQqk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Molécule","origin_country":""},{"id":1787,"logo_path":"/tWdfCS6OBkxSuXao5lluNKDIvlc.png","name":"CCC
