Back to Ararat is the first film to examine this tragic episode in depth. Traveling from the old ruins to new Armenian communities around the world, the film presents a people united in its dream of returning to its homeland. But no one will listen to their arguments. In fact, Turkish representatives in the film argue the genocide never took place. Back to Ararat is a powerful reminder of a global injustice which has gone unaddressed.","popularity":0.1505,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1988-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to Ararat","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Downing","original_name":"Jim Downing","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a368484e1b92a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","original_name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a368484e1b92b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1027727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Khardalian","original_name":"Suzanne Khardalian","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a368484e1b92b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Göran Gunér","original_name":"Göran Gunér","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a368484e1b92ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Göran Gunér","original_name":"Göran Gunér","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602c9ad62f3350164529487","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","original_name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602c9971b1f3c017c9d5c6e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","original_name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602c9923520e8017edac6d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672463,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toby Trotter","original_name":"Toby Trotter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602c99c3520e80132d5443d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","original_name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602c9b804733f0131e6b1e0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0096268","wikidata_id":"Q10697942","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
