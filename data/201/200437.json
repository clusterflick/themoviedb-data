In the course of an ongoing career that encompasses ground-breaking music, global gigging, award winning albums, and as many front covers &amp; critical backslaps as one lifetime can sensibly handle, Malmsteen has virtually reinvented the guitar as an instrument to be seen with. This DVD set includes 4 promo videos (\"Bedroom Eyes,\" \"Heaven Tonight,\" \"Save Our Love,\" and \"You Don't Remember\"), plus an interview with Barry Barnes conducted in 2006 at Malmsteen's studio in Miami, FL.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":"/bz3jD1AxKYgwSbGzMN0x3piTSSq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Pictures UK","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yngwie Malmsteen: Far Beyond the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yngwie Malmsteen","original_name":"Yngwie Malmsteen","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/b3OeoXvc00wda1aojdHAC7ONVp6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c86c3a368484e1bad7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Scott Soto","original_name":"Jeff Scott Soto","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c86c3a368484e1bad81","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Lynn Turner","original_name":"Joe Lynn Turner","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/sXptLe9cwizQSDDjiYdpY1hdh1w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c86c3a368484e1bad85","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1484,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bz3jD1AxKYgwSbGzMN0x3piTSSq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":989}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
