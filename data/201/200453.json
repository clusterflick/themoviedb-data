Janie's father, William Smith, objects and the judge allows him to give his version of their story. They had met in San Francisco fifteen months earlier and, after knowing each other only three days, had gotten married. Andy was sent overseas the day after the wedding and when he returns and despite the fact that Janie had borne him a son, they find they are almost strangers. Mr. Smith suggests, and the judge orders, that if they retrace their actions over the four days they knew each other they would regain their love.","popularity":1.0458,"poster_path":"/wO6FEIiTB8nOwzAPlXXIaNeuCKB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They found the answer to WAR-TIME MARRIAGES in the middle of a KISS!","title":"The Impatient Years","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Arthur","original_name":"Jean Arthur","popularity":0.3249,"profile_path":"/h46KhIQOOMPUMIdGNSN3A4zwcGQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Janie Anderson","credit_id":"52fe4c87c3a368484e1baff1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Bowman","original_name":"Lee Bowman","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/tGHg7HLfnjtpLhYFZJSUSbTS2s2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Andy Anderson","credit_id":"52fe4c87c3a368484e1baff5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Coburn","original_name":"Charles Coburn","popularity":0.363,"profile_path":"/cXEsKfIYdeVhpgjhqzaRCAgm5y7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"William Smith","credit_id":"52fe4c87c3a368484e1baff9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Buchanan","original_name":"Edgar Buchanan","popularity":0.5683,"profile_path":"/zKcqHZrqVsS0N4kdnqaD8vdOINI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Judge","credit_id":"52fe4c87c3a368484e1baffd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Grapewin","original_name":"Charley Grapewin","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/xROPwMkTUgweYQFhbTsvklIMhlw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Benjamin L.
