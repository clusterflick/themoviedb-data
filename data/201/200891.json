A village just like any other, with a pointed church spire, a supermarket and a new housing estate. But Donzdorf is the seat of \"Nuclear Blast Records\", one of the world's most successful independent heavy-metal record companies. The company's boss, Markus Staiger, grew up with heavy metal, like many young people in rural areas, and has turned his enthusiasm into an empire with branches in Los Angeles and other major cities. Housewives from the village work for the mail order department, sending out bloody skulls to every conceivable place in the world. Listening Sessions are held in the village pub, where the offerings are commented on by the regulars as critically as by international journalists. The film takes a look at the occasionally comical interaction of the tranquil village inhabitants with the rather crude hard rock scene.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/sEGb4l2WodIUh4LiBNq3L0R5ItG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Metal auf dem Lande","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Markus Staiger","original_name":"Markus Staiger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5edc78151dcb77001d01d9a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Barth","original_name":"Oliver Barth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5edc78378d52c90023a4e429","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2668790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Siegl","original_name":"Michael Siegl","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5edc7855b4224200229236ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2668791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Senay Aytemiz","original_name":"Senay Aytemiz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5edc786e8d52c90021a39c6e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2668792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Braun","original_name":"Johannes Braun","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/auBgIq2ySAmI59gzpSdu2lCjIgr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5edc78978d52c90023a4e449","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182301,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marc Rogoll","original_name":"Marc Rogoll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c98c3a368484e1bdf2f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51197,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jürgen Winkelblech","original_name":"Jürgen Winkelblech","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c98c3a368484e1bdf35","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Tielsch","original_name":"Thomas Tielsch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c98c3a368484e1bdf3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182302,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Britta Erich","original_name":"Britta Erich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c98c3a368484e1bdf41","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54671,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Veigel","original_name":"Patrick Veigel","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c98c3a368484e1bdf47","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Geiger","original_name":"Andreas Geiger","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c98c3a368484e1bdf4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Geiger","original_name":"Andreas Geiger","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c98c3a368484e1bdf53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0768194","wikidata_id":"Q21406048","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ebeowStwlYiObo7t2iD28EYQCjo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sEGb4l2WodIUh4LiBNq3L0R5ItG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
