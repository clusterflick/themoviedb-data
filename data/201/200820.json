Join the denziens of Generation X for an all-out crazy adventure as Tom and Trip, two cousins with nothing in common but trouble, take their best shot at making a buck in the real world. When Tom’s banana kingpin uncle freezes his trust fund, he is forced to battle a corrupt boss and the mob just to get a paycheck.
