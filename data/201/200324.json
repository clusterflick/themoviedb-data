Fairbanks stars as Lo Dorman, who has been ostracized from society because of this mixed ethnicity - his Native American mother was abandoned by his white father. When Lo catches the eye of the rich white debutante Nellie (Jewel Carmen), he becomes a target for the racist Sheriff Dunn (Sam De Grasse), who wants to break them up and take Nelli for his own. This love triangle becomes a quadrangle with the arrival of Teresa (Alma Rubens), who is on the run from the law. Through fire and fury Lo must decide who and what he truly loves.","popularity":4.5624,"poster_path":"/d66a73MZGiEfmD1KmTf7WdYeam5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fine Arts Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Half-Breed","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Fairbanks","original_name":"Douglas Fairbanks","popularity":0.2412,"profile_path":"/9wE2i9RDXFlHJlolDobQjKzlGWH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lo Dorman","credit_id":"53795f220e0a261419005f71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Rubens","original_name":"Alma Rubens","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/5E4uO4iO6cw0FsOL2oUcytqM1XN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"53795f2b0e0a261416006389","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam De Grasse","original_name":"Sam De Grasse","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/qiMJezjBhoygL6UDnGxF1wfqBm1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sheriff Dunn","credit_id":"53795f340e0a26141f006310","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wilson","original_name":"Tom Wilson","popularity":0.1718,"profile_path":"/wl63iKG9u51UY2dlULyramJhLnX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Curson","credit_id":"53795f3e0e0a26141f006316","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Brownlee","original_name":"Frank Brownlee","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":"/lPmD6rNE4boN95496BaRZcuAv2t.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Winslow Wynn","credit_id":"53795f470e0a261419005f77","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jewel Carmen","original_name":"Jewel Carmen","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/2BHyjeQ1YW6ZbhDTRnvUBW0V6JL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nellie","credit_id":"53795f500e0a26142200632f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Beranger","original_name":"George Beranger","popularity":0.1589,"profile_path":"/ila7m49FIrwRvaEn8LK6riEY4ox.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jack Brace","credit_id":"53795f5b0e0a26141c006406","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":580811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmo Lincoln","original_name":"Elmo Lincoln","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/dIWWIz9A7VIa73VYNzSe2XpzIHF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"53795f810e0a261419005f83","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Dwan","original_name":"Allan Dwan","popularity":0.2253,"profile_path":"/kAvLKEkjOpOzQSEpvFrjF0b5Nq9.jpg","credit_id":"53795f150e0a26141f00630c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11436,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Loos","original_name":"Anita Loos","popularity":0.1572,"profile_path":"/4APVlLs5pKLXsB5gliSf59kHVzF.jpg","credit_id":"564b6d57c3a3686028003e48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bret Harte","original_name":"Bret Harte","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564b6d61c3a368602400412e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Fleming","original_name":"Victor Fleming","popularity":0.6221,"profile_path":"/kwMaOpQnirmXFEuvP0t7Zc94sqj.jpg","credit_id":"565a7887925141691b00042c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
