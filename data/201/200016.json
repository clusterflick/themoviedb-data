Tamas a young coal miner has an eye for the girls but is too bashful to ask for a date. Juli is a teacher in charge of a kindergarten. She too has yearnings for love but fears showing the feelings bubbling within her. The quiet and tender moments the lovers spend together are contrasted with the overpowering gigantic and noisy coal mine with its dirty metal trucks and endless rubber conveyor belts. There is an atmosphere of impending danger within the mine.","popularity":0.1356,"poster_path":"/6ezqex4BlYYqE2QlKhdZWODneP3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1997-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamas and Juli","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2254631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Márta Angyal","original_name":"Márta Angyal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fUpCahnnQVi8GKBosFDW3JyEiLW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Juli","credit_id":"5c7a797c925141076947ae0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2254632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dávid Jánosi","original_name":"Dávid Jánosi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/daRkKp08kFSC8jS1DBDhFVjlu6I.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tamás","credit_id":"5c7a798cc3a36844e11b3b83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2140841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Ormandlaky","original_name":"Gloria Ormandlaky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sFgrDBHoAXd3EJqm0CwgwocMGaA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Panni","credit_id":"5c7a799e9251412a694a49eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"György Barkó","original_name":"György Barkó","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/wEPSCjvpADV3W0UHkCvMrafJOlk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7a79a50e0a2611de11a7ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Csaba Czene","original_name":"Csaba Czene","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/f1qOLJv9360fX1DPPEK33WWdEqK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7a79ac0e0a2637cb0ef21e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferenc Elek","original_name":"Ferenc Elek","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":"/zkBmlwNFXu4lJHUfMtcxYkuwtav.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7a79b49251412a5a4a67bc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2254634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jozsef Pongracz","original_name":"Jozsef Pongracz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7a79c3c3a36844d41b60fa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728073,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"András Tóth","original_name":"András Tóth","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7a79d3c3a3681c4b188c01","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ildikó Enyedi","original_name":"Ildikó Enyedi","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/1kU6MLhnizfBJuTj4gfz03euz2k.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c7ac3a368484e1b8cab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamás Sas","original_name":"Tamás Sas","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/vMdu3HoZFkBCNAEy3KKe36glMnF.jpg","credit_id":"56d1fdd8c3a3681e3e00b223","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ildikó Enyedi","original_name":"Ildikó Enyedi","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/1kU6MLhnizfBJuTj4gfz03euz2k.jpg","credit_id":"5c7a79640e0a2620ae0eda3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0135667","wikidata_id":"Q18745503","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/6ezqex4BlYYqE2QlKhdZWODneP3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1411,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/18ODYlBKtlpIAv1TWmbwITPTq21.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1007}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
