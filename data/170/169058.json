It doesn’t just inform us about whisky, it evokes the finesses of the liquor, the art of tasting, the craft of distillation, the history of the distilleries and the richness of the isle of Islay itself. The documentary takes us to a small Scottish island called Islay. It is the home of 8 world famous whisky distilleries. The complete process of making whisky is divided in 8 parts. The 8 distilleries represent each a part of this process, in order of appearance: Ardbeg, Kilchoman, Bowmore, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ila, Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Bruichladdich.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/pPhgXz5CHy4BJ8MSNF3CqiGY3R5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whisky: The Islay Edition","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Heads","original_name":"Michael Heads","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241cbf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mac Lellan, John","original_name":"Mac Lellan, John","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241cc3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MacAffer, Eddie","original_name":"MacAffer, Eddie","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241cc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brown, Andrew","original_name":"Brown, Andrew","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241ccb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Campbell, John","original_name":"Campbell, John","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241ccf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim McEwan","original_name":"Jim McEwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241cd3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160518,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Minnekeer, Bob","original_name":"Minnekeer, Bob","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241ca9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160517,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Molleman, Fabian","original_name":"Molleman, Fabian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241ca3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verhoeven, Olav","original_name":"Verhoeven, Olav","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241cb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160519,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bambust, Fran","original_name":"Bambust, Fran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241caf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160521,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Verhoeven, Olav","original_name":"Verhoeven, Olav","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241cbb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11256976","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pPhgXz5CHy4BJ8MSNF3CqiGY3R5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
