Here a group of performers of all stripes – the sink and litter basket receive equal billing to the human actors – are forced into Warhol and Tavel’s cruelly comical theatre of the absurd. Inside this cramped domestic space, boredom, confusion and a sense of existential dread hang heavy in the air. Warhol and Tavel transform the modern 1960s kitchen – replete with the latest gadgets and conveniences – into a chaotic laboratory for self-creation and interpersonal conflict.","popularity":0.2173,"poster_path":"/yuosE9BYwIEoGbZ4e30NI4qa2A0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edie Sedgwick","original_name":"Edie Sedgwick","popularity":0.3187,"profile_path":"/c2faghEu6JxlBNGJxvKY4sMo5co.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jo","credit_id":"5a62dde60e0a261a01006f45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Trudeau","original_name":"Roger Trudeau","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Nicky","credit_id":"5a62ddf10e0a2619f50070b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David McCabe","original_name":"David McCabe","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Photographer","credit_id":"67efe5accbd55b661fd93191","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Lyons","original_name":"Donald Lyons","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gerald","credit_id":"5a62ddc8c3a3687fa30066a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elecktrah","original_name":"Elecktrah","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nikki","credit_id":"5a62ddc19251410b21006ab1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18629,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronald Tavel","original_name":"Ronald Tavel","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/8EvWBM4nrc8iklIIa4U3PTis8r7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Offscreen Direction","credit_id":"5a62ddbac3a3687f7d00703a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1447661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Ricard","original_name":"Rene Ricard","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/czXEnsjc2zVPMgR4D4Q3tqIzjkL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Busboy","credit_id":"5a62dddf9251410b1a006a50","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Malanga","original_name":"Gerard Malanga","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":"/h5wHiT55EJHC9VvlnCVZi2wNW76.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a62ddcfc3a3687f6e006bef","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ce4c3a36847f8243451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18629,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronald Tavel","original_name":"Ronald Tavel","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/8EvWBM4nrc8iklIIa4U3PTis8r7.jpg","credit_id":"5a62de0c0e0a2619f50070de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18629,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronald Tavel","original_name":"Ronald Tavel","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/8EvWBM4nrc8iklIIa4U3PTis8r7.jpg","credit_id":"5a62de159251410b25006ed9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0190508","wikidata_id":"Q1743847","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cPjykn5oIhztEWTKH16XpLuB0wG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yuosE9BYwIEoGbZ4e30NI4qa2A0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9IcW1J4vXnoqjS75Tj3ZyubVUa3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Film-Makers' Cinematheque","release_date":"1966-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"edie sedgwick in \"Kitchen\" (black & white)","key":"4x2zV3Gu66g","published_at":"2009-12-08T17:13:11.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5a62df62c3a3687f980066b2"}]}}}
