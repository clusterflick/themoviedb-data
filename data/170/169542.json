The filmmakers spent more than 20 years documenting the Soviet occupation, the exile of millions of refugees maimed by Soviet mines, a violent civil war, the fatal alliance of the Taliban with al-Qaeda, the invasion by United States forces and people still determined to survive to this day. Filmmakers Jim Burroughs and Suzanne Bauman have a wealth of footage from more than 20 years of following this story, as well as compelling footage from the 1950s and '60s showing life in Afghanistan before the war.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/nY30HvPsNBQCHDuIO1J1xOtBJUI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow of Afghanistan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Burroughs","original_name":"Jim Burroughs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8c07714b0c633ca72b9d47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2592475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Bauman","original_name":"Suzanne Bauman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8c077f105611001185292f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1521052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1394,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nY30HvPsNBQCHDuIO1J1xOtBJUI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
