Who can the police turn to? Harry Bates, of course, the smartest officer on the force. TOO BAD HARRY CAN’T OUTWIT A HOUSEPLANT! Lucky for him he has his trusted partner Dick Smoker and his faithful dog (who seems to be a guy in a dog suit) to help him solve the case. The only suspects are a pair of beautiful sisters, Montana and Dakota. When the trigger happy Harry gets romantically involved with the twin half step-sisters will he lose more than his cool? Inspired lunacy ensues as BLONDES HAVE MORE GUNS parodies the likes of PULP FICTION and INDECENT PROPOSAL with razor… er… chainsaw sharp wit!","popularity":0.6403,"poster_path":"/jJoM3BoRQEpGou3lMD8wAFfn3Zb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3052,"logo_path":"/kqP7DC8cUCzDSI5SXiJKJKmQg1K.png","name":"Troma Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blondes Have More Guns","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1151262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael McGaharn","original_name":"Michael McGaharn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/3QPgejQkZlbcpFel4R8caHoXQdE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harry Bates","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241c37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Keifer","original_name":"Elizabeth Keifer","popularity":0.2523,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Montana Beaver-Shotz","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241c3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Neil","original_name":"Richard Neil","popularity":0.1254,"profile_path":"/eAGY6YYiayce7xGDX1OcnKgTneK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dick Smoker","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241c3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1151264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Lusiak","original_name":"Gloria Lusiak","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dakota Beaver","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241c43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1151266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Brazeau","original_name":"André Brazeau","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Captain Hook","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a36847f8241c47","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1151267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian A.
