During this revolution, there was a genuine solidarity between people from different levels of the society, from the cities and the countryside. Although these people were brought up in a Soviet society where every protest against the authorities was a danger to one's life, they were so disappointed by what came after the collapse of the Soviet Union that they went out to the streets, faced the authorities and made the orange revolution possible. The film explores motives for taking part in the Ukrainian revolution, their view of the world, living-condition and hope for the future.","popularity":0.3393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Orange Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":412977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Polak","original_name":"Hanna Polak","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/xcEYhYPGqX0k7p1Jgj1w47MPUV9.jpg","credit_id":"629962cd7e12f02c83c92227","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73793,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piotr Jaxa","original_name":"Piotr Jaxa","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a74830c3a3682248000a95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ursula Lesiak","original_name":"Ursula Lesiak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7484492514130d60009e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2020,"name":"revolution"},{"id":228352,"name":"orange revolution (ukraine)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
