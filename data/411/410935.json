Through the intimate portrayal of these boys, this powerful vérité film offers a rare in-depth look at the issues facing America's rural youth and the complex relationships between generational poverty, educational equity, and race. The evocative result is an experience that encourages us to recognize the value and complexity in lives all too often ignored.","popularity":0.367,"poster_path":"/wXioy5OesJxyneW7nHOaT1tQE7D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film Producers (IFP)","origin_country":""},{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/g7FpsadP1UG9MotNi54RvE5hiGY.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An intimate portrait of three African American boys coming of age in rural North Carolina","title":"Raising Bertie","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298695,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Byrne","original_name":"Margaret Byrne","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca0ab925141479f000ccf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298695,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Byrne","original_name":"Margaret Byrne","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca0b8c3a3681d6000227a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leslie Simmer","original_name":"Leslie Simmer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca0c39251414745000dc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608022,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Stuyvesant","original_name":"Jon Stuyvesant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca1b9c3a3686403000d66","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608022,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Stuyvesant","original_name":"Jon Stuyvesant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca1c5c3a3681daa002313","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leslie Simmer","original_name":"Leslie Simmer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca1d5c3a3681e02001fc5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1030154,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justine Nagan","original_name":"Justine Nagan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca210c3a3681daa002339","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Quinn","original_name":"Gordon Quinn","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57aca222c3a3686406000d4f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2903158","wikidata_id":"Q26899519","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wXioy5OesJxyneW7nHOaT1tQE7D.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RAISING BERTIE | Official Trailer HD","key":"4ufvE--JGNY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-04-11T19:06:15.000Z","id":"601d8388b97442003f29fdc6"}]}}}
