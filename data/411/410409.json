His arranging skills are unique and are permanently set in Brazilian music through singers such as Elis Regina, Simone and just about the best in Brazil and around the world. On the other side of this duo, we find Pedro Mariano, son of Cesar Camargo Mariano and the late Elis Regina. Though father and son had previously collaborated in Pedro’s three solo albums, with Piano &amp; Voz they formalize that artistic synergy with a memorable recording (also available on DVD). Piano &amp; Voz had a limited release of 10,000 units, but in case you are not able to get a hold of the album, there is also DVD release of the same project. You can hear samples of this album in either Pedro Mariano‘s or Cesar Camargo Mariano‘s web sites. Better yet, you can see and hear Cesar Camargo Mariano talking about each track in the CD and DVD at Trama.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cesar Camargo Mariano e Pedro Mariano - Piano & Voz","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César Camargo Mariano","original_name":"César Camargo Mariano","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Pianist","credit_id":"57a79757c3a368088200120f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Mariano","original_name":"Pedro Mariano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Singer","credit_id":"57a7976fc3a36822480039e9","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
