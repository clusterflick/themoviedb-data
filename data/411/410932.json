However officious OFSTED inspector Wharton regards it as a waste of money and a means of teaching children disrespect - though his assistant Myrtle is charmed by its ambience. In a court hearing to decide the school's future barrister Geoffrey Robertson points to the many alumni from the school but also, thanks to a tip-off from a pupil, is able to reveal that Wharton had told Myrtle that the school was virtually due for closure and the inspection was purely a formality. Consequently Summerhill is saved, Myrtle gets to teach there and the children launch a pirate ship with the banner 'Freedom' to celebrate the victory. Two children whose future at the school looked uncertain are also given cause to celebrate.","popularity":1.049,"poster_path":"/e4oDyofTJI7SH1zh6YjM2kkWOzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summerhill","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1231201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connor McIntyre","original_name":"Connor McIntyre","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/lwq4FfVC4dJ2V1Djpgg60ItdRIs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Len","credit_id":"5d82ceda162bc30272dcf844","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olly Alexander","original_name":"Olly Alexander","popularity":0.6038,"profile_path":"/hTLsUHkpe05QQiSbmPLv7JhsvEW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ned","credit_id":"5d82cee5162bc30240dd05bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Gemmell","original_name":"Ruth Gemmell","popularity":1.0349,"profile_path":"/lq8W1V45lIWAhpgjb7ezYB3B79p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"5d82cef19e45860226942c11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Badland","original_name":"Annette Badland","popularity":0.9123,"profile_path":"/6ZoUX6K4WI2MZrhXb21vU5Mtc6P.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Myrtle","credit_id":"5d82cf02162bc30227dd0f50","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessie Cave","original_name":"Jessie Cave","popularity":0.4932,"profile_path":"/vVfGAQuqWKS768bFw9sxtHAQAiz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Stella","credit_id":"5d82cf11c490480221d11825","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1814912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Mae Loughran","original_name":"Lola Mae Loughran","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":"/r1vAaNWIRPzKIqQq6zDsLqXv6O.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ellen","credit_id":"5f726a0fd55e4d0037926033","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5325844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Rogers","original_name":"Karl Rogers","popularity":0.2029,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"67e1c7430ee53d4e71f05122","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1756874,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anna Bertmark","original_name":"Anna Bertmark","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/bmTm5Id86gFY70oUTNsNItFhjgW.jpg","credit_id":"6600abfc1b1f3c0163987eb8","department":"Sound","job":"Dialogue Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon East","original_name":"Jon East","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4949849b8616001161dcdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540493,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alison Hume","original_name":"Alison Hume","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e49498f1e92250015c21bb3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4579809,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Benjamin Rosenberg","original_name":"Benjamin Rosenberg","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":"/1jXpD9WDOxA43MUodaSou4kqQ9H.jpg","credit_id":"67d8cfdec4c2b520a0859aa9","department":"Production","job":"Production Runner"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1042913","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1126,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e4oDyofTJI7SH1zh6YjM2kkWOzG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Only year is valid","release_date":"2008-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
