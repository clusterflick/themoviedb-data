A spunky 12 year old Pearl soars as she befriends world renowned pilot Wiley Post, which introduces her to a love for flying and to becoming the youngest pilot in American aviation history.  Raised in the late 1920's in Marlow, Oklahoma, Pearl encountered her share of obstacles. This Chickasaw girl rises above adversity, takes on responsibility and, with the guidance of her father, holds fast to her 'never give up' attitude.  The story of Pearl Carter Scott is one worth telling, as it is inspiring, heartfelt and true to the character of Pearl.\r This film is sure to spur encouragement in the hearts and minds of its viewers. Pearl reminds us of the resilience, determination and drive we all have within us - that dreams are possible when you 'never give up'.","popularity":0.0706,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A daredevil who dared to dream.","title":"Pearl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pearl Carter Scott","original_name":"Pearl Carter Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Elijah DeJesus","credit_id":"57a7c63a9251415538000a67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Huston Orr","original_name":"Tom Huston Orr","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Wiley Post","credit_id":"57a7c68a925141544d000aea","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1328874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
