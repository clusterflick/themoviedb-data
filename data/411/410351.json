In a crowded hall, some musicians are warming up. Cacophony. The conductor calls for silence. On a river bank at dawn, an old man is fishing alone, alert. Nearby, a band of Indians are marching to music for the carnival. A young hunter stalks her prey on the edge of a forest, while in his bedroom, a teenager struggles with his tie to the deafening sound of symphonic heavy metal rock. Between community and moments of solitude, through a series of lively Friday evening rehearsals and the interminable republican ceremonies, L'harmonie takes us to the heart of this colorful community in search of harmony.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/2iegoBpuXHH0CjcdbyaUdvyags3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'harmonie","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662780,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Blaise Harrison","original_name":"Blaise Harrison","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a73543c3a36822b4000044","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662780,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Blaise Harrison","original_name":"Blaise Harrison","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7355b925141307d000069","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lionel Baier","original_name":"Lionel Baier","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":"/9M71WDLgjJAPJwoGmVezPqvEeDO.jpg","credit_id":"57a73ad9c3a368256c002c02","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1662788,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Estelle Fialon","original_name":"Estelle Fialon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a73aedc3a36822480003a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3004714","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1358,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2iegoBpuXHH0CjcdbyaUdvyags3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2013-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
