It is for that reason that they jump off a bridge one July evening. In the psychiatric ward where they were taken, they get to know an old schizophrenic who takes himself for the dancer Nijinsky and who will dance his last ballet with them, on the run in the streets of Paris. From bridge to bridge, from street to street, on the macadam and on the water of the Seine, Milan will pursue his quest and will try to understand the mysterious disappearance of Nola.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up to Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jules Ritmanic","original_name":"Jules Ritmanic","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":"/vlWy8aeZNrnrb4wIE3y1lcKlpLY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Milan","credit_id":"57a98888c3a368738f003b81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1070631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pénélope-Rose Lévèque","original_name":"Pénélope-Rose Lévèque","popularity":0.1809,"profile_path":"/auaR55kbWsGGQyLQ5B0vcpGNnjP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nola","credit_id":"57a9889192514138b10043e0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":469759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Bergès-Frisbey","original_name":"Astrid Bergès-Frisbey","popularity":1.7183,"profile_path":"/2mcTwrg61M7beQv05YQFPLWADmc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clara","credit_id":"57a988c1925141383f00413d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Héléna Noguerra","original_name":"Héléna Noguerra","popularity":0.2325,"profile_path":"/rgEpXWFmfsB0EgZw6c6CsOaoxbu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"57a988b992514138b10043ee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mélianne Marcaggi","original_name":"Mélianne Marcaggi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Malva","credit_id":"57a988b0c3a368733b004019","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Frantz","original_name":"Jacques Frantz","popularity":0.3428,"profile_path":"/tGa8DHACbaDKnNRBGWSJjgEf2KS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nijinsky","credit_id":"57d1c0ab9251410ca2000b31","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorine Hollier","original_name":"Dorine Hollier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a98913c3a368254e00fc70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4589560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
