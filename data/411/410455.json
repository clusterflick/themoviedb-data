They come from broken homes and low-income, high-risk communities in Chicago where barely 50% of young black men graduate from high school and of those that do graduate less than half go on to college and even fewer will graduate within 4 to 6 years. The film explores the factors in their lives (education, parents and grandparents, teachers, role models, personal drive and community support) that made all the difference in helping them be the first in their families to most likely escape poverty and secure a place in the middle class.","popularity":0.2792,"poster_path":"/qIxJ4f0goozL5jdemzI6dutPA28.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Difference","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Henderson","original_name":"Robert Henderson","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57a7ec8a925141746f0016bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krishaun Branch","original_name":"Krishaun Branch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"57a7ec9e92514177dc00147d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Lending","original_name":"Tod Lending","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7ebf69251415cfb001e85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1663112,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wes Moore","original_name":"Wes Moore","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/9dXdJaLtMqqqRUB9AyJigHb4yGl.jpg","credit_id":"57a7ec20925141775000156d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bhagyashree Raorane","original_name":"Bhagyashree Raorane","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7ec30c3a368254e0016f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joy Thomas Moore","original_name":"Joy Thomas Moore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7ec409251415cfb001eaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Selma Mutal","original_name":"Selma Mutal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7ec4e925141777c001575","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Lending","original_name":"Tod Lending","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7ec61c3a368254e001712","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663115,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melissa Sterne","original_name":"Melissa Sterne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7ec6892514177dc001448","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4776436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qIxJ4f0goozL5jdemzI6dutPA28.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"All the Difference - Trailer - POV 2016 | PBS","key":"Qf_-dHjKJh0","published_at":"2016-03-21T14:39:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"57a7ed16925141777c0015ec"}]}}}
