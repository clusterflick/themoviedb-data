She has the baby and turns it over to her \"employer,\" but subsequently decides she wants the child back. She hires three men to kidnap the child. The quartet hides out in the house of Bernard Lapin, a nuclear scientist they believe to be away on business. Lapin returns, however, and becomes romantically involved with Delia.
