Her father has left the family, and she is desperate to see him. Sarah speaks to only one person: her best friend Allison, who bears witness to the deteriorating relationship between Sarah and her mother Diane, whom Sarah blames for her father's absence. When a heated argument leaves both mother and daughter's emotions exposed, Sarah seeks out Allison. In doing so, Sarah is forced to confront both a part of her past and a present reality that she may not be prepared to live within.","popularity":0.7552,"poster_path":"/voLe0RPWE6UNhiMBPScyF16NDq2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Learn
