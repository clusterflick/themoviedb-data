Drawing on Spencer’s controversial legacy as an evolutionary biologist whose work influenced the Stolen Generation policy, the film seeks to decolonize the building and reimagine its significance. Grounded in Tamiru’s perspective, it serves as a powerful reflection on confronting painful histories and fostering transformative dialogue.","popularity":0.0544,"poster_path":"/fd1IYHdwrICNJedm16wfm4KVcCs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Debil Debil Baldwin Spencer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3706961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan James Kaye","original_name":"Jordan James Kaye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b33b116510be227fe102d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fd1IYHdwrICNJedm16wfm4KVcCs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
