The sheep, on the ground with their four legs bound, are quickly and skillfully shorn. The animals, now without their fleece, leave one by one, leaping over a narrow channel to allow the shepherds to count them. Everything is crystal clear, efficient, encouraging in a sense – and this goes for both the shearing and the film. Except for the final panning shot of the men grinning at the camera and brandishing shears ready to be put to use. –Andrea Meneghelli","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sheep Shearing in Tunisia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Samama Chikly","original_name":"Albert Samama Chikly","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2af4d41ea6104626dc4f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
