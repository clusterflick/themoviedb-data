Trowbridge's adopted daughter Alice makes every effort to prove Kane's innocence, but to no avail. When Kane escapes from the clutches of the law, Alice works with him to investigate the crime. They soon discover that Judge Hoyt, a great friend of Trowbridge and an ardent admirer of Alice, killed Trowbridge after forging the old man's will to read that Alice would only inherit his fortune if she married the judge. The judge, confronted with the accusation, becomes so unnerved that he confesses to the crime, and all ends happily with Alice in Kane's arms.","popularity":0.249,"poster_path":"/3WpDrFqolrrCwb6KhjG6tvlbDs2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"See This Screen Prima Donna in Her Latest Photoplay, Which is Featured as Usual by the Daring and Advanced Costuming of the Noted Star.","title":"The Mark of Cain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Kainsm√§rket","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Moreno","original_name":"Antonio Moreno","popularity":0.3889,"profile_path":"/swsEgnc8bkILLcOjUDPGtZdXnQs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kane Langdon","credit_id":"67b33212f47a8b922a6db641","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Castle","original_name":"Irene Castle","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/gHHsxjXFNqpLfHB78odcPVdka8T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"67b3321c5b8c789e849fa671","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.H.
