Raising questions like ‘are the things we create in our lifetime the mark of our existance?’ and ‘can the artist escape death trough the art objects?’ the documentary touches a vast variety of themes and ideas as well as paying a visit to one of the oldest mausoleums in ancient mythology, the Acheron River.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/kHOtETKQsUsIsLbZ2FS1f8HIHCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Post
