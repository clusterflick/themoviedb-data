Already in 1782 the Vienna audience was enchanted by the lyrical drama by which the new inhabitant Mozart presented himself as master of opera to the audience of the imperial city. On the one hand, \"The Abduction of the Seraglio\" is a subtle comedy, on the other hand it conveys important humanitarian values: the Europeans captured in an Ottoman palace are not saved by a military attack but by the generosity of the sovereign \"Selim Bassa\" - actually mortal enemy of the Habsburg monarchy which was at war with Turkey in Mozart's time!","popularity":0.3035,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":237290,"logo_path":"/ybY4aLZxf7jcFDizkFTntgTjsQr.png","name":"ZDF/3sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salzburg Marionette Theatre: The Abduction from the Seraglio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Ustinov","original_name":"Peter Ustinov","popularity":1.0841,"profile_path":"/7GHLBhcNCiRugTcUt76HgtkZCUg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67b338c8aaac3b1674e0e6ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1987390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Stanchina","original_name":"Peter Stanchina","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Selim Bassa","credit_id":"67b338d75b8c789e849fa8ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Haefliger","original_name":"Ernst Haefliger","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Belmonte","credit_id":"67b338e5e5e1a7ed7ce0ffcc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2861661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Stader","original_name":"Maria Stader","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Konstanze","credit_id":"67b338ef4e89ccd7886de1df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2095101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Streich","original_name":"Rita Streich","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/d4y7na7WnVLgfM8rORRRkj3rjZe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Blonde","credit_id":"67b338fa4e89ccd7886de1f4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Vantin","original_name":"Martin Vantin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pedrillo","credit_id":"67b33907169e365af69fd381","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2133916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Greindl","original_name":"Josef Greindl","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/jz5kWAHok4ZlCPlSEvqho6pPjoq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Osmin","credit_id":"67b33911a65d6303e7e0dd20","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527497,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ferenc Fricsay","original_name":"Ferenc Fricsay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b3392b41ea6104626dcf97","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1987390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Stanchina","original_name":"Peter Stanchina","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b3393ca40d04bc939fb020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"67b388b4f47a8b922a6dc8aa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379924,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gottlieb Stephanie Jr.","original_name":"Gottlieb Stephanie Jr.","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b388d6a65d6303e7e0ea77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
