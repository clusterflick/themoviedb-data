Miles from shore, the ship got stuck in the ice so the men went over the side to walk to the sealing ground. When a terrible storm struck, they were stranded. It took rescuers 3 days to arrive; by then, 78 men were dead and another 9 missing. This tragic story is told through the words of men who were there and the haunting prints of David Blackwood.","popularity":0.2875,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Just Didn't Want to Die: The 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Webber","original_name":"Timothy Webber","popularity":0.5851,"profile_path":"/Av0mtgZ9DeopXP9NQjzd8q9ZPd6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67b2c9a5a65d6303e7e0d53c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph MacDonald","original_name":"Joseph MacDonald","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2c980be1135c1d86dda59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223497","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
