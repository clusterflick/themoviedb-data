When she came of age, many suitors sought her hand in marriage, but she vowed to only marry one who could beat her in combat. None of them did of course, and Walinong Sari was content to remain single. Her father, however, worrying for the future of Inderapura accepted a proposal from Melaka's royal Bendahara much to the dismay of his daughter. Unhappy of her fate, she decided to travel to Pura on the mighty river one last time to say goodbye to the land she loved dearly.","popularity":0.5531,"poster_path":"/ljDOV2Zbe5LmIvIrH6xqZbcLNlm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ore Struck Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walinong Sari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fatimah Abu Bakar","original_name":"Fatimah Abu Bakar","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":"/ggge96jD3XuvRApOzQUkqB4zLgm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67b2783aaaac3b1674e0cfa6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1297348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Aqilah","original_name":"Nadia Aqilah","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/iNMKmklngcCc984m3I2Kxv8QFOd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Walinong Sari","credit_id":"67b27867aaac3b1674e0cfae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ghafir Akbar","original_name":"Ghafir Akbar","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mambang Segara","credit_id":"67b279246a689eadc06dd6cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2146692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junji Delfino","original_name":"Junji Delfino","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mak Inang","credit_id":"67b278a7169e365af69fbb9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bront Palarae","original_name":"Bront Palarae","popularity":0.4278,"profile_path":"/v4VSF6IPQX1nYfg643POwKKKz4e.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bendahara Paduka Raja","credit_id":"67b278806a689eadc06dd688","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Eusoff","original_name":"Tony Eusoff","popularity":0.2653,"profile_path":"/wV2RB6ZVPCCLmRFWTS2FAl6unGd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Raja Laksamana Petir","credit_id":"67b279659bcf45752ce0c548","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugene Foo","original_name":"Eugene Foo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2772285f576e97d6dcf3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650480,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Honey Ahmad","original_name":"Honey Ahmad","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b277466113c493dc6dbb4e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650480,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Honey Ahmad","original_name":"Honey Ahmad","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b277b56a689eadc06dd614","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251377,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Firsham Aqil","original_name":"Adam Firsham Aqil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b277d1aaac3b1674e0cf82","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Farah Al Amin","original_name":"Farah Al Amin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b278016a689eadc06dd657","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26752484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ljDOV2Zbe5LmIvIrH6xqZbcLNlm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
