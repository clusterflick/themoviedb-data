Recasting Byker as the Wild West, it sits at the porous boundary between fact and fiction, combining recontextualised iPhone clips shot by the riders and archival material from North East Film Archive with Lawson's own footage. What emerges is an intergenerational portrait of this community, incorporating fragments from the 2004 BBC series The Stables (made with teenagers at Stepney twenty vears ago).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stepney Western","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4066545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Lawson","original_name":"Harry Lawson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2ad05317838d2949fab99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
