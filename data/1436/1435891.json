Pierre and Jean Ravier opened the way several decades ago, drawing on the Pyrenean reliefs one of the most beautiful pages of amateur climbing excellence. In three days, climbing and connecting 3 legendary north faces by Ravier on foot is the crazy challenge that Bastien and Jordi have set themselves. 3 days, 3 routes, 85 km of pedestrian connection, to arrive at the end of the north face of the Tour de Marboré in Gavarnie, the Dièdre Jaune du Vignemale and the Embarradère du Pic du Midi d'Ossau.","popularity":0.3056,"poster_path":"/n5tuPzfYdmxsr4ZhW2HsGLUeiNy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253835,"logo_path":"/3M8PnJtI48kfHN1WokVuOZKxkHv.png","name":"AE
