The series begins with Kagome Higurashi, a fifteen-year-old middle school girl from modern-day Tokyo who is transported to the Sengoku period after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half-dog demon, half-human Inuyasha. After the sacred Shikon Jewel re-emerges from deep inside Kagome's body, she inadvertently shatters it into dozens of fragments that scatter across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome set out to recover Jewel's fragments, and through their quest, they are joined by the lecherous monk Miroku, the demon slayer Sango, and the fox demon Shippō. Together, they journey to restore the Shikon Jewel before it falls into the hands of the evil half-demon Naraku.","popularity":0.5252,"poster_path":"/yUyE6qwb1EaKQqxUbYCHomJccGO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155602,"logo_path":"/q01jNfCjC2hiOyyIHOqx0am36CI.png","name":"Nelke Planning","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inuyasha - Stage Play","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2870994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yutaka Kyan","original_name":"喜矢武豊","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":"/oVeqVfpBixmctdNxFU7HsNP36r0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Inuyasha","credit_id":"67b2a1da41ea6104626dc08c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1419901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumi Wakatsuki","original_name":"若月佑美","popularity":0.5071,"profile_path":"/3m8hAG3Su5XHfq2mgq66SDsPH3k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kagome Higurashi","credit_id":"67b2a1e85aca5a71d29fccfe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2794934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroki Sana","original_name":"佐奈宏紀","popularity":0.1972,"profile_path":"/sTaso86KKd15q7R1xxbdj85PNFj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sesshomaru","credit_id":"67b2a1fee9ee3dcc77e0c8df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2247097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junna Itō","original_name":"伊藤純奈","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/4Rn3OQ1fdk1pK6nK1wGYDH0q1gf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kikyo","credit_id":"67b2a21085f576e97d6dd355","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585763,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rumiko Takahashi","original_name":"高橋留美子","popularity":0.3192,"profile_path":"/3C1oodp7PTT1wk4HGewoqgJmR4t.jpg","credit_id":"67b2a25585f576e97d6dd38b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585763,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rumiko Takahashi","original_name":"高橋留美子","popularity":0.3192,"profile_path":"/3C1oodp7PTT1wk4HGewoqgJmR4t.jpg","credit_id":"67b2a28baaac3b1674e0d57d","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5258452,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Takumi Obinata","original_name":"Takumi Obinata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b6aa4e11ff03409ec3dba1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4445535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isamu Kayano","original_name":"Isamu Kayano","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/g40AKPxCyZcjtXOiz9kL21qpH7h.jpg","credit_id":"67b74804e484fc21541a245f","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takumi Obinata","original_name":"大日方琢視","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b748250c61025fafc41cd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33354675","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2262,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/yUyE6qwb1EaKQqxUbYCHomJccGO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1400,"name":"swordplay"},{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"},{"id":196509,"name":"youkai"},{"id":199685,"name":"live play"},{"id":207826,"name":"shounen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Information release source: https://pc.goldenbomber.jp/musics/4576","release_date":"2017-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
