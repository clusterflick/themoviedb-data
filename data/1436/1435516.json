Filmmaker Shahla Riahi (Ghodrat-ol-Zaman Vafadoost) plays the lead role of Marjan, a Roma woman whose doomed romance with a young school teacher has multiple endings, according to key sources. Shot on 35mm black-and-white film with a runtime of 105 minutes, Marjan was the inaugural production of Arya Film Studio, founded by Riahi herself in 1956. Unfortunately, only two reels of the film can be viewed today, preserved by the Iranian film collector Ahmad Jorghanian, while further surviving reels in the Iranian National Film Center remain completely inaccessible. Film scholar Farzaneh Ebrahimzadeh Holasu will present the surviving fragments in person.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marjan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shahla Riahi","original_name":"Shahla Riahi","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/yzbrw2p3krasA72aznchQzsD3Pt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marjan","credit_id":"67b2acf1aaac3b1674e0d765","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2513067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Ali Jafari","original_name":"Mohammad Ali Jafari","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hamid","credit_id":"67b2ad09317838d2949fab9c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shahla Riahi","original_name":"Shahla Riahi","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/yzbrw2p3krasA72aznchQzsD3Pt.jpg","credit_id":"67b2ac46aaac3b1674e0d700","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shahla Riahi","original_name":"Shahla Riahi","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/yzbrw2p3krasA72aznchQzsD3Pt.jpg","credit_id":"67b2ad31e9ee3dcc77e0cb14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251584,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ahmad Shirazi","original_name":"Ahmad Shirazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2ada2317838d2949fabe1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0378329","wikidata_id":"Q14757626","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
