Josh Blue is back at it to tell you about the most embarrassing part of his crushing defeat on Americas Got Talent—and his plan to win next time! Filmed in his hometown of Denver, Blue gives the audience a lesson in how comedy works. He’s a single dad with one good arm and 50% custody of two pre-teens: you do the math! Blue skates the line on topics ranging from his campaign to fix this country’s acid reflux problem to his way with animals. Through his mix of well-crafted jokes and improv, Blue takes some risks with his girlfriend, explains the miracles of botox, and tells the audience how to eat a sandwich. He’s been watching a lot of serial killer documentaries and he’s got a few thoughts on his own death. Blue is well known for his intricate lattice work of call backs and his sardonic, yet charming, self-deprecating humor. He calls out Joe Rogan, Bill Cosby, and homophobic senators in his laugh-a-minute fifth comedy special. Oh yeah, and he still has cerebral palsy.","popularity":0.1773,"poster_path":"/g3CtEsmgY5k7H4FanVcEB9B60f2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185438,"logo_path":"/dfkzQeshEOxf5vATWCPWRovYszg.png","name":"800 Pound Gorilla Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Josh Blue: Freak Accident","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":488207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Blue","original_name":"Josh Blue","popularity":0.2265,"profile_path":"/mACHxy34CedOrOnFFp6gTPNNFE4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b1d6204e89ccd7886db448","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1961651,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John P.
