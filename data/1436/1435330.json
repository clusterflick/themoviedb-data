Unfortunately, most of us will eventually get that call, during which we learn that a loved one has died. It’s devastating and unmooring. In the blink of an eye, life as you’ve known it is irrevocably and permanently changed. But you’re still here and life goes on, whether you want it to or not. How do you pick up the pieces and move forward? Is it even possible? And what, if anything, can be taken away from sudden loss? Take Away explores the realities of this dreaded universally shared occurrence through the lens of a wide variety of ages, backgrounds, and cultural experiences.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":253737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Whiskey
