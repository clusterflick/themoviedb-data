Men exit a mosque. Women and children assemble and the women prepare a meal--smiling and laughing when they notice the camera. A group of men and children emerge with a camel from an underground gallery. A man harvests fruits from a tree. A woman vigorously crushes the fruit with a stone. A child stomps the fruit with his feet inside a container. The people often look directly at the camera while they work. We see the process of their labor production, followed by views of the old fortress, the citadel, and the village. A woman fetches water from a well in a bucket. A donkey raises a ruckus and causes a scene. A small child smiles and nods while holding the side of his head after a fight, indicating that he did well.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picturesque Tripoli","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Samama Chikly","original_name":"Albert Samama Chikly","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2b2885b8c789e849f99ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
