Fusing funk, disco and a do-it-yourself punk aesthetic, rap music quickly became the defining voice of a generation of young, angry and disenfranchised black youth. In this incisive documentary, the history of rap and hip-hop is explored as well as the larger social context of American race and class relations. Interviews with Ice-T, Queen latifah, KRS-One, Chuck D and Rakim explore the context of rap’s evolution and offer necessary defences of the music’s relevance and importance to African-American youth; especially in the context of a popular media that has often dismissed rap as misogynist or “inauthentic”. Made by two Australian brothers who fell in love with the music, this documentary gives a voice to the power, impact, originality and importance of rap and hip-hop.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rap, Race & Equality","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
