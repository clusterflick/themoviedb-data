The pivotal times of the year 1939 both for Estonia and the whole world changed history. The filmmakers examine the events side by side with the memories of the children of the era. Family photos, newspaper cuts, dramatic archival excerpts, memories of elderly people who used to be children at that time - all of this reflect the tragic events of 1939 and the silent destruction of the Republic of Estonia.","popularity":0.1905,"poster_path":"/zFIiRZ1musVIZag0YUxtA5qgeyd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2010-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Surrender","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tambet Tuisk","original_name":"Tambet Tuisk","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":"/9hGX7pDzpiQNmxdA6P3CsZV0MwT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67b209dc5aca5a71d29fb6e8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1595991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liina Triškina-Vanhatalo","original_name":"Liina Triškina-Vanhatalo","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/1y8AXwnu3yc1wMDS4Nf8ybJlUj7.jpg","credit_id":"67b1fb756510be227fe0dd24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595168,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivo Felt","original_name":"Ivo Felt","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/vvzZ32j3zMCnrGt75eK74dpK3Js.jpg","credit_id":"67b209f85aca5a71d29fb70c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiina Kaalep","original_name":"Tiina Kaalep","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b20a056113c493dc6daab8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5250564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Indrek Treufeldt","original_name":"Indrek Treufeldt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b20a23be1135c1d86dc332","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960636,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Meelis Veeremets","original_name":"Meelis Veeremets","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/2KWZ3rknqU6TsFZ0otVIxSfugeO.jpg","credit_id":"67b20a30be1135c1d86dc338","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403027,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mait Mäekivi","original_name":"Mait Mäekivi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/m5LxuFcv4AJVxFveYB3b5xBnMkZ.jpg","credit_id":"67b20a3a6689678bae9fb68b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5250566,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Siim Randla","original_name":"Siim Randla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b20a494e89ccd7886dbd22","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595994,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seppo Vanhatalo","original_name":"Seppo Vanhatalo","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/nRZDNTokmrJqtFJ39ok8KvTg0DY.jpg","credit_id":"67b20a587294be98a8e0e40f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1595991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liina Triškina-Vanhatalo","original_name":"Liina Triškina-Vanhatalo","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/1y8AXwnu3yc1wMDS4Nf8ybJlUj7.jpg","credit_id":"67b20a617294be98a8e0e414","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2857,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/zFIiRZ1musVIZag0YUxtA5qgeyd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
