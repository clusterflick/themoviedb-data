Chikli's camera captures the narrow streets and whitewashed houses. We move to the olive grove, where children in the trees shake the branches and pick the olives. A boy smiles mischievously at the moving camera but we also feel the difficulty and intense repetition of his labor. A donkey carries baskets of olives. Men stand in line on a dirt road to receive their payment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sousse – Olive Harvest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Samama Chikly","original_name":"Albert Samama Chikly","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2b18141ea6104626dc586","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
