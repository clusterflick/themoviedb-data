There is a sensability in it that I am willing to trust to the end, no matter what weaknesses the film contains. The attitude, the feeling is right, and most of the images are right. Strong lyrical qualities. A beautiful merging of personal incongruities and irrelevancies. Good use of superimpositions. The only time the film fails (to me) is in its ovvasional frame freezes which look like infatuations in otherwise healthy lyrical footage.... I find Jon Voorhees a rare new talent and I am looking forward to more of his work\" Jonas Mekas, Village Voice, March 1973","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rivers of Darkness/ Rivers of Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1669724,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Voorhees","original_name":"Jon Voorhees","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b37d585dc988b1bb9fa489","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
