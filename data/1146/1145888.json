The brushstrokes and color effects give his works an incredible poetry. Virtually wordless and often accompanied by a piece of music, they are characterized by the stillness of painting and the constant movement of a camera: an eye that wanders and moves around the image itself, which is therefore constantly changing. Schwizgebel plays with repetitions, circles and references (especially to the areas of film and painting). He has created an exciting work that is worth discovering in the form of this collection - all at once and in chronological order.","popularity":0.0685,"poster_path":"/x3YSJ2vfLtmdznaEKvdoTqPtIeS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio GDS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Poetic Metamorphoses: A collection of 18 animated films by Georges Schwizgebel.","title":"Collection Georges Schwizgebel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Schwizgebel","original_name":"Georges Schwizgebel","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/9hixdcBCCwqYtfc1l7rF7N6WpZa.jpg","credit_id":"64a4349b8e20c5014f2b1c91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Schwizgebel","original_name":"Georges Schwizgebel","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/9hixdcBCCwqYtfc1l7rF7N6WpZa.jpg","credit_id":"64a434abd400f300caacce3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28220630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmL9lzXpeeOh5x5Eyap2ECC9T2Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/x3YSJ2vfLtmdznaEKvdoTqPtIeS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":326771,"name":"georges schwizgebel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"filmo.ch","release_date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
