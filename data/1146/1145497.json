Even if a person sits with the stone for a whole day, it will be just one trillionth of its life. This poetic and beautifully shot film attempts to look at stones beyond the human gaze. It sees them through the prism of St. Petersburg and its granite embankments, the ‘Devil's’ megalith in the Leningrad region and the high mountains of Georgia, where the ancient city of Uplistsikhe is carved into the rock. At the edge of time, this film gives us a glimpse of a world that humankind may never reach.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mineral Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Mineralnye sny","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3652257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timofei Zubrov-Andreev","original_name":"Timofei Zubrov-Andreev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649c06df96386400e3bb843d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4135331,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mikhail Denisov","original_name":"Mikhail Denisov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649c06ebfd4f8000ecb3bbbc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4135333,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivan Asseev","original_name":"Ivan Asseev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649c06fbaf58cb00fffa262a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3652257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timofei Zubrov-Andreev","original_name":"Timofei Zubrov-Andreev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649c070777c01f00ca5a91d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28650981","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
