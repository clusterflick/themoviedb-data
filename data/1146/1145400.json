New to L.A., he answers an ad for a roommate and meets Aron Presley, a young man who believes he is Elvis reincarnated. Confronted with the fact that his own reincarnation is impossible, since he was alive when Elvis died, Aron calmly answers, \"In L.A., you create your own reality.\" After a bizarre interview to be a roommate, Jeff moves in with Aron, and falling prey to Aron's plan, gets blackmailed into an elaborate scheme filled with drugs, sex and blue suede shoes. With more twists and turns than the presidential election.","popularity":1.0776,"poster_path":"/tiW5meRlT5TQxCgxoOxUF5outEE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dream Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In L.A., you create your own reality.","title":"Elvis Took a Bullet","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":170185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Binkley","original_name":"Gregg Binkley","popularity":0.2839,"profile_path":"/je6MyewR0ktccvlS2va6TwikLBa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Jeff Wilkes","credit_id":"649b9afcfd4f8000ecb376de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4135034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Eeten","original_name":"Jerry Eeten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Aaron Presley","credit_id":"649b9b13963864013a3284e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca McFarland","original_name":"Rebecca McFarland","popularity":0.3669,"profile_path":"/b4jJ5eM55DFi2Km97MhyZsVISk3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Polly","credit_id":"649b9b2696386400e3bb33aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.J.
