As the action begins, a woman dressed in the fashion of the time is seen approaching the camera position. She stops in front of the window of a mercantile store. While she is scrutinizing the merchandise, a purse snatcher comes from the rear, grabs her handbag, turns, and makes off with it in the opposite direction. The woman causes quite a commotion, waves her arms and yells attracting a large crowd, including some policemen. The cameraman changed his position and the last scene shows the woman, escorted by two policemen and followed by a group of people, walking down the sidewalk into a building that might be a police station.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":37046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges Méliès","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1905-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"STOP THIEF!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"649b3fdac3926601440d8c09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1905-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
