Like hardly any other artist, she adapted to her respective audience and was thus able to achieve worldwide popularity.  This show revisits her greatest hits and thus becomes a musical border crossing and voyage of discovery that will bring us closer to Dalida in all her musical and linguistic facets for the first time.","popularity":0.1714,"poster_path":"/6qrMuBeJGjzsEgwIvQYH7Cmqbtu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dalida Forever!: The Greatest Hits Over 40 Years","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1210880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalida","original_name":"Dalida","popularity":0.2592,"profile_path":"/rLYOFXncTCbZ8JTz4RG823ccR4A.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64cdd863303c8500c61320b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4196970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Leupold","original_name":"Michael Leupold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd09e4764b9901008a1abf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omoA5vKYJ4ugOTNApm7vZq86i0H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nQbseKwDdJ2OHB9GQO80CcSjQMk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/32Q8AI4HAOZ6qFqC43xUuEQ3XQK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6qrMuBeJGjzsEgwIvQYH7Cmqbtu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1552,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/seVYFAfiSH443LoF5hIHYJaTPhb.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1036},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/HfQTXLMESrEiFm8zM7RZePkygG.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/iRNmyu1gQDWhuwRcKIKlbrmknl2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rHV0IP8f0MYsh5jEs9d6VEjL2Ak.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10229,"name":"singer"},{"id":12990,"name":"singing"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":275101,"name":"dalida"},{"id":302127,"name":"famous song"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
