The main purpose of the tour, organized by Siemens and AEG, was to showcase ICE technology in advance of the U.S. railroad company Amtrak's planned purchase of 26 new high-speed trains in 1994. The new high-speed trains were to replace Amtrak's Metroliner fleet and be used on the Washington-New York-Boston route. They were also planned for use on other corridors.","popularity":0.0877,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":203138,"logo_path":null,"name":"West Glen Communications.
