From the outside, the family looks faultless, a caring, home-proud mother, a bright daughter with an even brighter future and a slightly distant but otherwise perfect Dad. In reality, the Dad isn’t the Dad; he’s an actor paid by the Mum.  His job is to help raise her daughter, begin there to give fatherly advice and provide a traditional upbringing. He does this for multiple families, but a needy client puts his secret at risk.","popularity":1.1838,"poster_path":"/ghuQFzOouztJoKquznGQjAdJEeL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prickle
