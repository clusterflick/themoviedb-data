Kennedy made a visit which would change America and the rest of the world’s perception of Ireland forever. Kennedy referred to his visit to Ireland as “the best four days of his life”. One of those days, June 29th, was spent in Galway, known for its long winding promenade, beautiful beaches and traditional Gaeltacht culture of music, dancing and Irish language. Told through the eyes of residents who were present on the day, the film recalls the euphoric excitement felt within the local community. Nobody in Galway had ever experienced such privilege before, nor had they felt such an atmosphere, and they’d certainly never met someone as famous as the President of the United States of America.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hcdrceKYCgsU5uryF3yIeH8JB7i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203094,"logo_path":null,"name":"PR Pam Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JFK: The Three Miles","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4536768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pam Finn","original_name":"Pam Finn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd4ce1d8af6701878f1e45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4536768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pam Finn","original_name":"Pam Finn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd4d1fd8af6701878f1e77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30811289","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":766,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hcdrceKYCgsU5uryF3yIeH8JB7i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
