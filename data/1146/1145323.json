She began working in the film industry at 19 as a \"cutter\" before the advent of editors, and gradually worked her way up through the studio system. Determined and ambitious, she was accepted as a director at Paramount, as the first woman to direct a talking picture for the star Clara Bow. A true pioneer of the cinema, she was the only woman director at a major Hollywood studio in the 1930s and 1940s, openly lesbian, dressed like a man, making movies \"avant-gardiste\" about women's condition. She was a mentor for Francis Ford Coppola, who considers her as one of the most important woman directors of Hollywood.","popularity":0.1935,"poster_path":"/hCSLGfFIJZA6FrmGByHafpaszh5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy Arzner: Pioneer, Queer, Feminist","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Dorothy Arzner, une pionnière à Hollywood","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Maietta","original_name":"Tony Maietta","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/3OUDrnHOQ5Qd968gixwkXB9XXGG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"649b537cfd4f8000ecb34b14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelley Stamp","original_name":"Shelley Stamp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"649b5392c3926601060abdb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Carman","original_name":"Emily Carman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"649b53a3b1f68d011e4fd32f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1201230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara Kuperberg","original_name":"Clara Kuperberg","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/lpRHLr53m8JEbLiSHD0tnvAhQwk.jpg","credit_id":"660a4907cabfe401652eceea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Kuperberg","original_name":"Julia Kuperberg","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/yeM3pHHaIBfds48y43JpeauNVXp.jpg","credit_id":"660a490e1495650163b993e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1201230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara Kuperberg","original_name":"Clara Kuperberg","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/lpRHLr53m8JEbLiSHD0tnvAhQwk.jpg","credit_id":"660a491674507d0164c30bbd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Kuperberg","original_name":"Julia Kuperberg","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/yeM3pHHaIBfds48y43JpeauNVXp.jpg","credit_id":"660a491dd6dbba017d6f573e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1201230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara Kuperberg","original_name":"Clara Kuperberg","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/lpRHLr53m8JEbLiSHD0tnvAhQwk.jpg","credit_id":"660a492a74507d017dc33672","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Kuperberg","original_name":"Julia Kuperberg","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/yeM3pHHaIBfds48y43JpeauNVXp.jpg","credit_id":"660a493135818f0149389f9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1201230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara Kuperberg","original_name":"Clara Kuperberg","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/lpRHLr53m8JEbLiSHD0tnvAhQwk.jpg","credit_id":"649b53b8e004a60102c3e054","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Kuperberg","original_name":"Julia Kuperberg","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/yeM3pHHaIBfds48y43JpeauNVXp.jpg","credit_id":"649b53d6fd4f80012ed3997c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36048,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yoram Astrakhan","original_name":"Yoram Astrakhan","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/7Dp7GUqCY3AMHowwhS0kcIJOQBv.jpg","credit_id":"67770f39ab5ec4c3dc723da2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29686028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3bh8OJB48HsElftICv5pGvRW7bD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":894,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hCSLGfFIJZA6FrmGByHafpaszh5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":629}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Il Cinema Ritrovato ","release_date":"2023-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
