A man embarks on a journey, his destination a woman living in a tower block on the other side of town. Naked begins with his departure and ends with his arrival at the close of the day. Following him on his journey is a mythical window cleaner, whose flying gantry takes us through the city to a tower block where he spies on a woman preparing for her guest and observes her neurotic next-door neighbours. Naked, which refers to the womenâ€™s vulnerability as well as their state of undress, uses model, drawn and photo animation within three dimensional sets.","popularity":0.1312,"poster_path":"/llKO6UCONhWhUc1qx2isE7pb5Fo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naked","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4135912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yasmine Ramli","original_name":"Yasmine Ramli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649c7068091e62010c10554e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/llKO6UCONhWhUc1qx2isE7pb5Fo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197065,"name":"claymation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
