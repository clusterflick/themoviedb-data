Drawn by her yearning for a love built on romance rather than convenience, Shizuko defies her parents’ wishes to marry into wealth and boldly pursues a relationship with Ching-wen. However, their May-December romance faces challenges beyond age, identity, and societal judgment. Beneath the surface lies a deeper obstacle rooted in Ching-wen’s past. On the beach where love both begins and ends, Shizuko and Ching-wen must confront the weight of history and personal trauma. Can their love transcend the barriers of age, culture, and a troubled past to endure?","popularity":0.2169,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1968-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunset Over the Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulysses Tsai Yang-Ming","original_name":"Tsai Yang-Ming","popularity":0.1625,"profile_path":"/4qAajnKzQV73C7yv7LFPS9Z8PY6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"649c4798b1f68d00af529099","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Ching-Ching","original_name":"Cheung Ching-Ching","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/6VsPOcpiaDbX96zNR8yLIlJhgYN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"649c47a6c3926600c888f94a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chin Tu","original_name":"Chin Tu","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/9NywX6YE7xOcgDenjzAyaLWMZFF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"649c47afb1f68d00af5290a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chou Yu","original_name":"Chou Yu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"649c47b777c01f012dc4d68f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zhou Lan-Ping","original_name":"Zhou Lan-Ping","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649eafc3091e6200cae0bfdf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590717,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lin Tsan-Ting","original_name":"Lin Tsan-Ting","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ljjZaWqfdhcRrdNiViiOx0AvPes.jpg","credit_id":"649c47dcc3926600c888f95b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lin Fu-Ti","original_name":"Lin Fu-Ti","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649c47d1fd4f80014f97e3e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinema at Sea - Okinawa Pan-Pacific International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
