In the context of the war in Vietnam and the cold war, this encounter marked a turning point in Chinese‑American relations. John Adams, a major musical figure of the last forty years, made this event of contemporary history the subject of his first opera. Nixon in China tackles the political thaw instigated by ping-pong diplomacy, begun by the invitation of the American table tennis players by their Chinese counterparts, one year before the presidential visit. A mesmerising work in which the pulsations and repetitions typical of minimalism are combined with melodic lines of great lyricism. For its entry into the Paris Opera repertoire, this work has been entrusted to the director Valentina Carrasco, who underlines the importance and the mediating power of Chinese national sport in history.","popularity":0.5238,"poster_path":"/dpzMVKBZMmvQJ5vz7144sZvC7NH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52114,"logo_path":"/fQkQoS3C8Vpya8tolBXFTL5ZpMW.png","name":"Camera Lucida","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Adams: Nixon in China","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":460831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hampson","original_name":"Thomas Hampson","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/6DGBYLORYO3uKvJrWUCV2rNswbh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Richard Nixon","credit_id":"649d86d05aba3200ffdac6a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":269139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Fleming","original_name":"Renée Fleming","popularity":0.3384,"profile_path":"/7L6CEpZS2eYmKZquDTFTSpEbTiz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pat Nixon","credit_id":"649d86dcc072a200ece43b68","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4137153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiaomeng Zhang","original_name":"Xiaomeng Zhang","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/iBD8UFmsPC7fQZxxzk838cRoY4n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chou En-Lai","credit_id":"649d8728091e62010c10f613","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4137155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Matthew Myers","original_name":"John Matthew Myers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6PCRK2aTWIDgQ1GV7WxSdriAhg5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mao Zedong","credit_id":"649d876b8289a0011cc13977","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1561646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Bloom","original_name":"Joshua Bloom","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sLzG9Ho1v2Ihur9dCZJO3S5m0Vg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Henry Kissinger","credit_id":"649d877a8289a000e2138738","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1681170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Kim","original_name":"Kathleen Kim","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/vSjqpljEwlDCZfielCLt0T6vxkH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chiang Ch’ing","credit_id":"649d87a5c072a200af847b24","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestre de l’Opéra National de Paris","original_name":"Orchestre de l’Opéra National de Paris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self -
