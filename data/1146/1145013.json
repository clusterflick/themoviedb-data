To comprehend how on earth someone could participate in unprecedented mass murder, Orthel enters into candid discussions with SS veterans who were in Auschwitz during the war. These are not the top-level war criminals, but ‘ordinary’ men who often ended up there, rather than choosing this path.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pfq16KKfxZGaFrTkSjTwIQw7zMo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1975-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow of a Doubt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179976,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rolf Orthel","original_name":"Rolf Orthel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a9413fed59700c9b84d3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pfq16KKfxZGaFrTkSjTwIQw7zMo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
