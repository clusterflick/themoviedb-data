Part I begins in St. Louis in 1967 in a pre-Stonewall and pre-Watergate USA, exploring the impetus behind Humphreys “Sociologist as Voyeur” research method — a still radical gesture and one of the first in the Western canon to turn the ethnographic gaze back onto the hypocritical conservative mindset that created it. Why can’t statistics be avant-garde? Part II begins in his Californian office in 1975, where we find Humphreys sweating in a radically different USA on the cusp of republishing 'Tearoom Trade'. Its relevance to contemporary discussions of intimacy, social presentation and data control is delicately carried by visual intensities and rich performances that keep as many secrets as they give away.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/zV6JLcq4tbcbfKBX56a5DYrbzo8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masquerades of Research","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark O'Halloran","original_name":"Mark O'Halloran","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/pSzfJCInot95e4aQDLJAHRVmNFS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"649b07272975ca0144cd27a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2224030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Doan","original_name":"Ivan Doan","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":"/n2nulyEaXAEqfAvTim5ntylzWOS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"649b07952975ca00c882fe1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Watson","original_name":"Ricky Watson","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/fOdEb91ozND436PP5CwfzXLfg1D.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"649b07a9d35dea00ec8f3818","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Fitzsymons","original_name":"Patrick Fitzsymons","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":"/ezWFudDjtplLaogfOmz1sbELEqN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"649b074f0e5aba0139de969a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4134048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Lee","original_name":"Sean Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"649b076cd35dea014dce777f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4134049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Plunkett-Reynolds","original_name":"Ben Plunkett-Reynolds","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3BhxLMVzTqm5uDD7qyxpLLptrRa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"649b077b2975ca00c882fe10","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3585941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Shoemaker","original_name":"Judith Shoemaker","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/qSXo1pShIhhc4B0rwqZKzPHpMgc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"649b0782d35dea00aea812aa","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4051617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Padraig Robinson","original_name":"Padraig Robinson","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649b070c0e5aba00acf24b9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zV6JLcq4tbcbfKBX56a5DYrbzo8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Geelong Pride Film Festival","release_date":"2024-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
