In this book Thomas Moffet exposed insects as entities, each of which deserves to be examined. Here, the theater becomes a chamber, precisely that of the camera where life took place. Where does this mysterious presence come from inside my camera? How is it possible? She seems drawn to the light. Is this the condition of his presence? Camera insectorum is a short poem celebrating the evanescence of light and life.","popularity":0.0464,"poster_path":"/3A0KUPnno0DXh07LG8m0GAAngPb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camera Insectorum - Apis Mellifera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-François Reverdy","original_name":"Jean-François Reverdy","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649bfae7b1f68d00af52677c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3A0KUPnno0DXh07LG8m0GAAngPb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
