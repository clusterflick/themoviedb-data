Since the studio couldn't build an entire film around Wilson's bullwhip prowess, a plot was called for. This time around, it's the one about a U.S. marshal who searches high and low for a mysterious masked desperado. The mystery angle is minimal, since seasoned movie fans will be able to determine the mystery person's identity within 15 minutes. As always, Andy Clyde is a tower of comic strength as Whip Wilson's grizzled old sidekick.","popularity":1.326,"poster_path":"/oJOomO1szkaBjuU0BoooELzbMzH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's a Wizard with his Whip!","title":"Riders of the Dusk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whip Wilson","original_name":"Whip Wilson","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/9JANL28rVRPJGmT2FePAHP6t6oE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marshal Whip Wilson","credit_id":"590f5e6f9251414e89023a7a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Clyde","original_name":"Andy Clyde","popularity":0.2349,"profile_path":"/a2HSCnMfIpLnLCNr6r4gWM8zR6K.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Winks Holliday","credit_id":"590f5e7b9251414e800236eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reno Browne","original_name":"Reno Browne","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/w3yXI3JGS1h7FAiTzHBMh2XVMpZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nora Neal","credit_id":"590f5e88c3a3686519020750","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tris Coffin","original_name":"Tris Coffin","popularity":0.5132,"profile_path":"/6ZHwIj24k7mkJYqcankVbXlKKaD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"J.J.
