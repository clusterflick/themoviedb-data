After losing his brother in a tragic car crash, his mother takes up drinking, and Harwood finds comfort in his best friend -- fellow-nine-year-old Billy, the mentally-handicapped girl from down the street. Together, they watch the famous blimp fly overhead, and craft a \"blimp trap\" to catch it for their very own. They're teased for their special game, and their friendship, until one day, something miraculous happens.","popularity":0.6327,"poster_path":"/7Rx7AUSRIlqUhJMiMLYgUIxhA1V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blimp Trap","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Blake-Thomas","original_name":"Isabella Blake-Thomas","popularity":0.3385,"profile_path":"/7VG2KcXdtHwe6KC5itVzKPaEJA5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"590dc01cc3a36864c600e058","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blaze Tucker","original_name":"Blaze Tucker","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Harwood","credit_id":"590dc02a9251414ead00dd3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Boudreaux","original_name":"Bob Boudreaux","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Stan Stone","credit_id":"5afcdaf10e0a262c99001a42","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1715631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shawn Welling","original_name":"Shawn Welling","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/8BPuaX6cjdxZLXG9rO7pHMYndAE.jpg","credit_id":"590dc050c3a368651900d1b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811555,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miriam Esther Goldman","original_name":"Miriam Esther Goldman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nXpJsurhsD6WltcdX4VAvvGkVmr.jpg","credit_id":"590dc05b9251414edb00e5c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811556,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathan Carliner Goldman","original_name":"Nathan Carliner Goldman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590dc065c3a368651900d1c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4693830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwWjtOoBLCivDQugGr8OKqNIXv6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7Rx7AUSRIlqUhJMiMLYgUIxhA1V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":1556,"name":"texas"},{"id":9928,"name":"bereavement"},{"id":10400,"name":"airship"},{"id":207051,"name":"mentally handicapped child"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE AXI / FEATURE FILM / THE BLIMP TRAP / TRAILER / Director: ShawnWellingAXI","key":"6CenKvGf3so","published_at":"2015-08-13T22:33:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"590dc2ce9251414e9200e79a"}]}}}
