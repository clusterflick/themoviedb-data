But this is no conventional history lesson. Rather, the excerpts chosen contrast a variety of external and often oppositional views, ranging from mainstream Hollywood drama to European art-house. Source material from the US includes Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Forrest Gump, whilst Europe is represented by the works of Harun Farocki, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog and Jean-Luc Godard. The result suggests that any ‘true’ picture of Vietnam has been lost to the multiplicity of symbolic purposes to which the country, its people and their tribulations have been put.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tz1SNM5gcyJok3gtWLWTpxLXned.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vietnam the Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nguyễn Trinh Thi","original_name":"Nguyễn Trinh Thi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/lVX9qOa3uaw4DFoOIDD5ztwiEZa.jpg","credit_id":"5910b4d19251414e8003627a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tz1SNM5gcyJok3gtWLWTpxLXned.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
