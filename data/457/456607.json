After five years, Jennifer West dragged the film along the mud and salt crystal encrusted spiral of Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty before throwing it in the icy pink waters of Utah’s Great Salt Lake—the film’s frames were then digitally photographed and re-stitched together. Through material traces of mud, salt crystals and sand, distant places and layered temporalities flicker across a film that lasts less than one minute.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/earNpXeUQjKzStH0IWSHFzCRj7K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salt Crystals Spiral Jetty Dead Sea Five Year Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1812653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer West","original_name":"Jennifer West","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591017d09251414e9202cb70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6952358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/earNpXeUQjKzStH0IWSHFzCRj7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Excerpt \"Salt Crystals Spiral Jetty Dead Sea Five Year Film\" by Jennifer West, 2013","key":"366026162","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-13T02:23:00.000Z","id":"5eca3a768e2e006074109538"}]}}}
