Erin Gray turns in a commanding, award-worthy\r performance with a portrayal that is disarming in its reality. Kent McCord portrays a man in\r profound conflict, reflecting the best and worst in all of us. Gary Conway's performance as\r artist/attorney, David Merritt, will invoke people to question their own unchallenged truths.\r Marshall Borden brings depth, style and humanity to his role of the inspired playwright.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0229852","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
