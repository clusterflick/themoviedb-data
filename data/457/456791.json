It captures the life and art of the self-taught genius who single-handedly depicted the look and feel of what can be describe as the Golden Era of Hong Kong Cinema from 1975 to 1992.\r Western audiences might recognize some familiar faces from the prolific painter's recent works - undeniably breathtaking - such as the portraits of Marlon Brando, Michael Jackson, James Dean, John Lennon, Audrey Hepburn and Anne Hathaway.","popularity":0.3624,"poster_path":"/ny6PvPVti7nh3n40X6lUtvL3OkB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hui's Film Production Co., Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2016-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Posterist","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuen Tai-Yung","original_name":"Yuen Tai-Yung","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/8pw3gBuDtE9zAXDGdiPLTVOLWB9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ce2b66e0e0a266f81cf4f03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Bee","original_name":"鍾鎮濤","popularity":0.8633,"profile_path":"/jHGQOGPBCggmu764SjysXiH5FNc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5911c32ac3a36864c6043ea3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cheung","original_name":"張同祖","popularity":0.5243,"profile_path":"/4RJ9r6FP6kQUmEUWZylPByh7TtG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5911c3339251414ead041513","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hui Koon-Man","original_name":"許冠文","popularity":1.6873,"profile_path":"/2XATYendB0Pkb27lW3zijK40nQq.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5911c3249251414e800446c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64487,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Chong","original_name":"莊澄","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/du89FDdXNfxyp20afB3tZ1kAOtk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ce2b6a70e0a263f91ca958e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109508,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ma Wing-Shing","original_name":"馬榮成","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/cPd2XQjs2gzBkEtyIqjgVFAsesN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ce2b6d29251412d00bd9b56","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2317215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hui See-Wai","original_name":"Hui See-Wai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/342ryaZ3OrNWLo0JnBOoR2nxyOC.jpg","credit_id":"5ce2b7550e0a265256cee143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8156834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f2kFWT1b87s1KFxuUnO4GjTYp9l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gsy2weWeo9XPekxNfFNBO0rBmrh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGHZ34KYMp6OZ9OOZvGSayO2siX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.866,"height":640,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/78Zi6NDOutSGA4ek6YEDDVdh4ra.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1194}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.689,"height":1100,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/ofal415ANXa30Vgn4VJnLUAqUXk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":758},{"aspect_ratio":0.728,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ny6PvPVti7nh3n40X6lUtvL3OkB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1491}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"I","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"I","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Singapore Chinese Film Festival","release_date":"2017-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
