Elderly ladies rummage through jumble at a sale held by the Salvation Army in Glasgow. 'Jumble sales aren't part of the normal capitalist system, so it doesn’t look quite like a Western Europe in the 21st century. And the music also makes the viewer unsure when or where this is.’","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/lfMNBWBugM37zvUPGyQyy3fpn6n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The States of Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","original_name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/73XYrrsLlb0lGXcVH7fTjfbVDdR.jpg","credit_id":"590e1944c3a36864c6011ce8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","original_name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/73XYrrsLlb0lGXcVH7fTjfbVDdR.jpg","credit_id":"590e194dc3a36864c6011cf2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lfMNBWBugM37zvUPGyQyy3fpn6n.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
