About 50% of the video is the ritual itself, consisting of recitations from their unique liturgy interspersed with vintage hymns.  The text is read by original Process minister Sammy M Nasr and the songs are performed here by the band Sabbath Assembly (Jex Thoth, Imaad Wasif, Kevin Rutmanis and Dave Nuss - obviously taking their name from the ceremony itself).  Following the ritual is a slideshow presentation on the church narrated by original Process member/author Timothy Wyllie and finally a Q&A interview with Timothy conducted by Feral House publisher Adam Parfrey.  So while it's not a documentary exactly, you certainly learn about the history of the church, its practices, and get a good feel of what it was like to be a member.","popularity":0.2701,"poster_path":"/p72gvqm2kNfoG908luZHmUqO0Al.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Process Church of the Final Judgement - A Sabbath Assembly Ritual and Salon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jex Thoth","original_name":"Jex Thoth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59121791c3a36864d4049c15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":75694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imaad Wasif","original_name":"Imaad Wasif","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591217b8c3a368646b04c545","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Rutmanis","original_name":"Kevin Rutmanis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591217d59251414eca045779","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1813579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Nuss","original_name":"Dave Nuss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591217dd9251414e92048567","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Wyllie","original_name":"Timothy Wyllie","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/yoSlaktbDeqnqp0imhfTSHbJ6Y4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591217f3c3a368650a0458ba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Parfrey","original_name":"Adam Parfrey","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/vnF89DPN2WyztRsaVxaKyMamrXq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591218019251414e8d045d6f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammy Nasr","original_name":"Sammy Nasr","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c482e2cc3a368478c88518d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2224440,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary Ann MacClean","original_name":"Mary Ann MacClean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c482d029251410e22532fbd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Wyllie","original_name":"Timothy Wyllie","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/yoSlaktbDeqnqp0imhfTSHbJ6Y4.jpg","credit_id":"5c482cecc3a36847778843dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":550261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genesis P-Orridge","original_name":"Genesis P-Orridge","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c482d61c3a368477a888398","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2224439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert de Grimston","original_name":"Robert de Grimston","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/rNu0df3BgJTkntuyVHV9fZslwZi.jpg","credit_id":"5c482cddc3a3684782885450","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":933,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p72gvqm2kNfoG908luZHmUqO0Al.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
