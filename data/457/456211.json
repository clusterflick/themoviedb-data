The staged scenes are based on an original script by the artist and focus on the conversations of a married couple who work for the same food multinational – a cross between Nestlé and Monsanto. Their exchange is inspired by theatre and television, where socio-political analysis is played out through everyday, familial dialogue with large doses of humour, hypocrisy and violence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hVicMflddzUlSx3fK9v9LEHY6TX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mouthfeel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maryam Jafri","original_name":"Maryam Jafri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590d11c89251414e8d004af6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hVicMflddzUlSx3fK9v9LEHY6TX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":837}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
