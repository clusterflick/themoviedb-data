Interspersing a selection of these images with excerpts from Schamoni’s films such as \"Es\" and \"Chapeau Claque\", Schamoni’s photographer daughter Ulrike Schamoni and editor Grete Jentzen have created a loving tribute to a generous and multifaceted man.","popularity":0.1158,"poster_path":"/dAPLqboPAWAz4adXSBbGNF2DLfW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abschied von den Fröschen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrich Schamoni","original_name":"Ulrich Schamoni","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/npFsZRhPOJ0Wz2x6Fva4w8yemwO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"590c2d7ec3a3680148008c86","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Schamoni","original_name":"Ulrike Schamoni","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590c2d25c3a36801a6008d62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810633,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Grete Jentzen","original_name":"Grete Jentzen","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590c2d4dc3a3680148008c74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2214775","wikidata_id":"Q331967","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":827,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dAPLqboPAWAz4adXSBbGNF2DLfW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":552},{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":761,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/5skSbfiJAIcdsjqiO8iSlsEG8pi.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
