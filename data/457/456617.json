Loosely based on the Adrian Lim ritual murders in the early 1980s, the film was shot and produced in Singapore. It was the debut filmmaking effort for its executive producer, Errol Pang, and it has been credited with reawakening Singapore's local film scene. In the movie's ending, the main character based on Adrian Lim escapes from prison and runs into an incoming truck, where Satan catches him and subjects him to eternal torture â€“ this was said to be added to suggest to the audience that crime does not pay.","popularity":0.2036,"poster_path":"/9Lh5PEArfutHPp6mtwjzBJW6mNn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Derrol
