To quote a Cuban comedian: “where does the Cocuyo hide its battery?”, just thanks to its peculiarity, Desiderio uses this cockroach as a perfect metaphor to describe his protagonists:  with their green lights during the night and virtually impossible to find during the day. In his movie, he tries to find the battery of the Cocuyo living and looking for the “day-time” part, creating a path made by portraits and with an anti-narrative style. These scenes are far away from the Electronic music, or partly at least; all in a very natural context and without a defined screenplay.\r http://www.coocuyo.com/","popularity":0.4318,"poster_path":"/qMREQLPTI5swVDO53nre6TNg6iW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198303,"logo_path":"/ntBtNP2c2M5yJYQHh8isbKoJj91.png","name":"ElectroWish Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where does the Cocuyo hide its battery?”,","title":"COOCUYO","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/rGRCRAuGXyaragWOcAIyaoAywj5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"screenstory","credit_id":"5d56e549e8131d3e338bbfac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/rGRCRAuGXyaragWOcAIyaoAywj5.jpg","credit_id":"5d56e3ca4bc38b60d224dd02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fPe3WdgTp5aNncVRSlDrqRy2ow9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qMREQLPTI5swVDO53nre6TNg6iW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":701,"name":"cuba"},{"id":186117,"name":"dj"},{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"},{"id":217489,"name":"techno music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"COOCUYO - Trailer (2017) | Directed by Desiderio","key":"QkicF59mHug","published_at":"2017-05-18T06:53:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59a18381c3a36847c502d42e"}]}}}
