They quickly became close, sharing a city that they had never been to: Smyrna, in Turkey. Joana’s paternal Greek family were forced into exile from Smyrna by the Turkish armies after the end of the Ottoman Empire. Etel’s Greek mother was also born in Smyrna and was married to a Syrian officer of the Ottoman Army and exiled in Lebanon after the fall of the empire.  Etel and Joana have both lived in an imaginary Smyrna, today called Izmir, without ever setting foot there. Nowadays they are confronted with the transmission of history and trauma, questioning their attachment to objects, places, imaginary constructions and mythologies without images. What is to be done with the sorrow of our parents? Their personal experiences, their stories serve as a background to the region’s changes after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the evolution of the borders questioning the notion of identity and belonging.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":"/kYe97lrsNlEiTYccygmdeBLEti1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ismyrna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Hadjithomas","original_name":"Joana Hadjithomas","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"590b9510c3a368623f0007de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Etel Adnan","original_name":"Etel Adnan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"590b9522c3a368623f0007e8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Hadjithomas","original_name":"Joana Hadjithomas","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5910b3319251414e8d0345ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khalil Joreige","original_name":"Khalil Joreige","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5910b3409251414ead03396f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kYe97lrsNlEiTYccygmdeBLEti1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
