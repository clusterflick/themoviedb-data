Sten is a 30- year-old librarian. Over a book he meets supersexy Katja, the woman of his dreams, and they soon end up in bed together. It's love at first sight, but the next thing he knows, Katja wants money every time they make love. Otherwise their relationship will become trivial, she says. Reluctantly Sten agrees, but then Katja puts up the price.","popularity":0.485,"poster_path":"/nnTmUpQMU69hhaJP0pdhvZ8lBU7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1789,"logo_path":null,"name":"M&M
