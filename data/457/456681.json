Based on real events, and drawn from thousands of pages of judicial documents, the work employs the so-called landscape theory (fukeiron in Japanese). The character's paths to radicalism are rendered purely through a series of landscape shots filmed at the locations traversed by the subject: a biography determined not by what the subject did, but by what the subject saw, and one that questions how these landscapes reflect the social and political structures that are the backdrop for a journey of alienation and return.","popularity":0.4034,"poster_path":"/64tDvQofzUhFNfZ76gK2kbI2rbx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poulet-Malassis","origin_country":""},{"id":76612,"logo_path":"/kE6mXnRHkS3bHpu1hikx1U1pFyo.png","name":"Spectre Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Also Known as Jihadi","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Baudelaire","original_name":"Eric Baudelaire","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/w1VxVJbFm7fBT5ib9Z27zfDOM3E.jpg","credit_id":"62ed9ed6c4ad59007a149cda","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Baudelaire","original_name":"Eric Baudelaire","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/w1VxVJbFm7fBT5ib9Z27zfDOM3E.jpg","credit_id":"5910b6779251414e89036e60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090814,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claire Mathon","original_name":"Claire Mathon","popularity":0.16,"profile_path":"/7XKSrvs8awkwXFL8GgQ8gxwBWEq.jpg","credit_id":"5b22cc78c3a36813ab021307","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064774,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alan Guichaoua","original_name":"Alan Guichaoua","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b22cc95c3a36813d501eea0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1270678,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claire Atherton","original_name":"Claire Atherton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b22cc9fc3a36813c301f28f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7136528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nyAIfzTWW6mbzaFDpe3WH2OY6So.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/p9iIpO4GLbBL6lqGmTYGNUDIJPv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/64tDvQofzUhFNfZ76gK2kbI2rbx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4743,"name":"jihad"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
