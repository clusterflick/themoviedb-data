He thus presents several cases to prove his point. In one of them a supposed to be planter and businessman who underpay an employee gets framed by his own folks. A young boy, jump from a high tree with an open umbrella to copy the way the parachutist do in the city. A few other examples are as pathetic or comical. At the epilogue our storyteller finds himself being laughed at, at a bistro in Paris. The way he deals with the situation is kind, and again humorous.","popularity":0.1195,"poster_path":"/1iawYYJBsFIoyHVGfDxhoRUYJzu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Histoires drôles et drôles de gens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dikongué-Pipa","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dikongué-Pipa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cCaYtWrOqsS2Q5rcQcDW0bGPaQA.jpg","credit_id":"5912571c9251414ead047595","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0085680","wikidata_id":"Q3138277","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1iawYYJBsFIoyHVGfDxhoRUYJzu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1983-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
