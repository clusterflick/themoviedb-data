Each year about 240.000 young men are called to do their military service in the French Armed Forces. They remain in bases both in France and in French overseas territories, the film will be projected throughout these multiple installations. The 'on camera\" interviews by Depardon were authorised without any form of restriction by the military authorities, selecting a scattering of young men from all walks of life who will spend 10 months under the flag. They were each free to give their own personal opinions related to the Aids problem, without any form of censorship.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/gcG5AA4QMUXXmyiPcUM49x1wZYL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palmeraie et Désert","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10323,"logo_path":"/uMlnpzZGM0rWxp69JU5cuAQEJbB.png","name":"Gedeon Programmes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sida propos (ou Paroles d'appelés)","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Depardon","original_name":"Raymond Depardon","popularity":0.1365,"profile_path":"/hYNHPXItm5ELS49dspIMDPoxRzh.jpg","credit_id":"590c6c719251415a4d00c029","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gcG5AA4QMUXXmyiPcUM49x1wZYL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":505}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1994-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
