It is also a very personal film since the subject is the grandmother of one of the co- directors. The idea is interesting as it links one strong clear memory, told several times, to other fragments and truths of her condition. Animation is sparingly but cleverly used to complement the delivery and avoid it just being a talking head.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/s9ssZ5cZ77XmNdGycIP1FnO7xXT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isabella","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Cowles","original_name":"Duncan Cowles","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/pNAF80vI40LZCTWOXRubCfceSbj.jpg","credit_id":"590beca1c3a3680196003d8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Hogg","original_name":"Ross Hogg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/sexDbFA2SOeUXoQYUxBEiFSvXFE.jpg","credit_id":"590beca9c3a36801c6003ea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5105450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pLQ8mBKbysi8AiQvaJVQnXEcUeF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s9ssZ5cZ77XmNdGycIP1FnO7xXT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
