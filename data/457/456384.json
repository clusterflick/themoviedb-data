One night this poet becomes too bold in his advances and is thrashed by the man who has been rejected. On a later night, the group holds a party in a dirigible. The ship crashes and fear grips the revelers. Mary, now disgusted with the group and all it represents, mends her manner of living and plans a future with the man who has always sincerely loved her. A lost film.","popularity":0.1836,"poster_path":"/6U3cJpoyRzx78uvY5sFpNZs9Wnn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42184,"logo_path":null,"name":"John McCormick Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Moderns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Moore","original_name":"Colleen Moore","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/zWnl0isnoRAUCOmZmYvJMqo8FBk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mary Sundale","credit_id":"590e3087c3a368651901195e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mulhall","original_name":"Jack Mulhall","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/4r33PICmACJZ2Bjum0v1EkvOxbx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"John Ashler","credit_id":"590e30959251414ead012741","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Miller","original_name":"Carl Miller","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/bt3pDOt4rcUJQvt61MlHqYQzBgh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Oscar Pleat","credit_id":"590e309e9251414eca01290a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Gillingwater","original_name":"Claude Gillingwater","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/9AMgwHyCDNveG6AkQvp8hQN0xgN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sir Robert Sundale","credit_id":"590e30a99251414eca012917","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarissa Selwynne","original_name":"Clarissa Selwynne","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/jrm9O5lWXqYOOsEw0DH3ovuHz0H.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lady Kitty Sundale","credit_id":"590e30b1c3a36864fc012ea3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelle Corday","original_name":"Marcelle Corday","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/lNZi5U11Sa2RctHfgOZqu3VN1Oq.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Theodosia","credit_id":"590e30bb9251414e92013437","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Payson","original_name":"Blanche Payson","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/xROiHT5bhgQgeibssJTa4Oox4X5.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Johanna","credit_id":"590e30c59251414e92013444","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Francis Dillon","original_name":"John Francis Dillon","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/8WWebUUEfcpcTvUNhFAeeoPRQbR.jpg","credit_id":"590e30239251414e85013221","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Israel Zangwill","original_name":"Israel Zangwill","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590e30529251414e8d012bf1","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"June Mathis","original_name":"June Mathis","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":"/kiwwEYmnN6r3kEitWWah8iH8oGW.jpg","credit_id":"590e305a9251414ead01270a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371854,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John McCormick","original_name":"John McCormick","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590e30669251414ead012716","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ted D.
