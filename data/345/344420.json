Setting an ambush at the crossroads, he kills the musician Jedediah Graham before the man can sell his soul. Chasseur then lies in wait for the Devil. Instead, the blood-soaked Chasseur encounters the Devil's lawyer, weaselly Mycroft Coney. What follows is a biblical battle of wills between the brutal, conscienceless Chasseur and the fast-talking Mycroft. Mycroft fights for his life as Chasseur pumps him for information on the Devil. Eventually, Chasseur gets what he wants... and more.","popularity":0.2027,"poster_path":"/qGIzz8vpueZVDTNgqMLHFCE5Zmi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasseur","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","original_name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/nosNARTf1EF5yv8p7arLpfaELyk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Louis Chasseur","credit_id":"6402b023136545009e7aeba2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":943154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Bitton","original_name":"Joshua Bitton","popularity":0.5165,"profile_path":"/d5N7kvWXwmQctqmVNvdOB6UxYsK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mycroft Coney","credit_id":"6402b03a67dcc900826dae56","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","original_name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/nosNARTf1EF5yv8p7arLpfaELyk.jpg","credit_id":"64e661eb7d5db50100949b63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","original_name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/nosNARTf1EF5yv8p7arLpfaELyk.jpg","credit_id":"64e663071feac100c46d2096","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","original_name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/nosNARTf1EF5yv8p7arLpfaELyk.jpg","credit_id":"64e663ac1feac100e168df3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","original_name":"Christopher Soren Kelly","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/nosNARTf1EF5yv8p7arLpfaELyk.jpg","credit_id":"557b45969251417b13000166","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2464748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5NLPbJRBKRHDhD72m4oxdQppbQw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qGIzz8vpueZVDTNgqMLHFCE5Zmi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
