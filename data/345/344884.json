The program started with the memorable scene of a camel caravan crossing the desert against the setting sun, with Kitaro's music and a sense of timelessness. It was the start of an epic televisual poem.  The first journey described in the series began in Chang'an (now Xi'an), at the eastern end of the ancient route. On 450,000 feet of film, the NHK crew recorded the path westward to the Pamir Heights at the Pakistan border and this material was edited to make 12 monthly broadcasts. In response to viewers' requests that the series be extended to cover the Silk Road all the way to Rome, sequels were made over the next 10 years. Seventeen years after the program was conceived, the project was completed.","popularity":0.3419,"poster_path":"/vVrCPaEFkIZ8zJxnx7mE0bqnFOs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":540,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silk Road","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1024812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":952,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vVrCPaEFkIZ8zJxnx7mE0bqnFOs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":272284,"name":"silk road"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
