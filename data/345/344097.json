His peroxide blond hair sticks in all directions; he's dressed in a skin-tight, short, off-one-shoulder, sparkling dress that he says he got from the Queen, who wouldn't wear it. The set includes Gang Bang (the name-game song), Jungle Jezebel, Born To Be Cheap, Alphabet Rap, Native Love, Shake It Up, and, for an encore, Shoot Your Shot. The band, whom we never see, is techno-rock. Between songs, Divine chats up the audience, usually talking about sex.","popularity":0.2407,"poster_path":"/1iXQKHJOxU83GZeRihzNFHWfVRR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divine: Live at the Hacienda","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Divine","original_name":"Divine","popularity":0.3447,"profile_path":"/kIAg5nYey3uY6rzRYAOpxHNBs8P.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55782811c3a368396c002337","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Divine","original_name":"Divine","popularity":0.3447,"profile_path":"/kIAg5nYey3uY6rzRYAOpxHNBs8P.jpg","credit_id":"629ef6b285005d00acae3dfa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Whitehead","original_name":"Malcolm Whitehead","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5578281e9251413e3e00180a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0233585","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1iXQKHJOxU83GZeRihzNFHWfVRR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":824,"name":"drag queen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
