Dobner becomes acquainted with the Japanese Nakahito and the Indian Fakír Arkaj and inducts them into his plan. The Fakír wants to demonstrate that he can bring a dead person back to life and suggests to his companions that he could attempt to bring Koloman back to life enabling them to ask him directly for the formula. In order to do this he needs a young, healthy male. Nakahito finds a young rake, Marcel, who has squandered away his fortune and now contemplates suicide.
