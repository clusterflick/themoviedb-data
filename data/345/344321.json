Richard, a 10-year-old boy who lives with his grandparents, has an attachment to a soccer ball as if it were his best friend. Every where Richard goes, so goes the ball. As time progresses, the ball develops different blemishes as a result of their activities together. We are reminded that inanimate objects can have memories as well; maybe just in the form of a scratch. 'The Little Boy and The Ball' is a simple story with a simple moral, a friend is a friend no matter the person or the thing.","popularity":0.1069,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Boy and the Ball","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Marie Gomes","original_name":"Ann Marie Gomes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"557a40969251417f74000b66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gomes","original_name":"Michael Gomes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grandfather","credit_id":"557a40b09251417f6c000bad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Welsh","original_name":"Adrian Welsh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"557a40c69251417f7e000c89","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damian Marcano","original_name":"Damian Marcano","popularity":0.1172,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557a40599251417f7a000c3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Richards","original_name":"Aaron Richards","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557a406f9251417f7a000c48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1795677","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
