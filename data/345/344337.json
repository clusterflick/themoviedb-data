He is willing to marry her but his stern aunt wants him to marry a rich girl. To separate the lovers, she arranges for her nephew to be enrolled at a university in a distant town. She then has Anna sent away to live with Torgus the coffin maker and his mother where she will be secluded until the birth of the child.

Meanwhile, Anna anxiously awaits John's return.","popularity":0.2762,"poster_path":"/agHGEHfP2AqND9txEDjroMANCjP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centaur-Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1921-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torgus","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Torgus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerd Fricke","original_name":"Gerd Fricke","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"John","credit_id":"557a60a5c3a368034d0011fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdinand Gregori","original_name":"Ferdinand Gregori","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Vormund Johns","credit_id":"557a60b69251417f7e001312","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugen Klöpfer","original_name":"Eugen Klöpfer","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/ix8iib5AjtyQRbSIMx3j0CNRc9Q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Torgeir","credit_id":"557a60c0c3a368035f0012b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1476430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marija Leiko","original_name":"Marija Leiko","popularity":0.1253,"profile_path":"/nwG20qyrKVEqYtABrzL3ytRkzIV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"557a60c9c3a3680365001230","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1476431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaethe Richter","original_name":"Kaethe Richter","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gudrun","credit_id":"557a60d3c3a368035f0012bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele Sandrock","original_name":"Adele Sandrock","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/fMRJoHuvEXH6tnuy1VtGqOrCORc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Turid","credit_id":"557a60dcc3a368034f001280","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermine Straßmann-Witt","original_name":"Hermine Straßmann-Witt","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Groah, die Hebamme","credit_id":"557a60e69251417f7e00131f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanns Kobe","original_name":"Hanns Kobe","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557a606dc3a368035f0012a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2792,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Mayer","original_name":"Carl Mayer","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7963d39251412a664843ba","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karl Freund","original_name":"Karl Freund","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/radUQdNeGHtn7vhQOTnHBVPH2vE.jpg","credit_id":"5c7963df9251412a694846ea","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48026,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert Neppach","original_name":"Robert Neppach","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c79640bc3a36844d4193632","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48026,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert Neppach","original_name":"Robert Neppach","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7964109251412a574838ba","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0012771","wikidata_id":"Q124463018","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9HNpBbOZACpVZexbafjfeD4H8O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/agHGEHfP2AqND9txEDjroMANCjP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6bkunyS33ypolWDEzT6rH3aHwBn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":244516,"name":"german expressionism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"(Cinemateca Portuguesa)","release_date":"1981-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
