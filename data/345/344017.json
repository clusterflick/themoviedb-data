He is not bad either at chatting up girls. Indeed, since his blonde wife left him, Germain has seduced no fewer than four brunettes. And as, besides being a ladies'man, he has a heart of gold, Germain is unable to break up with any of them, hence a complicated sentimental life. But this delicate balance is threatened the day an outraged stranger comes to him and orders him to leave his wife alone. One small problem is that the man has forgotten to specify the name of the lady in question. So, which of his four mistresses - Christine, Sophie, Anne-Marie or Sonia - should he leave?","popularity":0.2999,"poster_path":"/hSeQWcMO857gtkBZAmuO86TQ5gP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Is the Brunette","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lamoureux","original_name":"Robert Lamoureux","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/6wxszGlL9EzlxBSliiTyJ5RJa58.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Germain Vignon","credit_id":"5b83fef50e0a26459904157a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Fabian","original_name":"Françoise Fabian","popularity":0.4731,"profile_path":"/3qXMNrdnibaKfwt5IfaQYiTfGqm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Christine","credit_id":"5b83ff1992514159e003ce2c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Mercier","original_name":"Michèle Mercier","popularity":0.6102,"profile_path":"/bktgqSJAuD3MQoJl8fomncfWpef.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5b83ff28c3a368656303f0b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginette Pigeon","original_name":"Ginette Pigeon","popularity":0.12,"profile_path":"/1vEta4vrDM22RYeXkEoQfFHbeWZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anne-Marie","credit_id":"5b83ff380e0a26458f0406d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Perrette Pradier","original_name":"Perrette Pradier","popularity":0.2193,"profile_path":"/yUXGyURHWxdPkZDvkbTJmQS757T.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sonia","credit_id":"5b83ff470e0a26458c03fb3a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Alers","original_name":"Christian Alers","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/cyMVWXxdWnHKK3FCkBUETwCWlC0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Louis Sabatier","credit_id":"5b83ff550e0a26458903e48d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","popularity":0.4033,"profile_path":"/yrCA8WtOZUwzY5EK0kmlEpgBgid.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cauteret - l'inconnu","credit_id":"5b83ff630e0a26459c041954","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34630,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre Tchernia","original_name":"Pierre Tchernia","popularity":0.2436,"profile_path":"/uW0WbE8SYZyp3DvdKRWPaf9imVa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Guissauguet - le client","credit_id":"5b83ff71c3a3686558051827","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Robert","original_name":"Yves Robert","popularity":0.2294,"profile_path":"/lv3f0e23sHuZ3B1KFb98nRe3WYR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Le mécanicien","credit_id":"5b83ff7f92514159e003ceb9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Rollis","original_name":"Robert Rollis","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/33zLRUmvjb0wKyywEe91t1yWXyh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Un mécano","credit_id":"5b83ff8ec3a368654e03a445","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":548347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Luccioni","original_name":"Micheline Luccioni","popularity":0.286,"profile_path":"/hNwXOozkxAExr61NR16CRxP0v4v.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Paulette","credit_id":"60d50cf59979d20073eb0c88","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lamoureux","original_name":"Robert Lamoureux","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/6wxszGlL9EzlxBSliiTyJ5RJa58.jpg","credit_id":"5b83ffb0c3a368655b03fe96","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lamoureux","original_name":"Robert Lamoureux","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/6wxszGlL9EzlxBSliiTyJ5RJa58.jpg","credit_id":"5b83ffa30e0a26458f040734","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0053678","wikidata_id":"Q3206909","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hSeQWcMO857gtkBZAmuO86TQ5gP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":722}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
