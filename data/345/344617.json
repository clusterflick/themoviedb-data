It’s a recording of her No. 9 theatre tour, on its closing night at Carré, when she played the concert to a fully-booked auditorium at the theatre.  The audience is treated to a glittering performance which is a potent mix of both music and theatre. Electronic sounds and spectacular beats go hand in hand with a classical string ensemble and delicate piano pieces.  Alongside the No. 9 repertoire in English, and two tracks in Dutch, ADEM UIT and DE WERELD BEWEEGT, the track list also includes four new tracks: SLOWLY, AS THE LADY WALKS ALONG, UNDERNEATH and SOFT SUMMER SYMPHONY.  Special arrangements and orchestration by: Joost van den Broek.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wende - Carré","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1415725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wende Snijders","original_name":"Wende Snijders","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/75QAYJEtd4y4lclHKKt76ush6Y8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"561a0eb792514111c3001aae","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
