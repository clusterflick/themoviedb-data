It is obvious from their reactions, particularly the cook (Leo White) that whatever was said did not go down too well.  His animated arms knock down the man standing behind him repeatedly until all three servants simultaneously quit.  They storm off into the adjoining kitchen where a slavery maid (Blanche White) is on the floor scrubbing the floor.  The men all trip over her, moan briefly and then leave.","popularity":0.3885,"poster_path":"/29s9rDF6BDnPqXJV9Ogy7niR1MY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91633,"logo_path":null,"name":"King Bee Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chief Cook","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Globe Hotel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy West","original_name":"Billy West","popularity":0.1211,"profile_path":"/fIqELek2UAdkPyVmDf92dngGcC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Star Boarder","credit_id":"5579e13ec3a3680354000039","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Ross","original_name":"Bud Ross","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/mz7mUJh4dKnqgGi4dDE5ZNpc2z7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Boggs (as Budd Ross)","credit_id":"5579e14d9251417f7600004d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":1.0454,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Babe (as Babe Hardy)","credit_id":"5579e1569251417f70000041","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cohen","original_name":"Joe Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5579e1629251417f7a00004f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo White","original_name":"Leo White","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/pKJDApReiE0EVmmkTYbHNW7d1Yu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ham","credit_id":"5579e16dc3a368035f000048","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche White","original_name":"Blanche White","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Maggie","credit_id":"5579e17bc3a368035100003b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Bailey","original_name":"Polly Bailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"(as Polly Van)","credit_id":"5579e1809251417f6c000043","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethelyn Gibson","original_name":"Ethelyn Gibson","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The soubrette (as Ethlyn Gibson)","credit_id":"5579e18ac3a368035b00004e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2067708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Burford","original_name":"Ellen Burford","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dolly","credit_id":"5b292269c3a36847c200679a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Bordeaux","original_name":"Joe Bordeaux","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Hotel ex-employee","credit_id":"5b2922950e0a2659be00642c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1373414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence McLaughlin","original_name":"Florence McLaughlin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Hotel Guest","credit_id":"5b2922a5c3a36847b6006738","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arvid E.
