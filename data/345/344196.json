It is a tense and cleverly off-kilter drama, well performed and astutely thought-provoking. It makes great use of its Yorkshire locations, creating a tense and memorably intriguing atmosphere.","popularity":0.2061,"poster_path":"/eHILoeiYSXCRwqU5Vqcvmc32WXV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Incident","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruta Gedmintas","original_name":"Ruta Gedmintas","popularity":0.6318,"profile_path":"/ArRuSKwJJwr3venBPjwoukApa8j.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Annabel","credit_id":"58725c82c3a3684f1601807f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Hughes","original_name":"Tom Hughes","popularity":1.1914,"profile_path":"/ykxpfnJ5Fm0Zrx3MbE7yjRzF0b4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"58725c96925141355b0175b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1286399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tasha Connor","original_name":"Tasha Connor","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":"/4PBijiyybLh0deLaKPRp2WRCnV3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lily","credit_id":"58725cc0c3a3684f160180b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381386,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jane Linfoot","original_name":"Jane Linfoot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557984bac3a3687c1e001123","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381386,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jane Linfoot","original_name":"Jane Linfoot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58725c6892514135690188f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3970806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":831,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHILoeiYSXCRwqU5Vqcvmc32WXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
