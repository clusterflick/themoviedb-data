Aged only 16, Duncan had already showcased his filmmaking talents on a series of award-winning short pieces made for Fair Go's annual programme devoted to commercials. With DFK6498, he channels his recent experiences into a short, stylishly-shot memoir of incarceration, frustration and freedom lost. The film went on to win a trio of awards at Wanganui's River City Film Festival and win praise from director Peter Jackson.","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":"/zep33mELXz8flJDXTyjFTAIrDJk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2004-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DFK6498","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477697,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cameron Duncan","original_name":"Cameron Duncan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"557f732dc3a36871b6000502","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477697,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cameron Duncan","original_name":"Cameron Duncan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f73119251412f1d0004d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477697,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cameron Duncan","original_name":"Cameron Duncan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5789119f9251411e2900293c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361032,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rhys Duncan","original_name":"Rhys Duncan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578911e4c3a36819170026ef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085793,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew McDowall","original_name":"Andrew McDowall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67864cda1fc0ec7f087b07b9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0857369","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":816,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zep33mELXz8flJDXTyjFTAIrDJk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2658,"name":"new zealand"},{"id":10163,"name":"cancer"},{"id":40895,"name":"illness"},{"id":168939,"name":"knee injury"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DFK6498- Cameron Duncan","key":"FBlgSeYktB8","published_at":"2007-07-31T01:16:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"57883181c3a368391900375e"}]}}}
