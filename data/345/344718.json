The film begins with old timer, Dinny (some say he knows too much for an outsider) telling the story of the Kelly Gang to a visiting sketch artist. His tale unfolds as Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne surprise the constabulary in the bar of the Glenrowan Hotel and Ned shoots a constable in the hand.  The Glenrowan Affair includes the ambush at Eleven Mile Creek, the hold up at the Jerilderie Bank and the siege at the Glenrowan Hotel where Ned, dressed in a suit of homemade armour, taunts the 'traps' in a hail of gunfire before he is shot and captured.","popularity":0.5355,"poster_path":"/niwioylIXrViiR2sT6VTYMfhep3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Action","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1951-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Glenrowan Affair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Chitty","original_name":"Bob Chitty","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ned Kelly","credit_id":"557f22129251411e540008ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albie Henderson","original_name":"Albie Henderson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Joe Byrne","credit_id":"557f222b9251410a32002727","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Fernside","original_name":"John Fernside","popularity":0.1342,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Father Burnside","credit_id":"557f225f9251415c4f000031","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Fernside","original_name":"John Fernside","popularity":0.1342,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Father Gibney","credit_id":"557f2268c3a36821b00029fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma King","original_name":"Alma King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kate Kelly","credit_id":"557f227cc3a368219c0025ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Tingwell","original_name":"Charles Tingwell","popularity":0.3269,"profile_path":"/bCUk3KCGDetXBxuxArbaXGlQQWT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"557f22d8c3a36821b3002a83","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3007747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Crowe","original_name":"Ben Crowe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Dan Kelly","credit_id":"604b81de1d78f200577d2a3d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124113,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Ezard","original_name":"Alex Ezard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f22eb9251410a2a002766","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Kathner","original_name":"Rupert Kathner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f22a0c3a3681bcd000003","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Kathner","original_name":"Rupert Kathner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f22b3c3a36821b3002a7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0043589","wikidata_id":"Q7736766","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8EJCvEulp30JPfOqJgwgymLwUCa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/niwioylIXrViiR2sT6VTYMfhep3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235485,"name":"ned kelly"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
