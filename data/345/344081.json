The film was screened only at Warhol's art exhibits. A fan of the Batman series, Warhol made the movie as a homage. Batman Dracula is considered to be the first film featuring a blatantly campy Batman. The film was thought to have been lost until scenes from it were shown at some length in the documentary Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis.","popularity":0.7417,"poster_path":"/ojwjE3B8JOyLTyX7Y9XgvTBm9W0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
