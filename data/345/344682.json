In February 1942, inking, painting and technicolor photography were completed for \"Clair de Lune\" as a short subject, but it was not released. In 1946 it was edited , reshaped and re-scored as the popular music sequence \"Blue Bayou\" in \"Make Mine Music\".  Previous attempts to recreate \"Clair de Lune\" were frustrated by missing animation and Stokowski footage. A nitrate workprint of the original version located in 1992 has allowed \"Clair de Lune\" to be completely reconstructed as Walt Disney intended it to be seen.","popularity":0.117,"poster_path":"/hPUk47JzJVPWpJPcDLY77sENVNb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clair de Lune","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leopold Stokowski","original_name":"Leopold Stokowski","popularity":0.1296,"profile_path":"/yQfjAXLKUMwWPwijDBsbs0zIPIS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5eb5326e7ac8290021228dbe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208002,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Armstrong","original_name":"Sam Armstrong","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557e93fb9251410a350018b6","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Armstrong","original_name":"Samuel Armstrong","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/vC3pN4n1JHuQS8uugo7E1aFW6Mm.jpg","credit_id":"5eb5328a0cb3350021c9a11f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hPUk47JzJVPWpJPcDLY77sENVNb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":2440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3U6CNIrhAUa44mSsFc9fevfpqeP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Originally Completed","release_date":"1942-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Video premiere","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
