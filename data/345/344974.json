The frame rate is then decelerated to the standard 24fps for presentation. The film emphasizes each gesture, sway and flare of flame as the small pinewood carrier ignites across the landscape of the filmstrip and screen, signalling the drama and poetics of this ”minor” event before the fire is extinguished. One also stands as an unassuming beacon, immortalizing on film the essence of some of Ono’s early concerns as an artist. At the slightest touch of fire, they burst into flame. Strike everywhere. Strike often.","popularity":0.613,"poster_path":"/3R5MEIcO1JrT4XsYiFbNe70JUtB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1966-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fluxfilm No. 14","title":"One","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Match","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lighting Piece","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"No. 1","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Ono","original_name":"Yoko Ono","popularity":0.4298,"profile_path":"/j254dQthJu2rR1DRXqRkvo1oUqN.jpg","credit_id":"5581a9bc92514178ff00004c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1359669,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Moore","original_name":"Peter Moore","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3f1e419251415318aed284","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0271086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qfxDZHATWpQxYD6hLaNcSmkNtQ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3R5MEIcO1JrT4XsYiFbNe70JUtB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5564,"name":"match"},{"id":657,"name":"fire"},{"id":18512,"name":"slow motion"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"1966-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
