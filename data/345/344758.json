Relatively obscure, the sport was brought to the mainstream in 2003 with the news of Aron Ralston who had severed his own arm while trapped in a canyon. Experiencing an overnight spike in popularity by the late 90s - a result of information appearing on the internet - the sport became inundated with thrill-seekers of all backgrounds and skill levels. Facing a new era of off-the-couch recreationalists, three influential participants, a canyoneering instructor, pioneer, and guidebook author each respond to a growing interest in the incredibly dangerous activity. Gorging employs the story of canyoneering to examine larger questions about the pursuit of thrills and the consequences that follow.","popularity":0.466,"poster_path":"/uha902FOd62ywPQwJcMnUpE69Nb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55615,"logo_path":null,"name":"DFS Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let's Go Canyoneering","title":"Gorging","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Kelsey","original_name":"Mike Kelsey","popularity":0.0501,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - The Guidebook Author","credit_id":"557f60ec9251412f20000267","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Cabourne","original_name":"Steve Cabourne","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - The Recreationalist","credit_id":"557f60fec3a36871b600026f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Turville","original_name":"Dennis Turville","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - The Pioneer","credit_id":"557f61f89251412f1a0002b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Carlson","original_name":"Rich Carlson","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself - The Founder of the ACA and Instructor","credit_id":"557f6243c3a36871ad00025c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477688,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Olliver","original_name":"Brian Olliver","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f600cc3a36871b3000259","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477687,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Devashree Shivadekar","original_name":"Devashree Shivadekar","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f5fa6c3a36871ab000252","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477693,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Greg Reeves","original_name":"Greg Reeves","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f6285c3a36871b6000280","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477688,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Olliver","original_name":"Brian Olliver","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557f62a9c3a36871ab000280","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2499028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uha902FOd62ywPQwJcMnUpE69Nb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10084,"name":"rescue"},{"id":8122,"name":"canyon"},{"id":10685,"name":"escape"},{"id":5303,"name":"utah"},{"id":1262,"name":"mountain"},{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":10349,"name":"survival"},{"id":159880,"name":"boulder"},{"id":201712,"name":"climber"},{"id":201713,"name":"isolated"},{"id":201715,"name":"hikers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
