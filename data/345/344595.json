She leaves her current residence to retreat to her provincial French hometown. Here she dreams of locating and rekindling an old love. Seyrig is less inscrutable here than in her debut feature-film appearance Last Year in Marienbad (61), though the character is just as complex and difficult to please. Grain of Sand was released in France in 1983 as Le Grain de Sable.","popularity":0.0983,"poster_path":"/iJ0ZBh5iJ9hWzpCsb3d9TEfHbzS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1579,"logo_path":"/otPDzB7wHCUsDH0BzKy3DQ7sTWP.png","name":"FR3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":179331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre Méditerranéen de Création Cinématographique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grain of Sand","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphine Seyrig","original_name":"Delphine Seyrig","popularity":0.6249,"profile_path":"/y9dTKRclY0UviYD5OuINL51tue7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Solange","credit_id":"557d924f9251411e57001cd0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Aumont","original_name":"Michel Aumont","popularity":0.3459,"profile_path":"/4hplpAVRi4nxSTWwQcmH2Ok2AXF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Maurice Leger","credit_id":"63bca9f45be00e00937d55eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geneviève Fontanel","original_name":"Geneviève Fontanel","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/eALr12gY1ut5SFL6VhZJ3XUulzu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Huguette Pommier","credit_id":"63bcaa115be00e008c12722f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Artur","original_name":"José Artur","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":"/5M5Zq2XEJAH6UaNnXk6fXptw9tO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lucien Pommier","credit_id":"63bcaa2df8595800ae3348ae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Roüan","original_name":"Brigitte Roüan","popularity":0.1823,"profile_path":"/tXqmCIkqEp8sI6cnfokNrSsLl05.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"63bcaa48a6e2d200a86693fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuelle Debever","original_name":"Emmanuelle Debever","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/4tEIuxzCAw8alWyTosncLxDRs75.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Starry-eyed girl","credit_id":"657abec47a3c52010cdf90fd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477158,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pomme Meffre","original_name":"Pomme Meffre","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557d923292514153b0003d0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477158,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pomme Meffre","original_name":"Pomme Meffre","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557d92289251411e57001cc8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine K.
