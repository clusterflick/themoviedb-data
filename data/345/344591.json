With food and money running out, the children retreat into a world of their own where, cloaked eerily in black-and-white, their home turns into one of bugs and mysticism – they make saucepan gardens, they take on insects as pets and spiderwebs encroach. Only the friendship of an odd young homeless man gives Jonas hope to survive in an adult’s world.","popularity":0.3502,"poster_path":"/wEtw1SylMnZ2YlNUSaiAjCqJ72g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20276,"logo_path":"/o32RqN5s3TZKz4VCKBI1WCmMQxk.png","name":"TELLUX-Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiderwebhouse","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The
