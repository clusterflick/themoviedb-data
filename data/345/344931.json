Blue plums, bananas and coconuts - none of this was SNOP. No SNOP was all the sweet, mild, sour, sticky candy a child's heart could desire. We meet Hjalmar Bue and Hurry Harry Olatyggis and Zorro at the cinema in a Bergen 50s, still marked by rationing and shortages. This is a animisjonsfilm based on a story by Stig Holmås.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/dvd6gd0fuGLOUtmFFsyEDKEghw2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1991-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Candy","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stig Holmås","original_name":"Stig Holmås","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"55816402c3a368164b001b69","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Konings","original_name":"Jan Konings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7d77258efd30078a66d84","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125180,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jørgen Knudsen","original_name":"Jørgen Knudsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7d7b7b0ba7e00574b666c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Konings","original_name":"Jan Konings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"558163edc3a3681645001c61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3618448","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dvd6gd0fuGLOUtmFFsyEDKEghw2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
