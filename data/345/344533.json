The film chronicles the journey of (fictional) misguided market researcher John Wooley (played by Second City alum Brian Shortall) as he attempts to sell ISPs' vision for what they call a \"faster, cleaner\" Internet. However, learning about net neutrality from several (non-fictional) people in the process, he ultimately opts to re-consider his standpoint.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Internet Must Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3480748","wikidata_id":"Q16251894","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
