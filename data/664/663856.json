My parents are getting divorced, my beloved grandmother is pestering me about the meaning of life. Mishka is a good guy — he loves Varka very much, but he doesn't understand a lot. Having not received the documents, she leaves for the city to her sister. My sister has a big new apartment, a good husband and a dear family friend — neighbor Vissarion Arkadyevich. He is a doctor and everyone loves him. He helps Varka to enter the institute, but she has neither documents nor knowledge. My sister is very worried. And Varka gets a job in a hospital, where he can often see a doctor and be with people. When Vissarion Arkadyevich is transferred to Leningrad, Varka returns to the village.","popularity":0.408,"poster_path":"/apm1dobh7yzHNQoJD0dFcavY9se.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":149,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Twig in the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":272487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Melikhova","original_name":"Ольга Мелихова","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/1FW6M8LkomRMRpKdpxDcSAB3GCm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Варя","credit_id":"5e1e33f8d9f4a60017999bed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":549036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Porokhovshchikov","original_name":"Александр Пороховщиков","popularity":0.2714,"profile_path":"/sEREqGc1XXYnpMsF8yAR3WKutf4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Виссарион Аркадьевич","credit_id":"5e1e340e66751d0015bdc8d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":626381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrey Dudarenko","original_name":"Andrey Dudarenko","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/nrpIGrqeWT7PtPzGG4fBb8moanA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Прохор Федосеевич","credit_id":"5e1e341c66751d0015bdc8df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1942801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Lebedkova","original_name":"Tatyana Lebedkova","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/iYg6ZEKr7z0nmu9pk9jftMRociM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Надя, сестра Вари","credit_id":"5e1e342c5c071b0011624895","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Mikhaylov","original_name":"Viktor Mikhaylov","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/iPC9Lx1bfdu5ztZkOD7DFgf6Sx3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1e346a5c071b001362481f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Pizhel","original_name":"Сергей Пижель","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1tfMbHbj4tagz81x7k5fyFXfjWC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1e34815c071b0016624085","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2444122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevgeniya Volkova","original_name":"Евгения Волкова","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/5KRt5bmnPSxf9QsaPXmTHGVm2IK.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"","credit_id":"668018c8b57235ed6efef812","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197598,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eduard Shim","original_name":"Eduard Shim","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/AwrlZcjQA2qA8rRe2sKYJSAlbYd.jpg","credit_id":"64c2e9f008354700c4a03b4c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Georgi Markov","original_name":"Georgi Markov","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/fnHqeC58yCSX6asMnpIfH0CKsbQ.jpg","credit_id":"64c2e9f9b4224200ace9786e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1832645,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yuri Vorontsov","original_name":"Yuri Vorontsov","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/jFTw9WxIB0cSjyGaVx83jcpbMyR.jpg","credit_id":"64c2eba93520e800ff641c45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225721,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Georgi Kropachyov","original_name":"Георгий Кропачёв","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/hTNIBByHGbIMTzmH8XJlHw0cjXv.jpg","credit_id":"5e1e359266751d0011bdcc0b","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Aristov","original_name":"Виктор Аристов","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/rDrXVJbIv7DkgM6Gl0hsjiCXnE9.jpg","credit_id":"5e1e34d85c071b00116249c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0232855","wikidata_id":"Q4463808","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/apm1dobh7yzHNQoJD0dFcavY9se.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
