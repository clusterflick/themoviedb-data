The recording took place before the Royal Family at London's Royal Albert Hall and before a packed house of Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen. Red tosses off jokes, one-liners, and works through elaborate pantomime routines both classic and new. Highlights include Skelton's uproarious \"Guzzler's Gin\" routine, his \"Fisherman and the Little Boy\" mime, and his heartbreaking \"Old Man Watching a Parade.\" Additionally , he mimes a scarecrow and an old golfer. His legendary rapport with audiences is clearly evident here.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Skelton: A Royal Command Performance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Red Skelton","original_name":"Red Skelton","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/mW8nmbbswhAkEQd2YJ0VA7JGooO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e1aa592e194b00012b4ed04","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1913727,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ken Griffin","original_name":"Ken Griffin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1aa5bae7c097001752760c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0369882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
