Cassini-Huygens spent more than 13 years in wildly varied orbits around Saturn, allowing the spacecraft to pass near many of its moons, as well as execute a soft-landing of its Huygens lander on the moon Titan. By mission end, it accumulated a mountain of imagery and scientific data that will continue to be studied for years to come. This film is a testament to the amazing efforts of the scientists who planned and executed the mission. It combines breathtaking images, movies, and a variety of animations to take the viewer into Saturn's complex system of rings and moons, as well as stepping viewers through some of the more exciting scientific discoveries made over the course of the elaborately complex mission.","popularity":0.4281,"poster_path":"/dkXM3ghDQaconZ1pBVJisYEPprv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kingdom of Saturn: Cassini's Epic Quest","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9061412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dkXM3ghDQaconZ1pBVJisYEPprv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1432,"name":"nasa"},{"id":4165,"name":"saturn"},{"id":9882,"name":"space"},{"id":287067,"name":"science"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
