This film, after a brief introduction from the director, is not intended to glorify violence, but only to show the reality. Images of surveillance cameras showing shopkeepers being threatened with weapons, amateur videos of Colombian drug trafficking, executions and skull collections are shown here. As the film progresses, one sees various deformities of newborn and unborn babies. The film concludes with a hip hop music video.","popularity":0.1744,"poster_path":"/sYwCpwKIlMPIZsUoCuQXH5yOgsn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4708,"logo_path":"/k1zjOZ0GIZ1dxGerINlXC3lGAqh.png","name":"Brain Damage Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Shockumentary for the 21st Century","title":"America the Violent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Facez of Death 2000","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Gesichter des Todes 2000","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3410441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Stone","original_name":"Dave Stone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6275793ff96a39009c947a4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3539005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Stafford","original_name":"Dan Stafford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62757950848eb9005059bfce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3539006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Campbell","original_name":"Karen Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62757960713ea6009b883de8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo Munoz Jr.","original_name":"Lorenzo Munoz Jr.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6275791bd236e60066e1480a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0421595","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1434,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/eZMIMgk6GnoYElQpSnmtmWzLsbA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":956},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sYwCpwKIlMPIZsUoCuQXH5yOgsn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":196543,"name":"mondo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
