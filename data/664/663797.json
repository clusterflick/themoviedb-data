It’s a tribute to disobedience and desertion — in both digital and physical-real warfare. Shot in the picturesque war landscapes of «Battlefield V», the hyperreal graphics become the backdrop for an essay-like narrative. The film revolves around the history of deserters — a part of human history, which has hardly been illuminated. Performances and creative interventions explore the scopes and limits of the audiovisual entertainment machine.","popularity":0.1301,"poster_path":"/IBPCCHTBnCigl8OYgPoUQW9bRo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Total
