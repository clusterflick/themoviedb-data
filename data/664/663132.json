At least 2,500 bears live on the island and the animal is regarded as the worldâ€™s biggest land predator, reaching an impressive four meters in height when standing on its hind legs.  Film maker Stefan Quinth spent three years filming the Kodiak Bear and the wildlife of Kodiak Island. His film is a dramatic story about bear and salmon, beavers and eagles. But it is also a film about the thrill of meeting the giant bear eye to eye in its natural habitat.","popularity":0.2428,"poster_path":"/aQue3UASNwOIlL4iUHISFOLXQqr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kodiak: Island of the Great Bear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fascinating Animals: Kodiak Bear","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Faszinierende Tierwelten: Kodiakbaren","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Fraser","original_name":"Eugene Fraser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e1ae9493520e800153532f8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Quinth","original_name":"Stefan Quinth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1ae9206c19ea0011920a2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Coles","original_name":"Phil Coles","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1ae9356c19ea0011920a4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":884,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aQue3UASNwOIlL4iUHISFOLXQqr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/29a2fLuitHWYL20Po0usvsLWwN0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3593,"name":"wilderness"},{"id":6533,"name":"kodiak bear"},{"id":9880,"name":"alaska"},{"id":10468,"name":"bear"},{"id":190899,"name":"american wilderness"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD Release, specific date unknown ","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
