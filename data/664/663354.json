Or the hairy, 800-pound validation of his life’s quest. It’s also a sympathetic insider’s view of taxidermy as an under-appreciated art form. And finally, it’s a call to preserve the last wilderness. Because when there is no mystery left in the deep, dark forest, we’ll have lost more than Bigfoot.","popularity":0.0678,"poster_path":"/zo814axzJfM1cBQPACUOPDazXe2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If World Champion taxidermist Ken Walker can't find Bigfoot, he'll make one.","title":"Big Fur","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Wayne","original_name":"Dan Wayne","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bd0666a300b00165d2f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Langworthy","original_name":"George Langworthy","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bd0800e29a20019f6b1f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7112214","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zo814axzJfM1cBQPACUOPDazXe2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Virginia Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
