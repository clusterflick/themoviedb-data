Born in 1889, Nazira ascended the throne of the Moukhtara palace in 1923, following the assassination of her husband Fouad and the resignation of her brother Aly Joumblatt. She presided over the region as Lady of the Palace for twenty-five years while raising her son Kamal, preparing him to take his place in a long line of Jumblatt leaders. Famous for her wisdom and strong personality, Nazira boldly entered the Lebanese political scene at a time when this field was entirely dominated by men. Unwavering, she contributed to maintaining peace and stability in Lebanon for many years, earning the respect of men and women, whether Druze or Maronites.","popularity":0.4069,"poster_path":"/wLiHE0eSyjBs4O1nQfOMxGvPFE7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11574,"logo_path":"/rgUiPgpxE7oKPFgU3GEirqAWEXx.png","name":"MISR International Films","origin_country":"EG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lady of the Palace","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2510602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazira Jumblatt","original_name":"Nazira Jumblatt","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e1ee105e559370013240e5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1962956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamal Joumblatt","original_name":"Kamal Joumblatt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4CjPpZ7idmrfABknzyJm0suRDni.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e1ee10e5c071b001163d3c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fouad Jumblatt","original_name":"Fouad Jumblatt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e1ee160e5593700172484d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2510610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda al-Atrash","original_name":"Linda al-Atrash","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/fWysrz2ztt1y4FpBPDifPretgHL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e1ee5d35c071b001663ca53","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381139,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marianne Khoury","original_name":"Marianne Khoury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c843829383500e1112332","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510614,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roland Daou","original_name":"Roland Daou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1ee9cdd9f4a600179afbbb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510616,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charbel Rouhana","original_name":"Charbel Rouhana","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1ee9f1e559370013242d23","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510617,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Touma","original_name":"Richard Touma","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1eea035c071b001663d38e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Georges Ghanem","original_name":"Georges Ghanem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1ee9b55c071b001663d32b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510615,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roy Lteif","original_name":"Roy Lteif","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1ee9de5c071b001663d359","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Habchi","original_name":"Samir Habchi","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/pgXXifxnbBa1lfOWWlg3doXEKdM.jpg","credit_id":"5e1ee99e511d090014830877","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Habchi","original_name":"Samir Habchi","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/pgXXifxnbBa1lfOWWlg3doXEKdM.jpg","credit_id":"5e1ee995d9f4a600179afb24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0794307","wikidata_id":"Q6470715","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Wy96oQ3PmAUexA04cllgjRoG2Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wLiHE0eSyjBs4O1nQfOMxGvPFE7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3J3RfZC4EfwViSIKs902SqsHptQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":295448,"name":"lebanon"},{"id":326807,"name":"nazira jumblatt"},{"id":326808,"name":"kamal joumblatt"},{"id":326809,"name":"woman politician"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
