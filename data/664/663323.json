We barely notice the prehistoric traces and the contours of the spaces, but we hear all the better: drops of water that have for ages been recreating the shape of the cave and continue to do so to date, as well as echoes of human footsteps. Rubio punctuates this soundscape with memories of the speleologists and revolutionary songs that denounce Franco's dictatorship. A journey through space and time.","popularity":0.0506,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ojo Guareña","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508464,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Álvaro Alonso de Armiño","original_name":"Álvaro Alonso de Armiño","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb36fd5dbc20013f27673","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508465,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Elchardus","original_name":"David Elchardus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb380e194b00012b67c62","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2508468,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Fernández","original_name":"Hugo Fernández","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb3abd5dbc20013f27778","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126616,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franco Piscopo","original_name":"Franco Piscopo","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb41cd5dbc20013f27a79","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508471,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Cinel","original_name":"Andrea Cinel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb4356a300b00135cf66c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988363,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charo Calvo","original_name":"Charo Calvo","popularity":0.0624,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb3e36a300b00115ce80e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508463,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergi Gras","original_name":"Sergi Gras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb3573520e80017365808","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edurne Rubio","original_name":"Edurne Rubio","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb338e194b00012b67a94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edurne Rubio","original_name":"Edurne Rubio","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb391d5dbc20013f276f9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513460,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jan De Coster","original_name":"Jan De Coster","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb3cfe194b00016b67602","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edurne Rubio","original_name":"Edurne Rubio","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb3be3520e800173659a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508470,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josja van Zadelhoff","original_name":"Josja van Zadelhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb4030e29a20019f673fb","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988363,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charo Calvo","original_name":"Charo Calvo","popularity":0.0624,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1bb3f06a300b00135cf5d9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
