Through the eyes of the local Aboriginal Employment Coordinator, Joe Ross, we take an informal journey into the world of the Bunaba tribe, their lives, their culture and the modern infrastructures they are developing to make their community both financially and culturally viable. One thing that has long united the Bunuba people is the fight to stop their beloved Fitzroy River from becoming a massive dam project. We gain an inkling into the enormous spiritual and economic losses at stake for this remote Kimberley town.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2000-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Willigan's Fitzroy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warwick Thornton","original_name":"Warwick Thornton","popularity":0.222,"profile_path":"/lbeXa9X4Pxf8FEy9ugXnspdMysG.jpg","credit_id":"646df3e99661fc015736b638","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
