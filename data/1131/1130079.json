Through the breathtaking natural environments of France, it is an exploration of the pyramid of life. It is also, and above all, an opportunity to marvel at these species capable of a thousand feats, subtly connected to each other and of which the human being is an integral part. A link that we have too often forgotten and that it is time to reweave.","popularity":0.7506,"poster_path":"/8KRxakducMSRbB9J6Ay3CtKPng2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hope Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22764,"logo_path":"/8MvPL85VXyoa1BE9Li2s5VTTH3N.png","name":"Calt Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vibrant","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Arthus-Bertrand","original_name":"Yann Arthus-Bertrand","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/oeIMYmpav5yWsihrkizHR80gtY2.jpg","credit_id":"646b8a4a33a376011ec4edda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694905,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laurence Buchmann","original_name":"Laurence Buchmann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b8b4f54a09801728aca4a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3876504,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc Giraud","original_name":"Marc Giraud","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b8b6054a09801386514a9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20682,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Armand Amar","original_name":"Armand Amar","popularity":0.174,"profile_path":"/kLYTExohdrXXcscsEGNiAnqI2fI.jpg","credit_id":"646b8b7354a09800e410353f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2634484,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Rémi Dupouy","original_name":"Rémi Dupouy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jjcOCNEyU6AJ6VmSzlXQl4XE9YT.jpg","credit_id":"66f97ff5a6293e3d76a2520a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28697550","wikidata_id":"Q118612369","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":767,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/101KBS5foiZdeyRcmlLiGFvNizn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1364}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/umUGe62oBaaz1vmnYMZbTHA3fIB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8KRxakducMSRbB9J6Ay3CtKPng2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":3711,"name":"animal species"},{"id":206708,"name":"forces of nature"},{"id":213784,"name":"mother nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":258541,"name":"biodiversity"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":284176,"name":"animals & nature"},{"id":292816,"name":"return to nature"},{"id":301061,"name":"environnement et nature"},{"id":305903,"name":"animal documentary"},{"id":311156,"name":"science and nature"},{"id":328438,"name":"resilience of nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France Télévisions","release_date":"2023-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
