She has recently come out as bisexual, much to the confusion of her manager Claudia who wants the best for her favorite (and only) employee. When June’s childhood best friend, Nia, wanders into the gas station unexpectedly, they recall a memory of a moment that changed the course of their lives – for better and for worse. Through reconnecting with Nia, June realizes that her actions, words, and emotions do have an impact. This discovery hurdles June into a long awaited coming of age.","popularity":0.0915,"poster_path":"/f55Qu24teniYFf8n2pf17rgAK7s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A queer bilingual film about two childhood best friends reconnecting over a memory that changed their lives forever.","title":"June","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julia Ribas","original_name":"Julia Ribas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rhKL7OoFj5zXpsVhEKZB45wQMxL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"June","credit_id":"646d325ac3514c2b09b40f03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nemi Brooks","original_name":"Nemi Brooks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nia","credit_id":"646d3269706b9f011bb4844b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rae Rodriguez","original_name":"Rae Rodriguez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Claudia","credit_id":"646d32759661fc011d95390c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julia Ribas","original_name":"Julia Ribas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rhKL7OoFj5zXpsVhEKZB45wQMxL.jpg","credit_id":"646d32c554a09800fead2a7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077453,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Justin Marquez","original_name":"Justin Marquez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d333c9661fc01573667f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Stevens","original_name":"Lauren Stevens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d329b9661fc01573667bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077445,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karima Karkori","original_name":"Karima Karkori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d32ae33a3760158dba76e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Gaspar","original_name":"Joanna Gaspar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d330dc3514c2b0852253d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3041024,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ale Amato","original_name":"Ale Amato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d334a51e6ab0100843140","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288174,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ziggy Jaz van Koeverden","original_name":"Ziggy Jaz van Koeverden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d331fa5046e01474ec95d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077446,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amy Lyn Williams","original_name":"Amy Lyn Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d32b8c3514c2b06889e7d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21480100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":918,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f55Qu24teniYFf8n2pf17rgAK7s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
