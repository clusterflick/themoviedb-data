Just as men wear makeup (camouflage) as a means of survival to hide their appearance from enemies in war, women wear makeup as a means to survive by highlighting themselves in a patriarchal society. To express this concept, the author cites a camouflage scene in a war movie in which male soldiers perform in the dark. Both male and female makeup and camouflage are related to the survival of society. The work employs a strategy of recontextualization by quoting and transforming the conventional Hollywood movie images (Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, 1987), and transposing them into a colorful make-up scene. As the title of the work shows, the image of a man’s face disintegrates over time and evaporates solid masculinity and dichotomous gender differences into iridescent light.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell to Mr. Arnold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Du-jin","original_name":"Kim Du-jin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d7909a5046e012469b03b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
