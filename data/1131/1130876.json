In his pocket was found a poem, this \"dernier poème”, dedicated to his wife. But actually it is largely the same as the last stanza of a poem, “J'ai tant rêvé de toi” from Corps et biens, published in 1930. The film had traced a voice of Robert Desnos in modern cemeteries.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8tWf5k2xfU251p2LVPBCRD8Uxey.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2015-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Poem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3941608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rhee Hun","original_name":"Rhee Hun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646dbc6c54a09801386623a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8tWf5k2xfU251p2LVPBCRD8Uxey.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARKIPEL 2015","release_date":"2015-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
