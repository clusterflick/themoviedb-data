The story is set just prior to the 2001 Foot and Mouth outbreak in Dumfries and Galloway. It is seen though the eyes of a teenage girl, Fraoch, whose journey through a diagnosis of epilepsy takes place within the walls of an adolescent unit in the South of Scotland. The film unfolds through prose written in East Ayrshire Scots, where Fraoch converses with a horse spirit named Storm. She is presented with visions of the impending crisis only when she experiences seizures, which allows her to connect with her​“second sight”, an ability to predict the future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Erms Of Clay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
