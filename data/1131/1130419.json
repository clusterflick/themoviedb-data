Not limited to records and clubs, the New Beat lifestyle was marketed to death with all sorts of fashion items, a plethora of accessories and…erotic videos.  Erotica, sensuality, and sexuality have always been part of New Beat’s DNA, but our jaws still dropped to the floor when we first laid eyes upon an erotic New Beat VHS deadstock gathering dust in a forgotten video store in the middle of nowhere in Switzerland.  So we did what every New Beat fan would have done, we watched the video and cringed at its low budget production values while we were transported to 1989 Belgium, with the bodies, poses, styles and backdrops you’d expect from that bygone era.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3dt3YTFQTsceLDSZyRgTDOtQyBu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erotique New Beat - Lost New Beat VHS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3dt3YTFQTsceLDSZyRgTDOtQyBu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
