Produced by Anne Hamburger’s En Garde Arts, Father was a Peculiar Man showed how brilliantly Reza applied his specific site-based approach that he developed in Los Angeles to New York City’s urban infrastructure. One of the goals of En Garde Arts’s site-specific journeys through New York’s Meatpacking District was to use the local architecture as a theatrical set while at the same time evoking and playing with the history of the place. The half-deserted cobblestone streets south of Chelsea enhanced the play’s nineteenth-century references. The neighborhood’s past as both a meatpacking and transportation hub via the High Line trains as well as a former center for after-hours sex clubs merge as perfect background for Reza’s spectacular tableaus of gluttony and lust.","popularity":0.502,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father Was a Peculiar Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Tom Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.1685,"profile_path":"/7OUqO0jvZfm5tSEWT6Cscooqsdp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"646d45332bcf6700e3bc9dc2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3098437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Pearl","original_name":"Tom Pearl","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"646d453e54a09801728bb01b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliana Francis","original_name":"Juliana Francis","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"646d4554c3514c2b074271b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Torn","original_name":"Tony Torn","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/dqu7CzsqSgFu2USNGl5oSNoiqHB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"646d4567c3514c2b0688a28d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677569,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ken Roht","original_name":"Ken Roht","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"646d458051e6ab011db4cdf8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077730,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mira-Lani Oglesby","original_name":"Mira-Lani Oglesby","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d45ffc3514c2b0688a2b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Torn","original_name":"Tony Torn","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/dqu7CzsqSgFu2USNGl5oSNoiqHB.jpg","credit_id":"646d45ac706b9f00fe545138","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Abdoh","original_name":"Reza Abdoh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d459aa5046e0189431899","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Abdoh","original_name":"Reza Abdoh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d461051e6ab013ab9948e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077732,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miestorm","original_name":"Miestorm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646d463ea5046e012469986b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285695,"name":"theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Reza Abdoh’s Father was a Peculiar Man at the Segal Center on Thursday 11 May 2023","key":"-JW9qTYwBZg","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-15T22:15:53.000Z","id":"646d46efa5046e016838a68b"}]}}}
