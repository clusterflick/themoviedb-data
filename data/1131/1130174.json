The project pairs composers and filmmakers to create short films with new music for live orchestra. The film and music in “Rise Again” were created through improvisations and feature an intimate repetition that layers individual experiences with community. It tells the story of four mothers who face eviction and raise their children with love and fortitude. The concept emerged from four unique experiences that resonated deeply with each other, as if the women were sharing their own stories. The film was created collaboratively with women supported by Upward Bound House.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rise, Again","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22828656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
