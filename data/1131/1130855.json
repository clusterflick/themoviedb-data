While Anton faces the most visceral horrors of war on a daily basis during his team's urgent, desperate attempts to rescue the most vulnerable, who are often reluctant or unwilling to leave, Zinaida and Taisia seek to pursue any forms of resistance within their power - from praying and writing poetry to hiding historic plaque and reporting intelligence to the Ukrainian military.","popularity":0.1627,"poster_path":"/hVRnbqNvfujwLJpkANYPoGarrps.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117001,"logo_path":"/tLhSGNNKX4VwCNbvPMissO3ea5j.png","name":"Babylon'13","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Poem for Little People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Маленькі люди","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2743143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Sautkin","original_name":"Ivan Sautkin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/dw4Twd1RD6sjLOG5hH2TejjU0HN.jpg","credit_id":"652146d9c1ffbd00e131b190","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2743143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Sautkin","original_name":"Ivan Sautkin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/dw4Twd1RD6sjLOG5hH2TejjU0HN.jpg","credit_id":"652146e2c1ffbd00c48be3d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2743143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Sautkin","original_name":"Ivan Sautkin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/dw4Twd1RD6sjLOG5hH2TejjU0HN.jpg","credit_id":"646db69151e6ab0100846ea9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048230,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olena Saulych","original_name":"Olena Saulych","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lWGjYe2RYi9OI7MxbHwF8Hrpw1J.jpg","credit_id":"646db722a5046e01058d6a0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29429585","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8vx7Rhorh42nkXwBe7P33pfSs6P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9TJP5XeV6feW9I8XJVYy3cNuXCc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3gN3HEfkZGHec8CvAz2bcydMXqy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dOauKKsafEuaCgmco02rZHLdUAa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hVRnbqNvfujwLJpkANYPoGarrps.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/igzd6j54ynSQbhCl5L8WgdRILj5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH:DOX","release_date":"2024-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Ukrainian Edition","release_date":"2024-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Poem for Little People\" Teaser","key":"822168424","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-28T20:59:40.000Z","id":"652147230cb33516f742b0e8"}]}}}
