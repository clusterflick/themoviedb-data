Luc Ferrari seized this opportunity to create a collective structure in 1982: La Muse en Circuit.  Other Ways of Listening retraces the tumultuous history of this association dedicated to the development of non-standard music, drawing on archives and explosive testimonies. The documentary takes the viewer behind the scenes of the experiments, recordings and shows promoted by this institution.  Forty years after its creation, this laboratory continues to irrigate a whole current of unclassifiable music, the common thread of which is still based on sound creation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/k0OKP8GZEwHHVWZ0BKdzR5HzByR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116798,"logo_path":null,"name":"kanari Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Other Ways of Listening","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Other Ways of Listening","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Başka Dinleme Biçimleri","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4078472,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Florenville","original_name":"Jérôme Florenville","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646e23e651e6ab013ab9f1d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3104443,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christophe Neuville","original_name":"Christophe Neuville","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67979512a6e41283f12b3e0e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3104446,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karine Germain","original_name":"Karine Germain","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67979527c7b01b72c72410c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurent Segal","original_name":"Laurent Segal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797953aa6e41283f12b3e5f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k0OKP8GZEwHHVWZ0BKdzR5HzByR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"Engelsiz Filmler Festivali 2024","release_date":"2024-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
