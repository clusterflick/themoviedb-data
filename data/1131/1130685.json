The world is changing fast and humankind is being confronted with rapid climate change, a probable oil crash and an ever-growing population. This documentary closely examines the different ways in which governments and individuals can face these problems: they can deal with them through war or peace. There is a genuine wave occurring in all corners of the world right now, showing us that peace is not a utopia, but rather at arm's length.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hp4JGKQOBcn5xqUoLyCngBgBRwp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soldiers of Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hp4JGKQOBcn5xqUoLyCngBgBRwp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1058}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
