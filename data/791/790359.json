In his classroom in Yokohama, KenKen was born. Enter a world where puzzles matter. From Tokyo to New York, from the classroom to the puzzle page to the tournament floor, Miyamoto and the Machine takes you into the brain of the inventor and the players, all while the machines of business and technology crash into artistry and humanity. Miyamoto believes each handcrafted puzzle tells a story, and if you look hard enough between the rows, columns, and cages of KenKen, you can find the story of the sensei who started a global phenomenon.","popularity":0.4302,"poster_path":"/kQPWeVFVqNsMGdvb7EsXLnbvk8i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148129,"logo_path":null,"name":"PorchProductions Boston","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miyamoto and the Machine: The Story of KenKen","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2952921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetsuya Miyamoto","original_name":"Tetsuya Miyamoto","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60100e6d0e597b00413432dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Shortz","original_name":"Will Shortz","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/rcr8qmVVfb0qbIXikHd6KTOMFzf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60100e8d8ee49c003e648a64","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Sullivan","original_name":"Daniel Sullivan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60100eda22e480003f073af5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Sullivan","original_name":"Daniel Sullivan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60100eeaea84c7003db97a94","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Sullivan","original_name":"Daniel Sullivan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60100efc4d0e8d003d7661b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952923,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louis Cancel","original_name":"Louis Cancel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60100f19dd83fa003e94d03d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952924,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Flaherty","original_name":"Chris Flaherty","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60100f2cd55c3d003e77141d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952924,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Flaherty","original_name":"Chris Flaherty","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60100f45d55c3d003e771434","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernesto Hernandez","original_name":"Ernesto Hernandez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60100f6d8ee49c004064c804","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13739542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kQPWeVFVqNsMGdvb7EsXLnbvk8i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6009,"name":"mathematics"},{"id":2303,"name":"mathematician"},{"id":9228,"name":"puzzle"},{"id":10508,"name":"teacher"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
