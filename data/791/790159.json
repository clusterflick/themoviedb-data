It is also a wake up call to all Americans, whether they ride bicycles or simply value the freedom of speech and peaceably assemble. On Friday August 27, 2004 just days before the start of the Republican National Convention, a massive police operation was underway. By the end of the night 264 people were arrested. It marked one of the largest mass arrests in New York City's history. But that was just the beginning! Still We Ride illustrates the climate of both fear and resilience that gripped NYC's cycling community amidst the ongoing monthly crackdowns.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3yeCehKCxxrPI6FPYj89xoyAs9F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still We Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Lynn","original_name":"Andrew Lynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f37e3cb8028003f06be0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Press","original_name":"Elizabeth Press","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f37f421621b003b97d090","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Ryan","original_name":"Christopher Ryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f38cf9af1710041a37dc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0784837","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yeCehKCxxrPI6FPYj89xoyAs9F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
