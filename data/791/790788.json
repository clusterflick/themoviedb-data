Itâ€™s years like this when you figure out what your riding partners are made of. Despite the lack of snow across most of western North America, the Boondockers crew managed to pull off one of our most memorable seasons to date. We hit the road in exploration of new riding locations off the beaten path and we sniffed out every potential storm like a bloodhound on a fresh scent, leaving no powder caches or technical lines untracked. The result were some of the most incredible terrain and footage ever captured in a sled film. Join us for the highs and lows of a challenging season with plenty of deep powder, big drops and jumps, and the endless pristine backcountry riding that you have come to expect from the Boondockers crew. Intended for audiences of all ages.","popularity":0.2605,"poster_path":"/wYc2xGaALkrUXUGeuaHWvgvFVPJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boondockers 12","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Gardiner","original_name":"Dan Gardiner","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6011980bfd4a96003e322a67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Onasch","original_name":"Adam Onasch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60119816ea84c7003ebc56b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Case","original_name":"Cody Case","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6011981d511d090045da53de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Oberti","original_name":"Anthony Oberti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"601198260e597b0040378ee8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kris Kaltenbacher","original_name":"Kris Kaltenbacher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"601198357f1d83003e6e89e4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Entz","original_name":"Matt Entz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6011983d511d090045da5401","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse O'Rourke","original_name":"Jesse O'Rourke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6011984ab5bc21003e9751b9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Case","original_name":"Aaron Case","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60119852d9f4a600403a2148","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoff Dyer","original_name":"Geoff Dyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6011985ca6ddcb003eb1ff2e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Onasch","original_name":"Kim Onasch","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"601198650e597b0040379019","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Reedy","original_name":"Nick Reedy","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6011986dcb80280040053e41","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Barker","original_name":"Rick Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"601198740816c7003f7f6a2f","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane Kynaston","original_name":"Shane Kynaston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6011987d0e597b0040379065","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Nelson","original_name":"Ryan Nelson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"60119886511d09003eda5b81","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zak Collings","original_name":"Zak Collings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"60119891a35c8e0041618ba4","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Searle","original_name":"Ryan Searle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"6011989ad9f4a600413ac3d8","order":15}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2231,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYc2xGaALkrUXUGeuaHWvgvFVPJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207771,"name":"snowmobile"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
