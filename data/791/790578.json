No amount of violence, painkillers or self loathing can wash away that kind of hell. But try telling that to Taylor Braithwate. The only person he hates more than himself is the terrorist who murdered his daughter and he'll tear the world off its hinges to get the bastard. But first, Taylor must battle through his own ignorance and guilt to accept the help of a Muslim-American cop. Only then does he have a shot at revenge and just maybe a new life.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/t1ijMvLaqsRXJIZ8U7wO1Afnw9Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Override","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1730222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1083,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1ijMvLaqsRXJIZ8U7wO1Afnw9Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":722}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
