Fracture is their earliest work, and isn’t remotely Disney-like, delivering an SF / fantasy scenario of alien inexplicabilities that makes it an animated counterpart of the comic strips that were running in Métal Hurlant (and its US counterpart, Heavy Metal) in the late 1970s.","popularity":0.1483,"poster_path":"/xTpImP6AgkyxNV2cPJEZsAntHXZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arcurace Films","origin_country":""},{"id":98753,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Office de la Création Cinématographique","origin_country":""},{"id":76551,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Académie de France à Rome (Villa Médicis)","origin_country":""},{"id":148158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les films du Triton","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fracture","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaëtan Brizzi","original_name":"Gaëtan Brizzi","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/snuKNubhs26GXPFW3UZLEZbXJiO.jpg","credit_id":"6010968cea84c7003bb9d5ce","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaëtan Brizzi","original_name":"Gaëtan Brizzi","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/snuKNubhs26GXPFW3UZLEZbXJiO.jpg","credit_id":"6010962722e48000400728af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658273,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Stefano Ceccarelli","original_name":"Stefano Ceccarelli","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6010961422e48000410609b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Brizzi","original_name":"Paul Brizzi","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/nDJ010DFAhMpcdau6lgNWYHW8AF.jpg","credit_id":"60109651a6ddcb003eb05f00","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Brizzi","original_name":"Paul Brizzi","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/nDJ010DFAhMpcdau6lgNWYHW8AF.jpg","credit_id":"6010967a0e597b003f35568b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Brizzi","original_name":"Paul Brizzi","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/nDJ010DFAhMpcdau6lgNWYHW8AF.jpg","credit_id":"601096390816c700407e74fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaëtan Brizzi","original_name":"Gaëtan Brizzi","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/snuKNubhs26GXPFW3UZLEZbXJiO.jpg","credit_id":"60109665b5bc21003e9587db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0297124","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ehaRFJZQ4JLRulppxj7W7cWt3J1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xTpImP6AgkyxNV2cPJEZsAntHXZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mEt9OOpbYfj4iFLwAWxhGBXOxme.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
