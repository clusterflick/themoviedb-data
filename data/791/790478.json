But there was only one place where an anti-Latvian campaign was waged, where every Latvian was treated as a spy, a traitor, and the enemy, and therefore deserved to be tortured and shot. This was during the 1937 repression in Russia, where the horror and pathologies, made Latvians into betrayers and murderers of their own kind.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":"/lKQ61VjVZ9ouahqTrK8on2t2rjQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibīrijas bērni","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2011-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Train Station Latvians 1937","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60106a42ea84c7003cb959a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60107843a6ddcb003fb016ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399778,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ēriks Lanss","original_name":"Ēriks Lanss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60107856ea84c7003dba265f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aivars Lubānietis","original_name":"Aivars Lubānietis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6010786aa35c8e003f5fa821","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398274,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normunds Deinats","original_name":"Normunds Deinats","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60107881d9f4a600403887ec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601078979a6435003e93d013","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKQ61VjVZ9ouahqTrK8on2t2rjQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stacija Latviesi 1937 (trailer)","key":"HywUZutQhKE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-04-03T17:33:43.000Z","id":"6010720546f3540041b55864"}]}}}
