As he sits, he calls friends, family and ex-lovers, excusing himself from all their celebrations. Luna tells us, \"In the work there is a thin line between what is fictional and what is non-fiction, and what is real emotion and what is art. … There is a cultural element where I let (or seem to let) people in on American Indian cultures. There are also elements in the work about American culture that everyone can identify with, and that makes for an understanding that we are all more alike than different.\"","popularity":0.0874,"poster_path":"/gCg8wvNJoFnbrtEoDzWUkjoqd6S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The History of the Luiseño People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The History of the Luiseño People: La Jolla Reservation, Christmas 1990","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"La Jolla Reservation, Christmas 1990","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2953016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Luna","original_name":"James Luna","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"622d3a5122931a0079afe422","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Artenstein","original_name":"Isaac Artenstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d3a76e210230078e18fd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2953016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Luna","original_name":"James Luna","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d3a6e89b561001b5c2c54","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Artenstein","original_name":"Isaac Artenstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d3a66f90b19007b1dec6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463274,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles Landon","original_name":"Charles Landon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d3a82501cf2001db6598e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gCg8wvNJoFnbrtEoDzWUkjoqd6S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco Cinematheque","release_date":"2021-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
