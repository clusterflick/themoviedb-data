He denies that he suffers from mental illness and openly boasts of his cleverness and cunning behavior. He kills the man though he loves him, holds no grudges against him and murders without any motive. The movie works heavily with green screen and computer coloration to achieve interesting special effects with the real life actors and the environment.","popularity":0.1772,"poster_path":"/oFr9C9V2KODLBOayRPc3fCxto4N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tell-Tale Heart","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Montoya","original_name":"Sebastian Montoya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Servant","credit_id":"600ea37a4d0e8d003f792ca6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Bain","original_name":"Glenn Bain","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Officer","credit_id":"600ea38b813cb60040806366","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Salamone","original_name":"John Salamone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Officer","credit_id":"600ea399813cb60041811987","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.J.
