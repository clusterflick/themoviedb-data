For example the initial conflict between innocence and social convention, as seen in the confusion of a child. I have tried to project the subconscious conflict-contradiction-of life and inevitable death. Thus the film is in two movements as it were. In the first, a figure dressed in white to symbolise life, moves through and explores a series of structures and objects. In the second movement the figure is replaced by a figure in black, who wanders back through the wreckage of the structures. As death, she controls life until they write into nothingness.\"  - Elaine Shemilt","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/hsHfNEx6i0NpJU8l148WhSuy1fR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conflict","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2468401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elaine Shemilt","original_name":"Elaine Shemilt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/jnksndQ8hdHRa0W1S4t5suwLcKk.jpg","credit_id":"60102fe10e597b0041345e88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hsHfNEx6i0NpJU8l148WhSuy1fR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"The Video Show, Serpentine Gallery","release_date":"1975-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
