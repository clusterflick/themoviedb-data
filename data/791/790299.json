The police investigate this, but are baffled, and unable to solve this mystery. The woman is Seth Durgadas' late wife. The police interview Seth Durgadas but nothing comes of it. In the meantime, Ranjeet (N.A. Ansari) rescues Sabita (Shakila), the only daughter of Seth Durgadas from the clutches of a tiger, and himself is disfigured for life. Out of pity, Durgadas appoints him manager of his organization and wealth, and soon a greedy Ranjeet starts showing his true colors, which ultimately result in the murder of Durgadas, and the prime suspect is none other than Suresh Kumar (Ajit), the man who Sabita loves.","popularity":0.212,"poster_path":"/ewfMxLK9leOI14Hg5M0bpDCfknm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deesh Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tower House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ajit Khan","original_name":"Ajit Khan","popularity":0.2756,"profile_path":"/n1jzEpNe1zW2h9wwhgjg3N731YH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"600fcaa7813cb60040822624","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":562286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shakila","original_name":"Shakila","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/l6B4sR7X8tHKaxxi1HkSdCe9hdf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"600fcaacdd83fa003f975bb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nisar Ahmad Ansari","original_name":"Nisar Ahmad Ansari","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"600fcacc0e597b0040347ae5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nisar Ahmad Ansari","original_name":"Nisar Ahmad Ansari","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600fcae2c8113d003e93c3ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0155286","wikidata_id":"Q10951605","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1619,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ewfMxLK9leOI14Hg5M0bpDCfknm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1079}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
