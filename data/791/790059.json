This new perspective entails a number of bold creative choices that do not make use of the traditional staging imagery associated with Aida. Aida’s command to Radames — “Ritorna vincitor!” — comes at a price. The triumphal march of the victorious Egyptians is a procession for the coffins of the heroes fallen in battle, the chorus are their grieving kinsfolk. McDermott’s staging resonates keenly with the images of so many civilian and military funerals that crowd our newsfeeds. Here is a triumphal march that does not seek to hide the true, lethal and disastrous nature of war, whatever side you are on.","popularity":0.091,"poster_path":"/g3mz6Khhft1t3f7rFZbCRrmSD0D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grand Théâtre de Genève","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aida: Grand Théâtre de Genève","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazhmiddin Mavlyanov","original_name":"Nazhmiddin Mavlyanov","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"600ec9ef22e480004004b937","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serena Farnocchia","original_name":"Serena Farnocchia","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"600ec9f7ed28b9003ffb8e56","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Smirnova","original_name":"Anna Smirnova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"600eca00c8113d003e924ce0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1724542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Markov","original_name":"Alexey Markov","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/vxLsapYCjh0yE5YvlTvVluJ1xW7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"600eca07d55c3d004073eab2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Thomson","original_name":"Donald Thomson","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"600eca1fcb8028004001cf76","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denzil Delaere","original_name":"Denzil Delaere","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"600eca250e597b004032b938","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire de Sévigné","original_name":"Claire de Sévigné","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"600eca2cc433ea003e440c68","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonio Ghislanzoni","original_name":"Antonio Ghislanzoni","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/wVj1HgypsglP6ahPoW03BAhmTRd.jpg","credit_id":"600ecace9a6435003d926ee6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"600ecaa14d0e8d003c76ce93","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phelim McDermott","original_name":"Phelim McDermott","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9jxA0ZUS0HvaTKkrNrSpU3UxITE.jpg","credit_id":"600ec9e6d70594003d258fa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g3mz6Khhft1t3f7rFZbCRrmSD0D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
