In his staging of the version he abridged with Joana Mallwitz for the Salzburg Festival 2020 the focus is wholly on the figures and the subtle choreography of their emotional states — in a space that like a magnifying glass exposes the intricate mechanisms between the characters. In this way the production leads the protagonists and the audience to experience the ‘serene calm’ that can perhaps indeed cure our own ‘distempers’.","popularity":0.1519,"poster_path":"/oRZBirF6YDOdpPOaMnEvnjviRwD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salzburger
