Film producer Andris Slapiņš was killed, and cameraman Gvido Zvaigzne was fatally injured on the night of January 20th and died in hospital two weeks later. He was a young man whose talent had not yet fully flourished. His story, however, contains elements that make it not only possible to demonstrate his personal tragedy, but also the problematic existence of a young and creative person during an era when everything was crumbling around him. Destiny kept Gvido Zvaigzne from finishing his route, but the events and values of his life represent a model of his generation’s efforts.","popularity":0.2324,"poster_path":"/syNehVOmPMXZ4CWefz5QGHmq2um.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibīrijas bērni","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2011-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gvido Zvaigzne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398274,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normunds Deinats","original_name":"Normunds Deinats","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60107f5b7f1d8300406cd1d7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60107ef6a6ddcb003eb03436","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aivars Lubānietis","original_name":"Aivars Lubānietis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60107f3446f354003fb4e895","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60107eeaa6ddcb0040b0461b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60107f6c4d0e8d003d76f27a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871726,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Agris Redovičs","original_name":"Agris Redovičs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60107f1fcb8028004107650f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arvo Pärt","original_name":"Arvo Pärt","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/bq7OliFL8gf9ERIck9jhPivfv7z.jpg","credit_id":"60107f48b5bc21003d93b67c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/syNehVOmPMXZ4CWefz5QGHmq2um.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
