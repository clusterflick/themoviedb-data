Ding Dong insists on telling him the ‘real’ history of Ireland over a number of pints. From the Normans to the Famine to 1916 and the sex shops of O’Connell Street, we hear Ding Dong Denny’s delusional take on events that shaped this nation. Ding Dong is a comic creation of comedian Paul Woodful, and is his first adventure into animation.","popularity":0.1391,"poster_path":"/fjrFGsd3IG9PJvRqZ4lCb75BgqU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ding Dong Denny’s History of Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257428,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cathal Gaffney","original_name":"Cathal Gaffney","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61302d817f6c8d0043f321ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952070,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"James Stacey","original_name":"James Stacey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f248d22e480003e06e524","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466436,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gary Blatchford","original_name":"Gary Blatchford","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f24a4c8113d00409289cc","department":"Writing","job":"Storyboard"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952071,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jean Herliliy","original_name":"Jean Herliliy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f24d0ea84c7003eb803f7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952072,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mark Tsang","original_name":"Mark Tsang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f24fd1bf87600411b92de","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952073,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Seamus O'Toole","original_name":"Seamus O'Toole","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f253c2a210c0042a2c2f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596958,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darren Hendley","original_name":"Darren Hendley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f2555d55c3d003f72f652","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032364,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Brian Gilmore","original_name":"Brian Gilmore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f259892e55b003e675ca6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952074,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Woodfull","original_name":"Paul Woodfull","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f25ab92e55b004067cf1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fjrFGsd3IG9PJvRqZ4lCb75BgqU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
