In front of a pitch black backdrop, the ring appears, disappears and reappears, at times suddenly, at other times gradually. What changes is its scale and the angle it is seen in. Testing out the frontiers of perception, the flatness of the circular shape gives way to a three-dimensional object.  The minimal, yet grand imagery unfolds to a musical soundtrack of intensely high notes and an extreme bass. Otherworldly and intangible, One takes the viewer on a journey that amalgamates earthly and cosmic spheres, the real and the imaginary.  The project has been realised with the support of the Film Center Serbia and the Academic Film Center SCCC Serbia.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/nOkXOCQ15OoafR44K7Tk2VEf5Us.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4519266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadine Poulain","original_name":"Nadine Poulain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e61824be7f35017cb352b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4519266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadine Poulain","original_name":"Nadine Poulain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e61887a672540162aab7b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289589,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Milan Milosavljević","original_name":"Milan Milosavljević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e6186120e6a5016352febf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4519266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadine Poulain","original_name":"Nadine Poulain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e6187ca672540149a8d014","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOkXOCQ15OoafR44K7Tk2VEf5Us.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
