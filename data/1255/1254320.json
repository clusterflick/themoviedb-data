Nila is the result of a temporary marriage, which allows a man to marry a woman even if he is already married. Children born from such a relationship are legally non-existent. As long as the father does not recognize the child, no birth certificate can be issued and Nila cannot attend school. The documentary depicts Leyla's tireless efforts to clarify Nila's legal status in order to offer her a perspective for her future. In a never-ending bureaucratic battle, Leyla fights not only against the legal system, but also against a judgmental society.","popularity":0.4312,"poster_path":"/i7Urupxvpjw3UT6as9O5vM8hkpY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199130,"logo_path":"/aiJH8dGWb5S76V4iCI1RlokzOr1.png","name":"Windcatcher Productions","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nila's Dream in the Garden of Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nila Rahmati","original_name":"Nila Rahmati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661fcda87aecc601636c1084","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leyla Biouk","original_name":"Leyla Biouk","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661fcda27aecc6017c6d1026","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Radzuweit","original_name":"Mia Radzuweit","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nila (voice)","credit_id":"661fcd5d3c434401630359b6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmin Tabatabai","original_name":"Jasmin Tabatabai","popularity":0.2564,"profile_path":"/dndUImgq5o664IzodTpK9lngzQY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leyla (voice)","credit_id":"661fcd521cfe3a017d9c5c79","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4572847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niloufar Taghizadeh","original_name":"Niloufar Taghizadeh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e634d1a672540185ae34cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4572847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niloufar Taghizadeh","original_name":"Niloufar Taghizadeh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e63547006b010186a3beb4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4572847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niloufar Taghizadeh","original_name":"Niloufar Taghizadeh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fcdb81cfe3a014a9aec44","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2052312,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martin Pieper","original_name":"Martin Pieper","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fcdbfb84cdd017d654af0","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54004,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marlene Assmann","original_name":"Marlene Assmann","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fcd80c09e99017db0ba4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Majid Derakhshâni","original_name":"Majid Derakhshâni","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fcd8d7aecc6017c6d1011","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2073316,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katharina Krohmann","original_name":"Katharina Krohmann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fcdc96a300b017e3377be","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658028,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Petra Bereuter","original_name":"Petra Bereuter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fcd7c6d9fe8017d615fd2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9dfy0iUjEY5lsIibmfkURImEaDk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1404,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2xlPyfxEiVGr3uXoDyDODrNimqb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":936},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1133,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i7Urupxvpjw3UT6as9O5vM8hkpY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":755}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18009,"name":"iran"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeden svět 2024","release_date":"2024-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
