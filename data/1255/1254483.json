Visiting scenic locations shot by King Hu, the short experiments with the road movie genre and its intersection with the martial arts epic. Sia meets actor Shih Chun, who played the protagonist in Hu’s Dragon Inn, Touch of Zen and other wuxia films, as he guides the quest to re-encounter the iconic landscapes where Dragon Inn was shot. He advises on the perfect conditions of mist and weather. Yet, in the journey through the mountains of Hehuanshan, the sublime landscape of King Hu remains ever elusive. She later visits the elementary school of Indigenous filmmaker and principal Pilin Yapu of the Atayal tribe. Absent of conventional subtitles, the essay film employs text burned into the center of the frame as a mode of translation, sometimes refusing total disclosure. – tiffanysia.com/glossary/the-sojourn","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":"/qmsAgKg91TcW02PqyEc0PoNRYqi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sojourn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"暫棲","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shih Chun","original_name":"石雋","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":"/vc163tIreoqREnmHn1I2VbImWsm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e69a00cede6900c9bd8eb9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiffany Sia","original_name":"Tiffany Sia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e698a2ef8b320185d72f66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7rVLq7A46uvmV9E6QLNbXjv0Jno.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3584}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qmsAgKg91TcW02PqyEc0PoNRYqi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World premiere at Museum of Modern Art, part of \"Cinema After Place: Tiffany Sia and Pavle Levi in Conversation\" of  Doc Fortnight 2024: MoMA’s Festival of International Nonfiction Film and Media. https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/9409","release_date":"2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
