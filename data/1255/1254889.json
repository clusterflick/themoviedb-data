This outlines the typical client profile of family genetic counseling centers, which provide information about the risks of having a child with a neural tube defect, for example. A team of specialists from Leipzig, including a woman, is introduced who invites parents of newborn disabled children to have the disability clarified by family genetics. The diagnostic testing of a disabled infant will be shown. Middle-aged couples who wish to have children are also shown.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7M1dmZrROem8wSds9oUD0XNQvPW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":220921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsches Hygiene-Museum","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genetische Familienberatung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Hildebrandt","original_name":"Hans Hildebrandt","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65e7a03842f19f01318c4ce0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Günter Lippmann","original_name":"Günter Lippmann","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/jqvXixh0I2XuIAedctsvOlNuM0C.jpg","credit_id":"65e79fcecaab6d018595040a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4296759,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hartmut Haase","original_name":"Hartmut Haase","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e7a024a6c1040164e81d0c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575013,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Heinz Borrmann","original_name":"Heinz Borrmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e79ff451f99a0162fbc128","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Günter Lippmann","original_name":"Günter Lippmann","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/jqvXixh0I2XuIAedctsvOlNuM0C.jpg","credit_id":"65e79fd6a1a9ba0185bdc65d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4572992,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Heide Zenthöfer","original_name":"Heide Zenthöfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e79ffeeb093201871b019a","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001989,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lilo Weiße","original_name":"Lilo Weiße","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e7a00cea4263017b211b4a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7M1dmZrROem8wSds9oUD0XNQvPW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
