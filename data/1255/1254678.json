In its first half, Ron Vawter, following a script by Gary Indiana, conjures an after-dinner speech as it might have been delivered by notorious right wing political figure and closeted gay man Roy Cohn, as he addresses “The American Association for the Protection of the Family”. In its second half, Vawter re-emerges on stage in flamboyant costume as fiercely queer performance art pioneer, Jack Smith. Together, the two portraits present a complex, incisive, and discomforting view of queer identities as they collide with American culture. – Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.1421,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roy Cohn/Jack Smith (Live Stage Recording)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Vawter","original_name":"Ron Vawter","popularity":0.2724,"profile_path":"/f5WDxaiBGOP5bg3JsZEpotnJYbE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Roy Cohn & Jack Smith","credit_id":"65e72e7509dda4017cbeb6ba","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
