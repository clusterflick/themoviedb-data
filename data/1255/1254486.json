The film summarizes the facts at hand, including some pre-NAFTA speculation about economic dependency on the United States. At roughly thirty percent, the Canada of a few decades ago was more foreign-owned than any other country in the world. Still, however, a great and stubborn national pride in our cultural and social idiosyncrasies persists, resulting in the confidence to look elsewhere besides the United States for economic alliances and models. This episode is the fifth and last part of the series Reckoning: The Political Economy of Canada.","popularity":0.3715,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Crossroads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Laxer","original_name":"James Laxer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lpYhjUJNabKTsAeRLNlVLp1CilI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"65e69a8d5f6c49018646c983","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moira Simpson","original_name":"Moira Simpson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e69af00d11f201866cb0d7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moira Simpson","original_name":"Moira Simpson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e69a9c097c4901866600fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Laxer","original_name":"James Laxer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lpYhjUJNabKTsAeRLNlVLp1CilI.jpg","credit_id":"65e69afa5f6c49018646cae1","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389419,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Johnson","original_name":"George Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e69adf0d11f201866cb0b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Taylor","original_name":"John Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6731ded56895f3822e45f886","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939465,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruce Giesbrecht","original_name":"Bruce Giesbrecht","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677069c677e2b6d478926d04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moira Simpson","original_name":"Moira Simpson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677069d3b70013cc0f612fa9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31906,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Geddes","original_name":"David Geddes","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67706a635f1c4fa473613955","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186459,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce Ruddell","original_name":"Bruce Ruddell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67706b0d43a21982da127aa4","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271805,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Debra Rurak","original_name":"Debra Rurak","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67706b3e3dff0de99b61aa01","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0224627","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14737,"name":"economics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
