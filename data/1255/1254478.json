No longer competitive in the world market, and forced to buy more than it could sell, the US nevertheless continued to bask in the glow of past glory rather than face its immediate predicament. Meanwhile, Japan and other Pacific Rim countries were gaining economic ground, perhaps permanently.  This film was part one of the series, Reckoning: The Political Economy of Canada.","popularity":0.4338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":222574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Psychomedia Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise and Fall of American Business Culture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Laxer","original_name":"James Laxer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lpYhjUJNabKTsAeRLNlVLp1CilI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"65e693e81db65d014992db9a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalle Lasn","original_name":"Kalle Lasn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gJDd8ZNyqcHnZK3L85OFZb4aVcx.jpg","credit_id":"65e696f66332f7017c914d75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalle Lasn","original_name":"Kalle Lasn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gJDd8ZNyqcHnZK3L85OFZb4aVcx.jpg","credit_id":"65e69721cede690185bdda5e","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalle Lasn","original_name":"Kalle Lasn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gJDd8ZNyqcHnZK3L85OFZb4aVcx.jpg","credit_id":"65e697380d11f201636c8a7e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Taylor","original_name":"John Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6731dfc44cee4fc8d5d188e4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barry P.
