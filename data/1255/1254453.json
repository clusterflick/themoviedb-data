He was cunning and greedy. And everything was not enough for him, he also hoped for someone else's good. He deceived everyone – both neighbors and people he met who did good to him: He stole supplies from a neighbor, and a golden tail from a Fish Mother. He also wanted to deceive the bear who warmed him-fed him. Yes, only all the offended ones gathered and outwitted the Fox themselves so much that he became a laughing stock, and received hot ones from his wife.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio \"Pilot\"","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventures of a Fox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2966167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Kuznetsov","original_name":"Andrey Kuznetsov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wPTXeouxR7h1eS63rVoWGkzDtdU.jpg","credit_id":"65e683a81db65d018792e2f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
