What about your thinking needs to change? How does your whole family come together to nurture and support them? The frank, vulnerable interviews with families living through this potentially scary transition demonstrate how loving and accepting your gender nonconforming child in the face of ignorance and outright hostility from the community have made them more compassionate human beings. At its heart, it’s about how acceptance and unconditional love allow these kids to be who they are and not just survive, but thrive.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/5aG2l1CXxNJ5lnodAxhhWabkLy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Family Journey: Raising Gender Nonconforming Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1853054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Skurnik","original_name":"Jonathan Skurnik","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e7ae4242f19f01878c773b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5aG2l1CXxNJ5lnodAxhhWabkLy1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
