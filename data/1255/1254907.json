G. Chesler’s new documentary feature presents eight portraits of trans, postgender, and genderqueer people sharing their experiences of cultivating, sustaining, and joining communities in this pandemic. These trans community creators center experiences of Asian American people facing violent racism as the pandemic began in late 2019, Black Americans rising in opposition to white supremacist police-state violence in mid 2020, and the exclusion many people who are disabled feel from a society that—despite grave and massive loss—still refuses to habitually protect itself at large.","popularity":0.0738,"poster_path":"/38FsHyEVSOKJAKXfk1W1SKfvOvu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61947,"logo_path":null,"name":"G6 Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Witnessing trans lives in COVID-19","title":"Connection | Isolation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5342871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"G.
