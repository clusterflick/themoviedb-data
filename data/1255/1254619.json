Hard work, keeping on the move, creativity, and an insatiable desire for experimentation paint a portrait of the 80-year-old actor who continues to surprise and be surprised, to define and be defined by her own art. An engaging and deeply honest documentary that invites you on a journey of discovery of inspiration, through the beneficial effect of the passage of time.","popularity":0.1462,"poster_path":"/aZNfqItMrTcgyYwb8tYV7MUeBBW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165898,"logo_path":"/vBrwZHCYcp8T23rE3AsQu4ffA3J.png","name":"Pio & Co","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":37159,"logo_path":"/aZxA9srDC56wBl7ppYEAB2ZPSP2.png","name":"Rei Pictures","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marilú – Encounter with a Remarkable Woman","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":582884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilú Marini","original_name":"Marilú Marini","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/7vlHa5CglnVQO1LVphSySCgXO4i.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elle-même","credit_id":"65e70bb9ef8b320185d8033b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandrine Dumas","original_name":"Sandrine Dumas","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":"/2zgcukScZ9jqtdHhdREf9PmPn08.jpg","credit_id":"65e70b94ef8b320185d80324","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":2362,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aZNfqItMrTcgyYwb8tYV7MUeBBW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1742}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BAFICI","release_date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
