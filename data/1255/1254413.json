Mike, Kevin, and Bill will riff Point Break LIVE at the State Theatre in Minneapolis on July 27th, and the resulting hilarity will be broadcast to over 700 movie theaters across America on Thursday, August 8th with an encore on Tuesday, August 13th thanks to our partners at Fathom Events.","popularity":0.9032,"poster_path":"/5LkRJ9RZUhUadjaaucldnya93n2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15004,"logo_path":null,"name":"RiffTrax","origin_country":""},{"id":1644,"logo_path":"/l5JFudbLN3vr1sSkjRoqF7To8Ky.png","name":"Largo Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RiffTrax Live: Point Break","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30020,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael J.
