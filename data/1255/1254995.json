The film is a reflection on the complexity of Palestinian existence and the torturously disturbing \"ordinariness\" of living under constant curfew. The film's title reflects this, as the Arabic words used to describe the imposed curfew \"mane' tajawwul\" literally translate as \"forbidden to wander\". The video is also the journey of personal discovery for the filmmaker, the wanderer who falls in love with a Palestinian man in Gaza.","popularity":0.296,"poster_path":"/8yz8bVCYgkJEbIPZWoQg172CuR0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden to Wander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1078614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Youssef","original_name":"Susan Youssef","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e7d25dc15f89018616262c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575370,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mohammed Hamdan","original_name":"Mohammed Hamdan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e7d282caab6d0185957d1a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10350524","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8yz8bVCYgkJEbIPZWoQg172CuR0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":539,"name":"middle east"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":6683,"name":"autobiography"},{"id":252689,"name":"videography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
