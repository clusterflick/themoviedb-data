The band’s sixth, and best-selling album, features their most well-known track ‘I’d Love To Change The World’, which regularly features in movies and TV shows. The song saw the band taking a more melodic direction from previous releases and showcased the band at their peak. The brand new stereo mix is by original producer/engineer, Chris Kimsey, using transfers from the original two-inch multitrack tapes. Chris' work on the stereo mix was the basis for the new Atmos Mix.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lDbjvDkizK4ZxNsxCwelPBYJ6jK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten Years After / A Space in Time blu-ray audio","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":897,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8pnXVWW4JSbveSomtJLcYJuMow5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1595}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDbjvDkizK4ZxNsxCwelPBYJ6jK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
