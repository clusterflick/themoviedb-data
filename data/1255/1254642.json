Lebsi dates Rave, a young street dancer who makes a living dancing in the streets of central Lisbon, and they have a daughter in common. Prima is an orphan of both her father and mother and learned to let go of herself very early on. She lives alone with a cat and found selling cannabis as her alternative to generating money and paying the bills. Still, she is also a respected beat producer in the neighborhood. Both want to improve their lives, they dream of getting out of the “zone” but in the meantime they are living as best they can, asserting themselves in their way.","popularity":0.145,"poster_path":"/tgfvBwQ0mQ3UFOgwO3KHukllPVE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Somali","iso_639_1":"so","name":"Somali"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prima + Lebsi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3273436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nádia Yracema","original_name":"Nádia Yracema","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/zMSGXPBPa1rnfi60HDie0U9txTw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65e7bc52e3294301869c2f5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3184024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joãozinho da Costa","original_name":"Joãozinho da Costa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65e7bc73e3294301869c2fd8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alesa Herero","original_name":"Alesa Herero","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65e7bc7ca1a9ba0185be0059","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Welket Bungué","original_name":"Welket Bungué","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/91GlmzrJyhaBscr4IqVUrnRueGS.jpg","credit_id":"65e71969e55937017dc83050","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Welket Bungué","original_name":"Welket Bungué","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/91GlmzrJyhaBscr4IqVUrnRueGS.jpg","credit_id":"65e7bc8da6c1040187e876ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16588990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tgfvBwQ0mQ3UFOgwO3KHukllPVE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
