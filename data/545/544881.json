He was energetic, adventurous and charismatic. Alessandro started to document this strange creature with his video camera, so different from himself. They were in their early twenties and living in Rome...every experience together felt new and exciting. But when Casey moved to the Middle East to work as a TV journalist, Alessandro's world was opened up even more. Drawn from 15 years of footage, The Things We Keep is an intimate look at friendship, a celebration of people's common humanity and an invitation to break out of one’s comfort zone.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":"/qohsHvRa6r8hzgADgB18sZEJJ2y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89897,"logo_path":"/v3rlDYOuNvmwXkUV0O1tIIdbadZ.png","name":"YUZU Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Things We Keep","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Was bleibt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","original_name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d56da75f1ad00c235b12b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Casey Kauffman","original_name":"Casey Kauffman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d56e7efe37c007ef0c75b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Casey Kauffman","original_name":"Casey Kauffman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8392cb92514159ce03214e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","original_name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8392bc0e0a264596035e07","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","original_name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8392a2c3a3686558046980","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Casey Kauffman","original_name":"Casey Kauffman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8392b1c3a368655503c559","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155061,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claudio Hughes","original_name":"Claudio Hughes","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5d12a266ae4d001489797d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488728,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kathrin Dietzel","original_name":"Kathrin Dietzel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5d12cc87e63e001773e41e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092952,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Popp","original_name":"Christian Popp","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5d128f66ae4d0014897936","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","original_name":"Alessandro Cassigoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5d12b487e63e001373f2a9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7385120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vEl2zd6PNDpk9gK0FE55ACPGGHy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/NdzvamZXeiBQm98StHbCCrqW0X.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":944},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qohsHvRa6r8hzgADgB18sZEJJ2y.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":706},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fc4xNv4OxRGy8WJqV3EPFMGq07C.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
