Controversial at the time of its release, Antoinette Sabrier finds Dulac using her bold sense of visual rhythm to achieve a complex portrait of a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage and a nuanced investigation into human intimacy, with her characters’ emotions expressed through then-innovative cinematic techniques such as slow motion and associative montage. \"  - Film Society of Lincoln Center","popularity":0.1812,"poster_path":"/rSS2HIJ8k0NE6XIVMZqlz1n85Fa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antoinette Sabrier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1001945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ève Francis","original_name":"Ève Francis","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/reFIqAeKnQ7ju8LqvAayeQFLytp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Antoinette Sabrier","credit_id":"5b8175b892514159e00132db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Gabrio","original_name":"Gabriel Gabrio","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/2H55al1OCSlY5EaaJKISs0Sel2y.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Germain Sabrier","credit_id":"5b8176c30e0a26458f011bd6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Toulout","original_name":"Jean Toulout","popularity":0.1296,"profile_path":"/cpv9nwb18Sg4XHdHl2bVsO8vu4G.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jamagne","credit_id":"5b8176d9c3a36865550139d6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Guidé","original_name":"Paul Guidé","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/y8iPBSpBUt1NjroiCzPOUgMiOqf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5b8585edc3a3686553054d1d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvette Armel","original_name":"Yvette Armel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecde9a321c4ca0020db5222","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":997694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germaine Dulac","original_name":"Germaine Dulac","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/n0rxdRSsnT1CvowdjSq6If1AMal.jpg","credit_id":"5b81751492514159dd012090","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":997694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germaine Dulac","original_name":"Germaine Dulac","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/n0rxdRSsnT1CvowdjSq6If1AMal.jpg","credit_id":"5b81755092514159d901151b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869488,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Romain Coolus","original_name":"Romain Coolus","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b81755cc3a36865530120ac","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343479,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Raoul Aubourdier","original_name":"Raoul Aubourdier","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8175760e0a264589011070","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043393,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Parguel","original_name":"Paul Parguel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b81758492514159d9011553","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29730,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maurice Forster","original_name":"Maurice Forster","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8175900e0a26458c011e5b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017633","wikidata_id":"Q16088636","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rSS2HIJ8k0NE6XIVMZqlz1n85Fa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
