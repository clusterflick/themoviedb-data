Since then, this illustrious empress has fascinated adults and children alike. A century later, we present to you a historical documentary on the exceptional destiny of this legendary empress. Her legendary beauty, her charm and her independence of mind, her thirst for travel and her passion for sports were as magical as they were dramatic, but the memory she left behind for eternity is that of a woman close to all. This film highlights the political role of Empress Elisabeth, neglected by historians, as well as her tastes and passions. The important stages of her life are also widely mentioned, such as her marriage to the young Emperor Franz Joseph, the disappearance of her cousin King Ludwig II of Bavaria and the tragedy of Mayerling.","popularity":0.1701,"poster_path":"/mU9Whearqs6uFs5glQI71kpSdIo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Janus Diffusion","origin_country":""},{"id":180914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alpa Média","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sissi, L'impératrice de la solitude","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Sissi, impératrice de la solitude","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2115428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyrille Boulay","original_name":"Cyrille Boulay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6301b5d4532acb007bd3b0dd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2115428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyrille Boulay","original_name":"Cyrille Boulay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b825b8c0e0a264589020ba7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mU9Whearqs6uFs5glQI71kpSdIo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":191341,"name":"franz joseph i"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"DVD release","release_date":"2007-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sissi, Impératrice de la solitude - Documentaire histoire","key":"uFIBhWZNkzA","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-27T14:17:40.000Z","id":"6301b634c2f44b009184cc0f"}]}}}
