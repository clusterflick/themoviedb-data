In February, 2009, about 400,000 people gathered in Myung Dong for a brief meeting for a single reason. The late cardinal KIM Sou-hwan became the first cardinal in a land of poor faith. He summoned up his courage when no one took action. He practiced love as a miracle until he left us. He was a respected senior of the society beyond the religion in the turbulent times; a figure whose life had been like a fence for the disadvantaged. The late cardinal KIM Sou-hwan was ‘a great man of the era’. His passionate love is now revived on the screen.","popularity":0.2634,"poster_path":"/tBgkzuwZg2rdKuR8477qj1FNq4g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This love changes our life","title":"Baboya","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahn Sung-ki","original_name":"안성기","popularity":0.4157,"profile_path":"/neVI6dF7ygagu055h5OpHUZax14.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5b840b86c3a368655103b571","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2205242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Sou-hwan","original_name":"Kim Sou-hwan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c6bd6ef29d66004e40a5bc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kang Sung-ok","original_name":"Kang Sung-ok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b840baa92514159e4043411","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1289,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/tSNclOm4zkQafhn8yuV0lAm8AbU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tBgkzuwZg2rdKuR8477qj1FNq4g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":172391,"name":"catholic priest"},{"id":204357,"name":"cardinal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
