Theirs is a life of shared dedication for the water and to waves that rarely come. In the backdrop is a Great Lakes city trying to recover from a legacy of lost industry, lost jobs and a river polluted enough to catch on fire. Still this culture persists in this unlikely corner of the surfing universe amid harsh weather and gray skies. For them, the golden age of surfing is right now. And it's happening on the frozen beaches of Lake Erie, five hundred miles from the nearest ocean.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/6hKXuRTh2IyiQ8Wdy7QVQozPQAT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary that explores the underground community of surfers in Cleveland, Ohio","title":"Out Of Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1526619","wikidata_id":"Q7111600","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":860,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6hKXuRTh2IyiQ8Wdy7QVQozPQAT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
