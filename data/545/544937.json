Фрагменты","overview":"This film was shot during the last year of Daniil Dondurey’s life in Moscow and Tel Aviv, where he was receiving treatment. Dondurey’s monologue is broken up by city landscapes, the animated buzz of a café, the silence of an emptied dacha… Dondurey talks about his pursuits, encounters, and tastes; he recalls his student years in Leningrad. He jokes, smiles, and hopes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daniil Dondurey: Fragments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2044434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Dondurey","original_name":"Tamara Dondurey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eGO9s6M5jkUN5WhRNBmVoWvPowx.jpg","credit_id":"5b8400b492514159dd041761","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
