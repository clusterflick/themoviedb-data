The installation features two monumental birds fabricated entirely from materials harvested from construction sites in urban China, including demolition debris, steel beams, tools, and remnants of the daily lives of migrant laborers. At once fierce and strangely beautiful, the mythic Phoenixes bear witness to the complex interconnection between labor, history, commercial development, and the rapid accumulation of wealth in today's China. The film Xu Bing: Phoenix documents the process of creating the work through to its installation at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASSMoCA).","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/cHHXJ3Pc8nQ1zV7UCqIDpdwcH37.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Xu Bing: Phoenix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"徐冰：凤凰","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2118125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xu Bing","original_name":"Xu Bing","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gIBqln2TNpb6nKbIkfZTM8tPj9c.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b87a1160e0a266f2600a858","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Traub","original_name":"Daniel Traub","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m87DsUamv6KYuFZKPsdt8twwwKA.jpg","credit_id":"5b87a0460e0a266f20009eee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Traub","original_name":"Daniel Traub","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m87DsUamv6KYuFZKPsdt8twwwKA.jpg","credit_id":"5b87a04ec3a3681ff200972f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3045510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cHHXJ3Pc8nQ1zV7UCqIDpdwcH37.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
