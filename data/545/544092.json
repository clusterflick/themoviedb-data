The starting point for the research is the class photo that gives the film its title. The conversations with the men, which revolve around their lives, bring back memories. However, it becomes clear how many of them have repressed the events of the Nazi era. Apologies, excuses and trivialization of the violence and crimes come out of many mouths.","popularity":0.0762,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":187,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klassenphoto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Klassenfoto","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Klassenphoto -
