In so doing, the program cuts through much of the mythos surrounding the conflict itself and enables us to see the war in a fresh new way. It draws on elements including personal correspondence, diaries, archival photographs and much more. Installments include: \"Rally Round the Flag,\" \"Rebels at the Gates,\" \"High Water Mark,\" \"General Grant's War,\" and \"Jubilation.\"","popularity":0.4116,"poster_path":"/tI5Bk4ibKOL6JYFN6BZfWjjKQkx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Image/Madacy Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":293,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American Civil War","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Civil War: A Living History","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Brown","original_name":"Allan Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5b80a210c3a36865510029cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Corey Beatty, Sr.","original_name":"Adam Corey Beatty, Sr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b80a22a0e0a2645890026df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Pay","original_name":"Don Pay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5b80a2310e0a26458600286c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Stone Vincey","original_name":"Sandra Stone Vincey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5b80a23f0e0a264596002630","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114541,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Feuerherd","original_name":"Edward Feuerherd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a01ac3a368655b00268e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114542,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Filzer","original_name":"Michael Filzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a036c3a368655b0026bc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114543,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harold Fleenor","original_name":"Harold Fleenor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a044c3a3686558003106","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114544,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jarett Melville","original_name":"Jarett Melville","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a05a0e0a26458c00262c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114545,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Neal","original_name":"Lisa Neal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a0640e0a26458c002640","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114541,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Feuerherd","original_name":"Edward Feuerherd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a07b0e0a2645990024fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114546,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Main","original_name":"Charles Main","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a08d92514159e4002570","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114551,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Fitzer","original_name":"Michael Fitzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a2550e0a264592002bec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114552,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Kowalewski","original_name":"Greg Kowalewski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a26992514159ea00272f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114544,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jarett Melville","original_name":"Jarett Melville","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b80a2770e0a264586002895","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tI5Bk4ibKOL6JYFN6BZfWjjKQkx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":179585,"name":"american civil war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
