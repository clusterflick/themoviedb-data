Boris, one of the students, thinks it would be a better idea a to make a film that uses existing recordings of the opera, but with a new story based on the ancient Greek myth about a young man in love with his own reflection in the lake. The relations between the students involved in the project and the surrounding events meld with the plot of this potential film, accentuating the various narcissism and the overall inability to suppress vanity and find real human contact.","popularity":0.3059,"poster_path":"/bWo0MItDyKB13kefBUjOkRuAhHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94024,"logo_path":null,"name":"EHO","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2011-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narcissus and Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milutin Milošević","original_name":"Milutin Milošević","popularity":0.2223,"profile_path":"/fN3blBalOuvMKwzUl41wMEtjY2c.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b7f355f0e0a2660a80011b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladislava Đorđević","original_name":"Vladislava Đorđević","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b7f35709251416c8c000ed6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Vlastelica","original_name":"Boris Vlastelica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b7f35789251416c94000f7a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amra Latifić","original_name":"Amra Latifić","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b7f357e0e0a26609d000f87","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jelena Šušnjar","original_name":"Jelena Šušnjar","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b7f3586c3a3687e0700105f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrijana Gavrilović","original_name":"Andrijana Gavrilović","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b7f35939251416c82001071","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milena Milutinović","original_name":"Milena Milutinović","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b7f35cac3a3687e1600129d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radmilo Petrović","original_name":"Radmilo Petrović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narcis","credit_id":"5b8077f5c3a3686551000588","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Đorđević","original_name":"Anja Đorđević","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Eho","credit_id":"5b80780892514159ce000045","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aneta Ilić","original_name":"Aneta Ilić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Nimfa I","credit_id":"5b80781592514159e000007a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivana Dimitrijević","original_name":"Ivana Dimitrijević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Nimfa II","credit_id":"5b80782192514159e700003b","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1054743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saša Radojević","original_name":"Saša Radojević","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7f34ce0e0a2660a0001029","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1054743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saša Radojević","original_name":"Saša Radojević","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7f34c70e0a2660ab001113","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2175813","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bWo0MItDyKB13kefBUjOkRuAhHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2036,"name":"greek mythology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
