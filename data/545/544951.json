This 10-minute music video follows the parallel journeys of the Dorothy character in each adaptation as they both get whisked away in the same tornado, land in their respective versions of Oz, and follow their own yellow brick road. Their stories are interwoven as the two classic versions are combined through their well-loved scores, and sung by some of the greatest voices on Broadway.","popularity":0.4545,"poster_path":"/avo3zx8U1auJYDJE4d8WBOwwslY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ease on down & over the rainbow to a magical musical mashup.","title":"The Oz Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Rockwell","original_name":"Kate Rockwell","popularity":0.1238,"profile_path":"/qxtgtopQKnaPwaO8zZ1h7S1d9UA.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"5b8417e592514159d703f11a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brynn Williams","original_name":"Brynn Williams","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"5b841808c3a368655b04134f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Barrett","original_name":"Sean Barrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b84194292514159e003e357","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt DiCarlo","original_name":"Matt DiCarlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b841980c3a3686555049ee9","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116399,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Michael Webb","original_name":"Jason Michael Webb","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8419fcc3a3686558053c34","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116400,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Harkness","original_name":"James Harkness","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b841a27c3a368656003fd4e","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116401,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Krueger","original_name":"Walter Krueger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b841a5a92514159d903fdbf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
