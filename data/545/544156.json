Fascinated by his iconic painting Christina's World, Palin goes in search of the real life stories that inspired this and Wyeth's other depictions of the American landscape and its hard grafting inhabitants. Tracking down the farmers, friends and family featured in Wyeth's magically real work, Palin builds a picture of an eccentric, enigmatic and driven painter. He also gets a rare interview with Helga, the woman who put Wyeth back in the headlines when the press discovered he had been painting her nude, compulsively but secretly for 15 years.","popularity":0.5605,"poster_path":"/hXPa0eI0hGUiC1c3bf5grQH6b6P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Michael Palin heads for rural Pennsylvania and Maine to explore the extraordinary life and work of one of America's most popular and controversial painters, Andrew Wyeth.","title":"Michael Palin In Wyeth's World","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Palin","original_name":"Michael Palin","popularity":1.0055,"profile_path":"/7qCp6M2NxMWpUmO2t6IqHGNlBjz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b7ef6b892514104e601ac01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Wyeth","original_name":"Andrew Wyeth","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b7ef6cd92514104e90197e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Testorf","original_name":"Helga Testorf","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b7efe2692514104e901a0c6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3240348,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laura Wilson","original_name":"Laura Wilson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647692f300508a0116d4f603","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleanor Yule","original_name":"Eleanor Yule","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7ef6eb92514104e901981f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Palin","original_name":"Michael Palin","popularity":1.0055,"profile_path":"/7qCp6M2NxMWpUmO2t6IqHGNlBjz.jpg","credit_id":"5b7ef701c3a368340601f94a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113725,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mhairi McNeill","original_name":"Mhairi McNeill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7ef73792514104f6019b81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248327,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Franny Moyle","original_name":"Franny Moyle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7efe4ac3a368340b0168f7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113735,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Grandison","original_name":"Susan Grandison","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7efe64c3a3683406020476","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1528155,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Malcolm Lindsay","original_name":"Malcolm Lindsay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7eff020e0a2615cc01abb3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664582,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlo D'Alessandro","original_name":"Carlo D'Alessandro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7eff170e0a2615ba01c819","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleanor Yule","original_name":"Eleanor Yule","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7f05d50e0a2615c501c50c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3435334","wikidata_id":"Q28404603","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x1TME5vY9r2yF6PA8TlhrIWkmqz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pieErQW08SHXVfYqlgrItBW9UoP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hXPa0eI0hGUiC1c3bf5grQH6b6P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":2936,"name":"artists' life"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":41393,"name":"new england"},{"id":220933,"name":"fine art"},{"id":237806,"name":"american art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
