He was, literally, in the inmate audience in 1959, when Johnny Cash gave his New Year’s Day concert in San Quentin – and, as he’s said repeatedly, “my life changed forever.”","popularity":0.5244,"poster_path":"/lCsszpmHLGFFDmNAsFZJq6xUxIh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eagle Rock Film & TV Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":108110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spothouse GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merle Haggard: Learning to Live With Myself","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merle Haggard","original_name":"Merle Haggard","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/90TJcezbSylFYRU0JOwQOEgSRtW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b802c209251416c8e00f3f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Alvin","original_name":"Dave Alvin","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/75po2SNefjLmokc64As0kQgidBb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b802c2b0e0a26609a011c12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Duvall","original_name":"Robert Duvall","popularity":1.9616,"profile_path":"/ybMmK25h4IVtfE7qrnlVp47RQlh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b802c489251416c8c00ef62","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Richards","original_name":"Keith Richards","popularity":0.7344,"profile_path":"/t1oa5UsJMmrhNqCIks4jQnAYSQT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b802c520e0a26609d010c33","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Fogerty","original_name":"John Fogerty","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/7PIE1qufWgzCsGp4MGLCg18UmyO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b802c789251416c8e00f451","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Krauss","original_name":"Alison Krauss","popularity":0.3743,"profile_path":"/59wUTJ5BjjRIztFq5xRwnevRha4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b802c8a0e0a26609d010c65","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gandulf Hennig","original_name":"Gandulf Hennig","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/eRNK1DEzH5vasrEU6JgT706N5sg.jpg","credit_id":"5b802cad9251416c9700f035","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gandulf Hennig","original_name":"Gandulf Hennig","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/eRNK1DEzH5vasrEU6JgT706N5sg.jpg","credit_id":"5b802cb90e0a2660af0108f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1660396","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lCsszpmHLGFFDmNAsFZJq6xUxIh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":727,"name":"country music"},{"id":196599,"name":"rebelliousness"},{"id":247085,"name":"bakersfield"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
