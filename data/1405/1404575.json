Cunningham reflects upon her life in photography, and shares her thoughts about feminism, work, marriage, old age and death--all conveyed with an irascible humor that sustained and fortified her throughout her long life. Showcasing many of Cunningham's photos, this film is a tribute to her life and legacy.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Give Up: Imogen Cunningham","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Hershey","original_name":"Ann Hershey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676317fe8d1cfdc5224a3894","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5127806,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George F.
