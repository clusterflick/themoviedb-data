Ho Chi Minh changed many identities, held the most menial jobs and traveled the world. The film is a work about representation and iconography, following the immanence of an image in the places where it is evoked. In this case it is the image of a historical character, which is diluted in images of the past and present of those places that he contributed to modifying.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ho Chi Minh learns ten words a day","title":"Hết","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5127134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Torresagasti","original_name":"Santiago Torresagasti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6762b6b88d1cfdc5224a2ce4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
