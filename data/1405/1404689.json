Through gestures, Aoyagi introduces us to the different individuals who work at Mirai, as well as their distinct talents and personalities. In the process, he constructs an exemplary documentary about life with a disability, one that does not treat those filmed as “subjects,” but rather as friends with whom to occupy their own space, alongside those who care and encourage us to see the world with kindness.","popularity":0.1746,"poster_path":"/vZgk1WNgeTfAvrVMyyjzA4urHBd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fujiyama Cotton","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Fujiyama Cottonton","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3412950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taku Aoyagi","original_name":"Taku Aoyagi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67635f49713e9ff45bab12cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5128243,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mitsumasa Yamanome","original_name":"Mitsumasa Yamanome","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67635f89178bde9bac4a3863","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q128867467","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1129,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZgk1WNgeTfAvrVMyyjzA4urHBd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162735,"name":"disability"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Semaine de la critique de Montréal 2025","release_date":"2025-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"『フジヤマコットントン』予告編","key":"z6u3mX3tlEI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-16T11:13:54.000Z","id":"67659938aff5a7d64174aac1"}]}}}
