Have potato broth for lunch. Return to milking in the afternoon. At night he listens to the radio until he falls asleep.  Every day the same routine. Jacobo retraces his steps without looking at a landscape that he knows by heart, until the day when this landscape is disturbed by a strange presence, an impossible object that forces Jacobo to stop, to look. Something breaks in Jacobo's predictable world.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/xx7tVLHfaco9tqlQiJ8a3qCcGqb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deus Ex Máquina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalia Santa","original_name":"Natalia Santa","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67621626a0cc3de647ffd5ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xx7tVLHfaco9tqlQiJ8a3qCcGqb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
