People from the south know the island by rumors that link Friendship to  miraculous healings and UFO phenomena.  Toto Island is part of the same archipelago to which Shingo traveled with an improvised manual for basic communication,  containing ready made phrases in Spanish regarding the purpose of his trip.  The manual, an old radio and his video camera would be the only means to establish contacts and collect information  on the Friendship enigma.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6XwHSngZWC5WVF9D57giTq8JjfK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do you know about Friendship Island?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Que savez-vous de l'île Friendship ?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5127200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shingo Yoshida","original_name":"Shingo Yoshida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6762c0ac63853659bd4a2628","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/6XwHSngZWC5WVF9D57giTq8JjfK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"65th Festival de Cannes -  Short Film Corner","release_date":"2012-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
