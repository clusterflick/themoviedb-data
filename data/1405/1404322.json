It sounds boring to me!\" His comment results in a special dream where he learns that in Christ, he is truly special and that Heaven is so much more than he ever imagined.\r Film maker Kevin Cushing wrote and directed this film after his own tragically funny teaching experience with a group of Junior High students. A delightful original music score by David Maddux, winner of the best musical score award for a 1982 film release, complements the funny but meaningful story.\r Heavensent employs a unique combination of black and white and color film techniques. Chris' everyday world is portrayed in black and white and Heaven is seen in vivid full color.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavensent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Cushing","original_name":"Kevin Cushing","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67628947e14e3bcfa74a22be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
