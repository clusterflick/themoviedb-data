A novelist who is retreating for peace and quiet at his summer home in the woods. We follow him through his abrupt writer's block where nothing he writes seems to be good enough. Soon after he hears music coming from the forest and is later acquainted with Daisy, who is a mystical child. She mimics George's self conscious and brings him back on the road to creativity, through reminding him of a much simpler time when he was a kid.","popularity":0.1254,"poster_path":"/kxO6lHyftbdiHhiuPkcvXaDqN8W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daisy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5126090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caden Espinoza","original_name":"Caden Espinoza","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6761f7fb59514a54ccce833d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5126093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Pepin","original_name":"Alex Pepin","popularity":0.074,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6761f8327398eff191ce8342","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3295317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Petsa","original_name":"Olga Petsa","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/se8aEDWlXxipmOEExncUvwqY6jJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6761f83c7398eff191ce834d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Santiago V치zquez Gayt치n","original_name":"Santiago V치zquez Gayt치n","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6761f8fd3ccf4182dc084e7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1315,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/znWCDkn6QLwgD7a4sa0UmkH00Hp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2338}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kxO6lHyftbdiHhiuPkcvXaDqN8W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
