It's a film-trip or, as it's called today, a road movie. The road to the war is a greater ordeal  than a battle… In an unprecedented march the forty-thousand strong Bulgarian Army, crossing from the southern to the western frontier of the country, covers the distance in less than two days and two nights with no roads, railway or other means of transport available… and wins the war. But this seemingly chaotic whirl of events will clearly follow the path of a young woman from the grave of her child to the death of her husband. And there will be the Cripple – a boy with his romantic urge to die for his Fatherland dying in the most important battle in life – for human dignity. There are also the bodies of two men clinging to each other in Death’s grip among the reeds in the mud. The war has made them enemies but they are more like bleeding Atlas Telamons with a peaceful sky steady on their shoulders.","popularity":0.3939,"poster_path":"/8M4mvanwtlnpdJz3EmWaChh5t8x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74701,"logo_path":"/tXlAkHJqG0Vf8fPnRPKwskEJlDK.png","name":"BNT","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":140788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kulev Film Production","origin_country":""},{"id":56274,"logo_path":"/gYlXPHs3WK6DU5aST0mohdJJj9q.png","name":"Shibuya Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2019-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once There Was a War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Imalo edna voyna","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsvetan Aleksiev","original_name":"Tsvetan Aleksiev","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6ef5339affc000360d5c23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Avramov","original_name":"Phillip Avramov","popularity":0.1968,"profile_path":"/mAPr1GuuH6NHqjrdBkS2K2shprw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6ef53889b5610039207d72","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Cross","original_name":"Ben Cross","popularity":0.6728,"profile_path":"/11gObExUG7lFCA7WeYgHabnZjDg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6ef53e7aecc60036d03f2e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Finzi","original_name":"Samuel Finzi","popularity":0.2817,"profile_path":"/pCMO1RAgikPaCt9wTOBnSZ2iM2S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6ef5467aecc60037d1ac77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1254441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luiza Grigorova","original_name":"Luiza Grigorova","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/c8VM8fvASiigvq4L2orQvb3VnUO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6ef54bd55e4d00357beb66","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2792217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anri Kulev","original_name":"Anri Kulev","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/2GOerdNJUznVteEX4W3pZtcVsSp.jpg","credit_id":"5f6ef5557aecc60039d2e509","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladi Kirov","original_name":"Vladi Kirov","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6ef55dd55e4d0034712f2b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11344634","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rN5iKI7YjsjUljf83wR8bZ0B8ek.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"bg","file_path":"/8M4mvanwtlnpdJz3EmWaChh5t8x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
