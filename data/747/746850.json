It’s an insight into the free and inclusive spirit of a unique environment, in which the social norms imposed on our daily lives no longer apply. The message behind the film is as inspirational as aspirational. Rhonda is a lifestyle open to anyone brave enough to be themselves, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. It’s an invitation to break away from the limits pre-established by society and to question how we look at family, roles and social structures.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/jUIzwKwLGNVy7voMeDWAkoPGvxH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Club Called Rhonda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2791897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Ferro","original_name":"Greg Ferro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6e76d2d55e4d00377f7f10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUIzwKwLGNVy7voMeDWAkoPGvxH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
