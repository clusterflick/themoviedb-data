The film follows a compulsive collector as he tracks down a specific artifact that was involved in the brutal murder of a young woman. The journey leads him to a reclusive online vendor--a man whose unexpected offer forces the collector to confront the nature of his obsession.","popularity":0.091,"poster_path":"/23p6ZFz6tvESdpQrUfvCtrJ7DTr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murderabilia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Broughton","original_name":"Kevin Broughton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gordon Wymms","credit_id":"5f6ea8e49f37b000355b364d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Opie Cooper","original_name":"Opie Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shopkeeper","credit_id":"5f6ea8fcea3949003a3e5d74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Miller","original_name":"Tracy Miller","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/nmyNWHyuEwy36PYYsMUZGsthwfP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Collector","credit_id":"5f6ea93389b561003a20c204","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Matthews","original_name":"David Matthews","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6E9xfkkE0X5XNrZB5GceHbr2RHJ.jpg","credit_id":"612bfc15bf09d1006003a904","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miriam Lamar","original_name":"Miriam Lamar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6eaa1a7314a100339461eb","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryan Roy","original_name":"Ryan Roy","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6ea8c4d55e4d00357a5b1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792036,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rick Moore","original_name":"Rick Moore","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6ea9aae267de0034352803","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792040,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Duncan","original_name":"David Duncan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6ea9ec7314a1003495428b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792038,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Usry","original_name":"Michael Usry","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6ea9c47aecc60039d1587b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryan Roy","original_name":"Ryan Roy","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6ea9b7f2cf2500378bbc9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Matthews","original_name":"David Matthews","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6E9xfkkE0X5XNrZB5GceHbr2RHJ.jpg","credit_id":"5f6ea98b7aecc60038cedfc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Matthews","original_name":"David Matthews","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6E9xfkkE0X5XNrZB5GceHbr2RHJ.jpg","credit_id":"5f6ea95b7aecc60039d15541","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1719525","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/23p6ZFz6tvESdpQrUfvCtrJ7DTr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
