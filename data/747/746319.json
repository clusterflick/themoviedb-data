When the family's tutor, in love with the girl, gets lucky at the gambling table, he tries to rescue her from her desperate situation, but she outright rejects him.  Prokofiev's first full-length opera The Gambler, based on Dostoyevsky's partly autobiographical novella ironically written to settle gambling debts, is rarely performed today. This 2020 production brings together director Vasily Barkhatov and conductor Modestas Pitrenas and stars the winner of the 2019 International Opera Award, Asmik Grigorian, in the role of Polina.","popularity":0.202,"poster_path":"/q8WBoTf39d0ph2D4HN7j5i4UaZA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prokofiev: The Gambler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitrij Golovnin","original_name":"Dmitrij Golovnin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alexey","credit_id":"5f6c5eb6fbe36f003851e136","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asmik Grigorian","original_name":"Asmik Grigorian","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":"/1OSKsFOKC3cUq6H1yb2tWfHWNzM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Polina","credit_id":"5f6c5ebddbcade003838595a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimiras Prudnikovas","original_name":"Vladimiras Prudnikovas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The General","credit_id":"5f6c5ec4e267de0035230837","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ieva Prudnikovaitė","original_name":"Ieva Prudnikovaitė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Blanche","credit_id":"5f6c5ecb8d1b8e0037bb93c8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Pavilionis","original_name":"Tomas Pavilionis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Marquis","credit_id":"5f6c5ed3d55e4d003571c3a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steponas Zonys","original_name":"Steponas Zonys","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Astley","credit_id":"5f6c5edbcb5c8e0037e50c01","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arunas Malikenas","original_name":"Arunas Malikenas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Baron Würmerhelm","credit_id":"6743ae40dae2e6a93825cb35","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2524829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafailas Karpis","original_name":"Rafailas Karpis","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Prince Nilsky","credit_id":"6743ae54fb58d769bdbbea54","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inesa Linaburgytė","original_name":"Inesa Linaburgytė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The General’s aunt","credit_id":"6743ae67fb58d769bdbbea6c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arminas Skirvainis","original_name":"Arminas Skirvainis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Potapitsch","credit_id":"6743ae7d68823004ca9cb39e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmundas Seilius","original_name":"Edmundas Seilius","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"The First Croupier","credit_id":"6743ae9168823004ca9cb3b3","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juozas Janužas","original_name":"Juozas Janužas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"The 2nd Croupier","credit_id":"6743aea668823004ca9cb3c5","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasily Barkhatov","original_name":"Vasily Barkhatov","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c5ef7e267de0034294be4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790146,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modestas Pitrėnas","original_name":"Modestas Pitrėnas","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c5eedd55e4d00366e6093","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8WBoTf39d0ph2D4HN7j5i4UaZA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
