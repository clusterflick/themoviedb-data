Here is the “potentiality” at stake in Dana Berman Duff’s film, developed in two movements. First movement: words, framed in extreme close-up shots, cut out from what appears to be a newspaper page, as can be guessed from the greyish, see-through paper and the black ink of the printed letters. Words read in silence, traces of the rumble of international news. Second movement: how can one testify, bear witness for the witness, as Celan says? When they were prisoners at Theresienstadt concentration camp, now known as a showcase and an instrument of propaganda meant to hide the reality of extermination, musician Viktor Ullmann and librettist Peter Kien, who were later killed in Auschwitz, composed an opera in 1943-44: Der Kaiser von Atlantis.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":"/gCDkyvbPkL1oJIOgQtpkiA7E3Mc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A POTENTIALITY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Berman Duff","original_name":"Dana Berman Duff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6cfe188d1b8e0037becb96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gCDkyvbPkL1oJIOgQtpkiA7E3Mc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDMarseilles Festival","release_date":"2020-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ultracinema X","release_date":"2021-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
