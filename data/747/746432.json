Convinced that the loss was the result of the umpire’s missed call, she has since spiraled downward, a bottle of alcohol her constant companion. Buoyed by the unflagging enthusiasm of her son Matthias, who eagerly awaits her comeback, Annbritt is persuaded to train for a rematch against her old rival, in true Rocky Balboa style. But is the embittered, often-pickled aging athlete up to the challenge? Oscar nominee Patrik Eklund’s offbeat comedy with a heart holds out the hope that life just possibly might offer second chances.","popularity":0.0864,"poster_path":"/nsJXlXiYAuDVUlV4zgliVlaGvTJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Comeback","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":986759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrik Eklund","original_name":"Patrik Eklund","popularity":0.2042,"profile_path":"/g7FbCejLVOsWP3XIwBCpS7PoKxt.jpg","credit_id":"5f6cd008325a5100376945e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1120,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nsJXlXiYAuDVUlV4zgliVlaGvTJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
