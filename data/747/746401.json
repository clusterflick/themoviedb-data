First she seems a bit ridiculous, self-sufficient and naive, a potential victim, an circus animal, but she comes out as something else. Kristal is a weird saint, who takes to bear all the hate, despair, lust and confusion around her and through that gives people a momentary relief.","popularity":0.2504,"poster_path":"/2NGGuGGJsHjL5hqCTfJOexxrBTi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106557,"logo_path":"/i6mhfVriXTap9whFMrc8guJNODR.png","name":"Elokuvayhtiö Komeetta","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2020-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kristal","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Küttner","original_name":"Katja Küttner","popularity":0.1661,"profile_path":"/obVqMkmdAj60vYArRv7UFB3oqWU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kristal","credit_id":"5f6dbecde627190038122813","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1528723,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aarne Tapola","original_name":"Aarne Tapola","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uSS6BI1Ox9fIuNKt9oqQeRBOehM.jpg","credit_id":"63a05e64c8f3c40085268f22","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zaida Bergroth","original_name":"Zaida Bergroth","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/fx4OCpCElnPdACapY2uwPnsP7Ra.jpg","credit_id":"5f6cb3b2d55e4d00366ef683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Kuitunen","original_name":"Daniel Kuitunen","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6dbeddcf48a10038d369f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612439,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kari Kankaanpää","original_name":"Kari Kankaanpää","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6dbf10d55e4d003576ff82","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380791,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tiina Kaukanen","original_name":"Tiina Kaukanen","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6dbf1de267de0034309175","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295701,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lau Nau","original_name":"Lau Nau","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6dbf37a0b6900039495bba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2485898,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Kata Launonen","original_name":"Kata Launonen","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6dbf45a6e2d200395ffdfb","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302706,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Micke Nyström","original_name":"Micke Nyström","popularity":0.0514,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6dbf291fa1c8003512154e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zaida Bergroth","original_name":"Zaida Bergroth","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/fx4OCpCElnPdACapY2uwPnsP7Ra.jpg","credit_id":"5f6dbeeafbe36f00394ae5a4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488315,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eero Tammi","original_name":"Eero Tammi","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6dbf03cf48a10037d57489","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12504490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2NGGuGGJsHjL5hqCTfJOexxrBTi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":733,"name":"dancer"},{"id":163080,"name":"finland"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Helsinki International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
