But the turning point came in USA, with everything falling in Ferrari's favour. After China, Schumacher and Alonso were equal on points so the battle for both titles would be won and lost in the last two races.\r Look out for Button's fiery exit in Australia and his blaze of glory in Hungary. Ride on board with Liuzzi as Raikkonen drives over him! Feel the emotion as Massa wins in Brazil and Michael Schumacher bows out of Formula One after a charge through the field - a genius at his best.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jauEFaiohMCM503oAU7lDqZKHtn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":225,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Official Review of the 2006 FIA Formula One World Championship","title":"F1 Review 2006","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jauEFaiohMCM503oAU7lDqZKHtn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
