One morning, this homeless man is drunk and approaches director Lee for money. He is a doubtful character who is often in and out of the detention center and mentions Bresson, Ozu, and Ha Giljong. He claims to have been invited to the Venice International Film Festival and the Clermont-Ferrand Short Film Festival with his film Self-Portrait 2000. Self-Portrait 2020 is a record of strange friendships and a film of respect (homage) to a promising young film director of 20 years ago. Two directors, two films, and splendid credits.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":"/zY0JZvS0I8wPuhVTvmNhm62jSoV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-portrait 2020","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Selpeu-poteuleiteu 2020","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Dong-woo","original_name":"Lee Dong-woo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faab9641c0435003f385b6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Sang-yeol","original_name":"Lee Sang-yeol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faaba2263d71300439829e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheol Kim","original_name":"Cheol Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60bf7d4d0721660029e1345f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Han Hye-seong","original_name":"Han Hye-seong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bf7d70eb79c20029f8484e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Dong-woo","original_name":"Lee Dong-woo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c7861d55e4d003774c1b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14708580","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fc5ipv1D43vUxEK1Hc8HleLUSix.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1867},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qGui0BzW5K8wBJeeXc7NbePcK1U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1867}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/zY0JZvS0I8wPuhVTvmNhm62jSoV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#BIFF2020 Wide Angle - Self-portrait 2020 / 와이드 앵글 - 셀프-포트레이트 2020","key":"wT0tcV1HH1g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-23T09:00:21.000Z","id":"5f6c787afbe36f0037585835"}]}}}
