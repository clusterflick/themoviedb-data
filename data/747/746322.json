It concerns the wronged Euryanthe, victim of a plot to establish her unfaithfulness, but her love imbues her with colossal strength which Weber characterizes with acute psychological insight. Through-composed and dispensing with spoken dialogue, its chivalric plot provides opportunities for a series of arias, ariosos, duets, cavatinas and choruses that contain some of his greatest operatic music. This production employs the operas original version with a few, very minor cuts.","popularity":0.1076,"poster_path":"/qsEehxwwQwnG2G1cKIpmRZCiqmO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weber: Euryanthe","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Carl Maria von Weber - Euryanthe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacquelyn Wagner","original_name":"Jacquelyn Wagner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6c6088a0b690003859ee25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Reinhardt","original_name":"Norman Reinhardt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6c608fa6e2d200395d9b35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theresa Kronthaler","original_name":"Theresa Kronthaler","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6c6096e267de00352309d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Foster-Williams","original_name":"Andrew Foster-Williams","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6c609f46aed400388eb95f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Cerny","original_name":"Stefan Cerny","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6c60a6d2c0c100376d66fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Maria Neubauer","original_name":"Eva Maria Neubauer","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/meyvnJNi5dDxEpc5rheCVmlhEbi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6c60ae40d0fe00391eb132","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christof Loy","original_name":"Christof Loy","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c60c6a6e2d2003a6ca506","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790161,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Constantin Trinks","original_name":"Constantin Trinks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c60bad2c0c100356be837","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Landsmann","original_name":"Paul Landsmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729513f554578c90de31e94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christof Loy","original_name":"Christof Loy","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729514d0eb51c288758a605","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041216,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helmina von Chézy","original_name":"Helmina von Chézy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67295199008c8137852e1160","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsEehxwwQwnG2G1cKIpmRZCiqmO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-ray","release_date":"2020-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Carl Maria von Weber – Euryanthe (Theater an der Wien)","key":"b8ZT-U7YBE0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-12-16T08:55:59.000Z","id":"672951d6761979f005e2e554"}]}}}
