They were filled with great hopes and dreams of making it. By 1988 the band was still together, but life was intervening. The record deal, necessary for success at that time, kept eluding them. By 1993 they 'disbanded'. Then in 2007 the filmmaker went back to see what happened to them as individuals, to explore where the 'dream' of making it and the intense creativity of that time had taken them in their lives. This is not a typical BEHIND THE MUSIC story, but one that speaks to the resilience and resourcefulness that people can acquire in pursuing creative goals.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Don't Wanna Make You Dance","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2663556","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
