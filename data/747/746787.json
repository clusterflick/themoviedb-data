Jean-René runs a chocolate factory that is running out of steam, rather like his own existence. Both seek help from the usual sources: Jean-René favours self-help tapes and Angélique joins a support group, Les Émotifs Anonymes. Romantics Anonymous is an unusual and tender love story in which the obstacles to happiness are not the usual external barriers, but those sneaky little ones we know all too intimately: the ones within.","popularity":0.1598,"poster_path":"/71T69G10AZPUrM3plYJiqDLl6oT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wise
