The conclusions were startling. Kim Feenstra set out to find out what progress has been made within the Youth Care system since then and ended up in a circle of grief and pain dominated by money, power and powerlessness. In her search, Kim Feenstra spoke to many people involved. The stories can be described as downright shocking. In many cases Youth Care appears to act as a revenue model that is exploiting parents and children. The complex system has only one entrance, but the exit is obstructed by all stakeholders who want to maintain their revenue model. The people who really matter, the parents and children, encounter a power block of inhuman proportions. A system dominated by money, power and powerlessness.","popularity":0.1215,"poster_path":"/jtBpYRbatuw5IdjrilCshLOkqEO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205310,"logo_path":"/6743Pg05Mnq3dxpD3MNwp8lsnMH.png","name":"DOCSFAIR","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":205311,"logo_path":"/5DIo3BNpYhzR5XrwvXCHxnJKV4.png","name":"indepen","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taken
