He is interested in the universe, planets, unknown creatures â€“ and in tardigrades, those tiny multicellular organisms that look like dust bags on legs and are real survival artists. Quite unlike humans, as Rovin points out, because the latter are sure to die out one day. He sees this as a logical fact, not a threat. And when you open yourself up to the grainy, earthy images and the calm narrative, you eventually stop wondering, too, why that should be a problem. After all, as long as the wind blows through the trees and scatters the tardigrades, everything is in good order. In addition to the captivatingly alert boy, Renninger meets Marie, who knows everything about rocks, and Christopher, who decorates a place with these rocks. They are all on a quest and every day find a piece of what one cannot hold onto: the present.","popularity":0.2418,"poster_path":"/lPmRsZCKxsM7RuWazqZIJj6Memk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wind Is Taking Them","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Carolin Renninger","original_name":"Ann Carolin Renninger","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6528f0c01f3e6000c5885c92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1103,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPmRsZCKxsM7RuWazqZIJj6Memk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":781}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Dok Leipzig 2023","release_date":"2023-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
