Beginning in rural Virginia, their journey to the front lines of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War is more than a testament to their bravery - it's a reflection of their indomitable spirit and unyielding resolve.

With cinematic finesse fit for a global streaming audience, the film weaves personal narratives into a rich tapestry, culminating in an epic saga of heroism, perseverance, and the enduring legacy of the American veteran.","popularity":1.2445,"poster_path":"/iDs3JVNRQVOyzPYoFghgvi3hgrj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""},{"id":203130,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Boeing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Amidst world wars and racial divides, the Montford Point Marines rise, battling prejudice and enemy fire as “Triumph Over Prejudice\" illuminates their overlooked heroism, enduring spirit, and the legacy they carved for future generations.","title":"Triumph Over Prejudice: The Montford Point Marines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4319051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrol Braxton","original_name":"Carrol Braxton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Carrol Braxton","credit_id":"65297a80544c410dd82dbef9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4319052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph H.
