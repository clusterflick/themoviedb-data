She has talent that makes him jealous, but she doesn’t seem to notice it herself. He has matureness that she admires, but he doesn’t seem to care about it. Sometimes close and sometimes distant, they attempt to establish a relationship not possessive, yet mutually comforting. However, the loss of distance makes them eventually become strangers. Five years later, the woman has become a novice writer. She brings her debut work — based on her previous experiences — to meet the man and try to put an end to the past.","popularity":0.0845,"poster_path":"/cgTKvDk5W2PO359fAaaa6cQ8Q8l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With or Without You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4316839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zheng Jing Ru","original_name":"郑静茹","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/quUm8ODF6BBgIhKgvKy2f8hQSdD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6527b06e0cb33516f63d2bed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"阎三元","original_name":"阎三元","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"665b72e0bd63c3a820364281","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4932875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Chow","original_name":"Carmen Chow","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/1yICFScB9Ye6bo2UYaJdp9iOxI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Wang Xuetong","credit_id":"66df2011bea4c3b2126d5b6e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4316835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feng Yi","original_name":"Feng Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527af93cb6db5013aa1e8a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4316835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feng Yi","original_name":"Feng Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527b0230cb33516f881b47a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4316835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feng Yi","original_name":"Feng Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527b028fd63005d7d928b3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4316835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feng Yi","original_name":"Feng Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527b0341f3e6000ac4cb726","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4316835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feng Yi","original_name":"Feng Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527b041ea84c7012d6e8890","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29256478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.469,"height":1846,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/p5LWtUL7KVaddQVHtzaxCUHy3ZV.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":6403},{"aspect_ratio":3.469,"height":1846,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/9msDjZFXfDt3W55vclGmpUkvVp6.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":6403}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cgTKvDk5W2PO359fAaaa6cQ8Q8l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pingyao International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
