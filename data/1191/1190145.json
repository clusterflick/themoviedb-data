For them, it's not just revisiting old grounds but also processing their trauma and honoring the fallen. Hanoi, now unrecognizable, has healed from war's wounds. Former military prisons attract tourists, a once-bloody siege site is now a coffee plantation, and former enemies embrace the veterans. Throughout their journey, the veterans rediscover Vietnam's resilience, visiting haunting sites and forming an unbreakable bond. This documentary captures their profound journey, uniting them and showcasing Vietnam's remarkable transformation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9AypOBhLOc2kVaBENltr6wpywA2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Left As Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5144248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Amelio","original_name":"Ray Amelio","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jL1qvkPdSUoEQ8izxGdru30tlRp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676f157cd0b08f97186165dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Foreman","original_name":"Stephen Foreman","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iJ6ByWuDri8ii4jcy93qmQ2yIXT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676f15f462ba310fc012dfe7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5144244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Nigut","original_name":"Andy Nigut","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ec9U0PuXlaiBF9VbTgzX2wv7bhQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676f1532fb8a229c67927dff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5144242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Nudi","original_name":"Louis Nudi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1nGigSsEpzTBL2fmk42N18JZRz9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676f15053dff0de99b618585","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Woods","original_name":"Larry Woods","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/crCvXHSfuU4G9PAbq1s9kT5wCpY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676f15dcd6d10ecc8c12c68b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Wright","original_name":"Ben Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vInBIWFwFbk1yfKmHYwdc2CAya.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676f15671efc2434cf12bfab","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1729870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Evan Mulgrave","original_name":"Evan Mulgrave","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f253cf9454eeb1d92b2cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28633505","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9AypOBhLOc2kVaBENltr6wpywA2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
