In 40 years, it has established itself as an iconic and legendary Melbourne staple among the Inner-North's queer scene. But neither Rose Chong's nor fancy-dress are as simple as they first seem according to Dan, one of the long-time \"Chongettes\" who works there. When considered with care and attention, they reveal glittering ideas of play and fun and community. From a queer lens - or rather, a mirror - this unassuming costume shop is a place where one might begin to conceive truths about themselves and their identities. How to Dress Like Me is a 5-minute documentary that contends with the intersections of play, queerness, and clothes.","popularity":0.3798,"poster_path":"/tq5I9wFbRZlRfunRmoc9I3eiWnx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Become Yourself","title":"How To Dress Like Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Knight","original_name":"Dan Knight","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65280ac8fd63005d7a2d7005","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Cutherbertson","original_name":"Hannah Cutherbertson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65280ad90cb33516f5c82d31","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Dixon-Dunn","original_name":"Jack Dixon-Dunn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65280af83780620139a11cb6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Chong","original_name":"Rose Chong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65280b0b629b2c0139a89701","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317308,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Alvarez","original_name":"Aaron Alvarez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280bda1f3e6000ff847e4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317316,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Alvarez","original_name":"Jonathan Alvarez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280c0d1f3e6000ac4cdff0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rohan Spong","original_name":"Rohan Spong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280c2a629b2c0139a89791","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317339,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aaron Alvarez","original_name":"Aaron Alvarez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280e67ea84c7014e03b968","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juanita Ebbs","original_name":"Juanita Ebbs","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280e18813831011b4952ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juanita Ebbs","original_name":"Juanita Ebbs","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280bcb3780620139a11d20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Alvarez","original_name":"Aaron Alvarez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280e2bea84c700eba094ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juanita Ebbs","original_name":"Juanita Ebbs","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65280e51df857c0101d568d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29482203","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k2CYo8IejgieOIAO0y3m7wMfT5Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tq5I9wFbRZlRfunRmoc9I3eiWnx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":895,"name":"optimism"},{"id":213040,"name":"self reflection"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"},{"id":270677,"name":"costume"},{"id":320807,"name":"australian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Screened at Melbourne Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How To Dress Like Me - Trailer","key":"RxaGTYniDrw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-29T03:32:50.000Z","id":"653dd2f6519bbb00fe5cb062"}]}}}
