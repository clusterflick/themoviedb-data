Every now and then, driven by no one knows what need, she goes down the seafront and waits. When a car stops, she gets in. Davide Heller is a successful criminal lawyer. He lives alone in a large apartment, he is a young, handsome, taciturn man. He too has always had a secret. Their meeting is like a faulty bomb that never goes off. One morning Davide Heller leaves home in a jogging outfit, with a big backpack on his shoulders: inside, the corpse of a little girl. Celeste follows him and from then on, she’ll never let go of him… In a crescendo of tension, their two ordinary and sick existences mirror each other noiselessly. Until the end.","popularity":0.2487,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Want to Watch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1788969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Muselli","original_name":"Arturo Muselli","popularity":0.2363,"profile_path":"/ifz7ANMgMR8iP1BkZZheGMe1wEx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Davide Heller","credit_id":"663ac9967e49dbb735d75139","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1668746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimiliano Rossi","original_name":"Massimiliano Rossi","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/3kgkMSYty4mqBVLCO70b3gXtPnh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"663ac9aaaa09c57cb2be9c90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4700496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiamma Parente","original_name":"Fiamma Parente","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Celeste","credit_id":"663ac9edd05c021a7bd75077","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Diego De Silva","original_name":"Diego De Silva","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/ebSJ5lw4EE3jKglGopGPwjAPnQ9.jpg","credit_id":"6528357a629b2c00e266d182","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Incerti","original_name":"Stefano Incerti","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652835500cb33516f881e7ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18289386","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
