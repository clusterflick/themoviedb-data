In the first half of 2023 alone, almost 2,000 people died in the Mediterranean because the European Union’s border policy systematically violates existing laws. Instead of helping shipwrecked persons, Frontex practices illegal pushbacks, finances the violent operations of the Libyan coast guard and takes massive action against private sea rescue missions that act where the EU fails. All this has been documented in the media and yet remains incomprehensible to all who were never forced to live through this situation themselves: How can one deny assistance to hundreds of people in peril of life, even threaten and criminalise the civilian helpers?","popularity":0.0935,"poster_path":"/zIzf2sAmSH0033WmbI2RhNWpZ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241963,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.N TV-Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Hundred Four","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"One Hundred Four","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"One Hundred Four","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3410924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claus-Peter Reisch","original_name":"Claus-Peter Reisch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zJAQ0RdApdCGgNouBlqXLLdLvby.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6658732fd8f807cefa505ed5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Schörnig","original_name":"Jonathan Schörnig","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n2QgwNSUusLVEohKjTCnvvcSDRd.jpg","credit_id":"652ae9e5024ec8011e3370ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uwe Nitschke","original_name":"Uwe Nitschke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae9fb1511aa00c68b25f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320621,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Then","original_name":"Adrian Then","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652aea0aea84c700eba1ad07","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320622,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Johannes Filous","original_name":"Johannes Filous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652aea15ea84c7010c1bac27","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320623,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Moritz Petzold","original_name":"Moritz Petzold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652aea21ea84c7010c1bac34","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Schörnig","original_name":"Jonathan Schörnig","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n2QgwNSUusLVEohKjTCnvvcSDRd.jpg","credit_id":"6528f59cae6f09011d30a3f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Schörnig","original_name":"Jonathan Schörnig","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n2QgwNSUusLVEohKjTCnvvcSDRd.jpg","credit_id":"6566fd61a8b2ca00ad386bed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p1yucCp51z5euG5ixRLWf7tpknf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qtmf0lxstbdFklnPqydT4KY9QQi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zIzf2sAmSH0033WmbI2RhNWpZ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1219},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dDJ42uenAfo5Nfdw49CWRnM9mSC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/4vGnm4DE6wl6EW8CqNjXc2ho1IN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK.fest München ","release_date":"2024-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK Leipzig ","release_date":"2023-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
