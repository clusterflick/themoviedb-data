Meandering through a cut-out computer-animated forest we come upon strangers enacting odd and playful rituals. These live-action sequences are loose reenactments of 1960’s and 1970’s performance artworks restaged in an Arcadian setting. The ecstatic jouissance of the original performances, with their primitivist nudity, shamanistic catharsis and pointed immediacy is re-located to a fabulous storybook world.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/fXAQFOHFlShsDoudt4GhX9CPJWd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Happiest Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janine Biunno","original_name":"Janine Biunno","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6528d3410cb33516f7468918","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Cato","original_name":"Christine Cato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6528d35b700bf7011dd3c05f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark D.
