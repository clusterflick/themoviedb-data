The inimitable Richard Massingham, a doctor turned actor and filmmaker, co-directed this film, and appears in it as the testy Mr Proctor.  This film was produced by John Grierson, often hailed as the father of British documentary. It was made for the General Post Office (GPO) Film Unit, one of the most remarkable creative institutions that Britain has produced. It provided a springboard for many of the best-known and critically acclaimed figures in the British Documentary Movement.”  - BFI","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":"/ffLLSioDclKjym5lRBMLN0sQ0g3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15557,"logo_path":null,"name":"GPO Film Unit","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1937-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daily Round","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Grierson","original_name":"John Grierson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/fVn3DN0fuvw7N4neRs1QxOqBH5F.jpg","credit_id":"6529b0911f3e6000ff8527d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Massingham","original_name":"Richard Massingham","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":"/j65rdOPcm4zEGFkvJUS4XSFpSrS.jpg","credit_id":"6529b087ea84c700aef1f0d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4724799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Herbert Murrill","original_name":"Herbert Murrill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c7bc266db97059e1c3b6fc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cavalcanti","original_name":"Alberto Cavalcanti","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/wb9sB74uuEkc5mo5hALCzAG7HgT.jpg","credit_id":"66c7bbdd79fe141e0eea7e06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":985174,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Diamond","original_name":"George Diamond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c7bcb415de5a55a7eabccc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4899798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Urbahn","original_name":"Karl Urbahn","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c7bb6d64d05e0f08d1a330","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ffLLSioDclKjym5lRBMLN0sQ0g3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
