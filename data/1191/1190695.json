Invited by his mute friend Boots, Jack explores the stranger parts of the apartment with emphatic glee. Peter Alfred Runsible, the uninvited guest, is on a quest to retrieve all of his belongings after a frustrating breakup with the long standing tenant Shelby Denehee. Her girlfriend Bonnie Watt has made a feast for the eyes and guts of all these broken people. Boots, quiet for his own reasons, takes notes on every little thing that could unlock the mysteries of the Apartment. Shelby would love more than anything for everyone to leave. Together they take an anxiety ridden journey into the human psyche thru bread crumbs, peanuts, and otherworldly delights.","popularity":0.1447,"poster_path":"/zEP8h6UwwdkfSXJBaZl27IT7EGp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":242,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In
