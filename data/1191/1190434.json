If you teach art or film, or if you are a student of any age, your education is incomplete unless you have seen this film. Works of Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, da Vinci, Botticelli, Rapheal and others are used to illustrate the technical and artistic achievements of the Renaissance, but within a very contemporary context of how we see the world in reality or artificial illusion. This is about the discovery of how to make a two dimensional image appear in three dimensions through an understanding of light, shadow, color, and vanishing point perspective.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/dai2THf0FWot5kvM4yJUkP6Tzcs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191819,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Gallery of Art","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masters of Illusion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Burke","original_name":"James Burke","popularity":0.1317,"profile_path":"/w7MUZCOYoAKtU1kqlwac30C5MDY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6528588637806200ac5a89f8","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dai2THf0FWot5kvM4yJUkP6Tzcs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
