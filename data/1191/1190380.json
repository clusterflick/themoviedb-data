The orderly existence of Peter O'Hey and his family is shaken one day by the announcement that a tiger has taken up residence in his bathroom. The state, represented by a civil servant, a tax collector and a protocol chief, as well as the private company, represented by a scientist, a circus director and an old hunter, take a keen interest in this news and try to exploit the unusual situation for their personal interests. They besiege the apartment of Peter O'Hey and finally also claim his life by abusing him as a decoy for the tiger.","popularity":0.1701,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13983,"logo_path":"/wTYO3w8PawspS95VYwsHcajmI0t.png","name":"Südwestfunk","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1964-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Martyrium des Peter OHey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joachim Wichmann","original_name":"Joachim Wichmann","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Peter O'Hey","credit_id":"6773d6ff5b8f422b6012a81e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelika Hurwicz","original_name":"Angelika Hurwicz","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Frau O'Hey","credit_id":"6773d7135b8f422b6012a829","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Rosengarten","original_name":"Thomas Rosengarten","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jas O'Hey","credit_id":"6773d7252efbf3b41d927cce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":9937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Ballhaus","original_name":"Helga Ballhaus","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Die Tochter","credit_id":"6773d748fbe3722a986184a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Meier","original_name":"Heinz Meier","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":"/fgK9LxOAP9zzx9qJnLbMp2bF4bD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Der Beamte","credit_id":"6773d7640f248e850812aab6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Timerding","original_name":"Hans Timerding","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Der Steuereinnehmer","credit_id":"6773d777fbe3722a986184bc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter Meisner","original_name":"Günter Meisner","popularity":0.3596,"profile_path":"/ox9kMd3d7HMEdKI38A9zudZFHKp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Der Wissenschaftler","credit_id":"6773d78ffbe3722a986184c9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Welbat","original_name":"Alexander Welbat","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Der Zirkusdirektor","credit_id":"6773d7a11c1d7e09cf614481","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Rebel","original_name":"Adolf Rebel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Der Chef des Protokolls","credit_id":"6773d7b41c1d7e09cf614488","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1807937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Götz Olaf Rausch","original_name":"Götz Olaf Rausch","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Der alte Jäger","credit_id":"6773d7c54111599e3812aecc","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lilienthal","original_name":"Peter Lilienthal","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/u9BLljfU1E3jFzJu2LQ406vNWOY.jpg","credit_id":"652825f981383100e12e8920","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1804070,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sławomir Mrożek","original_name":"Sławomir Mrożek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kclqOFyaWqTfAM9uLgEz6W0XdbR.jpg","credit_id":"6773d8904111599e3812aeec","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2347316,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hubert von Bechtolsheim","original_name":"Hubert von Bechtolsheim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6773e02c6234c1b46f617297","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3769,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Ballhaus","original_name":"Michael Ballhaus","popularity":0.3246,"profile_path":"/9DHIGsrgeTWA0rch3fFGXTOl1lO.jpg","credit_id":"67db13da08cb5eb727e77eef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0058330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1964-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
