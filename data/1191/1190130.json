Each year, these birds migrate south from North America. Around September they pass the Ozogoche lakes, where large numbers then “commit suicide,”  plunging from great heights into the ice-cold water. A girl lives near the lake. Her uncle lives in the US, and she might be heading there herself. In the meantime, she awaits the arrival of the cuvivís, few of which have  appeared in recent years. The lakes are drying up.","popularity":0.4194,"poster_path":"/yQx7XUhSZdIrmxL3AYAwx6JcSlj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81271,"logo_path":"/gJ4qdlKjwaHUa56aUuJcYQEQGwG.png","name":"Botón Films","origin_country":"EC"},{"id":210780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serendipity Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2023-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Quechua","iso_639_1":"qu","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ozogoche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710042,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pablo Secaira","original_name":"Pablo Secaira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652754480cb33516f5c7c971","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4316544,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mesías Maiguashca","original_name":"Mesías Maiguashca","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652754820cb33516f745e774","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2589870,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Diego Illescas","original_name":"Juan Diego Illescas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527548d1f3e60011c488f35","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirna Everhard","original_name":"Mirna Everhard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527541d1f3e6000e28e43c8","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2500009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Cornejo Pinto","original_name":"Andrés Cornejo Pinto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652753cc1f3e6000e28e438b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Houlberg","original_name":"Joe Houlberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kY1VH1yf1FtQIcT9rI1ERkFW7zh.jpg","credit_id":"652753b3ea84c7014e0350d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Houlberg","original_name":"Joe Houlberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kY1VH1yf1FtQIcT9rI1ERkFW7zh.jpg","credit_id":"652753deea84c7014e0350f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3114951,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ellen De Waele","original_name":"Ellen De Waele","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/1zPYADLctyYDYLtaK2wMB0QJc0X.jpg","credit_id":"652754101f3e6001399caf13","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3158069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oscar X.
