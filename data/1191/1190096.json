Because human beings were not sent to earth but cast out to it. Disappointments are to be expected. In “I Still Talk to You,” Turkan Huseyn illustrates a conversation with her friend. It is about love and the longing to return to the past, about childhood and its no longer existing coordinates in time and space. A melancholy dialogue broken up by brief encounters: stranded looking people who also explain their views of and experiences with love. Meanwhile, the fish in the Caspian Sea are coated in a thin layer of oil that merely needs to be wiped off. It used to be less dirty here, Turkan Huseyn says. When you are a child, everything seems less dirty, her friend replies. A laconic zooming back and forth between inside and outside, in the centre of which a few buckets of blood-red flowers bloom anyway.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gbxXJ6M1dHSAsSHTySoiVS3GbqJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chinar Film Azerbaijan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2023-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Still Talk to You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orkhan Iskandarli","original_name":"Orkhan Iskandarli","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/pMcRmr3KsVAGx25QYUpSA0cQGUA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"652c00460cb33516fd4a101c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3277075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Turkan Huseyn","original_name":"Turkan Huseyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652732b71f3e6000c58744af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4321588,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hafiz Ibrahim","original_name":"Hafiz İbrahim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c00571f3e6000ac4ebfc5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3277075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Turkan Huseyn","original_name":"Turkan Huseyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c006e024ec800c7746ec7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3615412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emil Najafov","original_name":"Emil Najafov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c007aea84c7010c1c329f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1069,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/21fbipGDXLqEhI0hVoDAN0qJh7P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1900}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gbxXJ6M1dHSAsSHTySoiVS3GbqJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DokLeipzig","release_date":"2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
