With just a compass and road map to guide them, they navigated through rough weather, mechanical failures, public scrutiny and rumors of sabotage. Wearing breeches and goggles during the day and ball gowns in the evening, these aviators challenged stereotypes by proving women could be independent, competitive, self-sufficient, intelligent, graceful and above all, really good pilots. Breaking Through The Clouds shows actual footage from the 1929 air race, aerial recreations using planes like the women flew in the derby, interviews with legendary pilots Elinor Smith and Patty Wagstaff as well as family members of the pilots and aviation experts.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/lRlRhX61rtHdJdd1PLL51IVahD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The First Women's National Air Derby","title":"Breaking Through the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4316228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heather Taylor","original_name":"Heather Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6526f4d5cedac400e21315c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4316228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heather Taylor","original_name":"Heather Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6526f4ad81383100c489a67a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1688421","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1624,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lRlRhX61rtHdJdd1PLL51IVahD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1134}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
