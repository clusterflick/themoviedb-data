Caiomhe Butterly is one of a growing number of volunteers who risk their own safety to intervene in the long-running and bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine. Several internationals, including her, have now been injured. Some have died.  In this film, she describes witnessing the aftermath of the attack on Jenin in April 2002. The film follows her work, the main emphasis being “the accompaniment of communities at risk”. Despite being threatened, shot in the leg and deported later that year, she is determined to go back.","popularity":0.2422,"poster_path":"/oWXMElUQnRMYMR6UkZQgqk8aiIe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visit Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caoimhe Butterly","original_name":"Caoimhe Butterly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator / Self","credit_id":"675317e6516edeab29994799","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831997,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Katie Barlow","original_name":"Katie Barlow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65286cc4ae6f0900adcd76ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831997,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Katie Barlow","original_name":"Katie Barlow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675318033a9c6990b1e46dba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caoimhe Butterly","original_name":"Caoimhe Butterly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753181f678b1834d97b7d1a","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102347,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hassan Ramadan","original_name":"Hassan Ramadan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67531935ab37fcd3e88531d7","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caoimhe Butterly","original_name":"Caoimhe Butterly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67531952678b1834d97b7d74","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vXTf2ZeZkNBLq5YZn51XDPVhsTf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oWXMElUQnRMYMR6UkZQgqk8aiIe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":208908,"name":"gaza strip"},{"id":252307,"name":"children on war"},{"id":255640,"name":"intifada"},{"id":267595,"name":"israeli occupation"},{"id":298877,"name":"palestinian resistance"},{"id":338016,"name":"palestinian territories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
