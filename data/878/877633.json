During the day time she looks after her husband, who is sick with Alzheimer disease. The contrast between her professional life, in close proximity to the very rich and their over the top surroundings, and the modest manner in which she lives her life slowly leads Liudmyla to a mental break-down. The only amusement or release that she has - is her platonic attraction towards an angelic and sexy women singer - who herself has no interest towards Liudmyla whatsoever. When Liudmyla can't bare this dull routine any longer, she begins to fantasize that she can run away from her responsibilities toward her husband, to leave him in the \"swarm\" of other \"unwanted people\".","popularity":0.0745,"poster_path":"/6x2C99bm8Lkq3y8buXqFbTlgRSz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Real Pictures","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unwanted People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Nepotribni Lyudy","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2450183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olena Khyzhna","original_name":"Olena Khyzhna","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/naKlntWZSJpYNpGBNehsSVrOqIQ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Liudmyla","credit_id":"664c91d059b31045c654ac71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Gerashchenko","original_name":"Igor Gerashchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dmytro","credit_id":"614dc9c1d55c3d00438e736d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Kononenko","original_name":"Natalie Kononenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Singer","credit_id":"614dc9d6534661002a8965b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3246025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Mamontenko","original_name":"Anastasia Mamontenko","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/7upkxNsMpKiggqx8YDOQOsIz6Ce.jpg","credit_id":"614dc9eb9f51af0068002502","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3246025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Mamontenko","original_name":"Anastasia Mamontenko","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/7upkxNsMpKiggqx8YDOQOsIz6Ce.jpg","credit_id":"614dca419f51af002b59d0b7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246026,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Regina Maryanovska Davidzon","original_name":"Regina Maryanovska Davidzon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614dca55c740d90043ff57e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3246027,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daria Drykina","original_name":"Daria Drykina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614dca67c740d90026fcd388","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3246028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oleksii Hladushevskyi","original_name":"Олексій Гладушевський","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qxSGbU4j56JZ5IOHBGCk2kgAfoE.jpg","credit_id":"614dcb235f4b7300269712b2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246036,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrii Kaplia","original_name":"Andrii Kaplia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614dcd2de1faed0043d46de0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246038,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maxim Denysenko","original_name":"Maxim Denysenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614dcd3ce1faed002d1f71c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15482494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6x2C99bm8Lkq3y8buXqFbTlgRSz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569},{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/rKxaqbtlm2DQ7Z3U3vxBQQeBBnV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"(Kyiv) ","release_date":"2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Unwanted People Trailer","key":"nLndsFdgdYQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-23T18:11:26.000Z","id":"614dc93a326ec1002e65aba5"}]}}}
