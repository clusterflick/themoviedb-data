The king decides the only solution is to raid the treasures of the Knights Templar (amongst others) and concocts various charges of treason, heresy and deviance against the Knights and their Grand Master Jacques de Molay. Having confessed under torture to the crimes of which he is accused, de Molay is condemned to be burned at the stake. With his dying breath he curses the king, the king's advisor (Guillaume de Nogaret), the pope (Pope Clement V) and the thirteen succeeding generations of their families. There follows one of the most dramatic periods in French history, half a century of political intrigue, murder, treason, war and famine, which ultimately culminates in the 100 Years War.","popularity":0.2736,"poster_path":"/pMewMAeo818OaG8o0lRhMS7ZmxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":480,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cursed Monarchy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Moreau","original_name":"Jeanne Moreau","popularity":0.9068,"profile_path":"/lsIlRbcStJev5n1mypIeUUYKWuy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mahaut d'Artois","credit_id":"614f3612c3514c008c951f4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Torreton","original_name":"Philippe Torreton","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/8iPqW6sf8qBU9n5VPHjFb5FSVkU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Robert d'Artois","credit_id":"614f361bfb8346002c421b62","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Rich","original_name":"Claude Rich","popularity":0.3729,"profile_path":"/pFKzxPQsAIbVsAhrDvp974U9Ras.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cardinal Deuze","credit_id":"614f3626124c8d0062428743","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Line Renaud","original_name":"Line Renaud","popularity":0.4098,"profile_path":"/iQhoonlbQCLF9gci8ULFPSPxwkM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marie de Hongrie","credit_id":"614f362e2d8ef3002a99483d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasile Albineț","original_name":"Vasile Albineț","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Count","credit_id":"614f3636fb8346002c421bb6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":231995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serena Autieri","original_name":"Serena Autieri","popularity":0.2089,"profile_path":"/wx17GgF6GnSwa8ZK9tpKtok2uQ4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Clémence de Hongrie","credit_id":"614f363f3975610043341eef","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Badarau","original_name":"Dan Badarau","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/xs5RzLPkC1aqorYhBOIr5r4c2QI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Captain Bersumee","credit_id":"614f3649397561002abe07f1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Bouchitey","original_name":"Patrick Bouchitey","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/x0isqvzrLzHnW9bAR2jMxaq1SVW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Master Evrard","credit_id":"614f3652124c8d008febd50d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josée Dayan","original_name":"Josée Dayan","popularity":0.2267,"profile_path":"/2WWrqt5l3jyCy0k5QaT8eV0DCb5.jpg","credit_id":"614f35fbe8a3e1008adb9bb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0429046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pMewMAeo818OaG8o0lRhMS7ZmxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Paris Film Festival","release_date":"2005-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
