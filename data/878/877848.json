Shot almost entirely in arty and gritty black-and-white, the film has Carlitos, a young Brazilian guy, meeting his older Uruguayan lover Carlos for an extended tryst in a Buenos Aires hotel room. This romance features many tender, playful, and sexy moments, from the opening scene of Carlitos in bed, to a collage of images of the couple at the film’s end. Oliverio and the actors deftly capture the lovers’ palpable sense of desire in this striking low-budget film.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/ydnCIrfODKUNZE2vRnpddPhDqiX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcards Over the Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2251845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Oliverio","original_name":"Pablo Oliverio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614e77eefb8346002c40fa36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ydnCIrfODKUNZE2vRnpddPhDqiX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
