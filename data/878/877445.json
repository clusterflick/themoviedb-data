Once they meet 'Jack,' however, their street walking nights are brought to a most gruesome and unusual end. Though the murderer bears only a passing resemblance to his more infamous London counterpart, the exploits of Jack the Vomiter will certainly be well remembered in the annals of crime history. Jack himself will see to that - as he leaves his unique calling card at the scene of each new slaying.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8uQLcilpvy9AlgSoxuo94SnnrEY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack the Vomiter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1358589","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8uQLcilpvy9AlgSoxuo94SnnrEY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":765}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
