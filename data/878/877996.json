Roasting skewers, hairpins and nails were the tools of self-liberation in the photo series Zerst√∂rung einer Illusion (\"Destruction of an Illusion\") by Karin Mack, which was produced in 1977 with a self-timer and her hand processing work in the darkroom. Forty years after its creation, it is a new perspective that transforms and sets into motion the examination of the self-image and role as a woman into a three-dimensional object. Light and rotation create an illusory horizon of perception inherent in filmmaking and make the living shadows dance in the delirium of the real. (C.
