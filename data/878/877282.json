A school teacher receives a visit from an educational inspector, who is trying to coherently react to the parents’ complaints. It turns out she spends too much time telling children about the horrible events of the 20th century, in particular about the Holocaust — all in contradiction to the logically drawn school curriculum. She is deeply convinced that while one cannot talk too much about the genocide of the European Jews, it is way too easy not to say enough, not to warn and not to explain.","popularity":0.1237,"poster_path":"/56QbRfTfh8QplmBseODyJXSSgPh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129950,"logo_path":"/q99i0HTouIYYnsMbQ9mEMzVBkMn.png","name":"Gogogo Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inspection","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1701554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Janas","original_name":"Florence Janas","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/bVX3qULhckMh8myBMt7BwXjJY20.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Julia Lasserre","credit_id":"61ebf4203faba0006dc29844","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick d'Assumçao","original_name":"Patrick d'Assumçao","popularity":0.2441,"profile_path":"/3CQPNVHil0TO9oobYsAfznAob7r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"L'inspecteur","credit_id":"61ebf431cedac4001caac463","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":7287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Brochard","original_name":"Isabelle Brochard","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"La dame au café","credit_id":"61ebf43e1ad93b00e90dc7e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3392889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Caroubi","original_name":"Antoine Caroubi","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"L'élève","credit_id":"61ebf44c6d4c97006c9cc88d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Bas","original_name":"Frédéric Bas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614c814fc7176d002da1b096","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3244902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Brami","original_name":"Caroline Brami","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614c81471cac8c002a229835","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360734,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stéphane Gessat","original_name":"Stéphane Gessat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353d52ef8e982007c5cd1cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Rit","original_name":"Martin Rit","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353d51c5f4b73007b858656","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470217,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nicolas Sburlati","original_name":"Nicolas Sburlati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353d5259590e300915b76f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3244902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Brami","original_name":"Caroline Brami","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353d50a43250f007ab6143b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Bas","original_name":"Frédéric Bas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353d5015f4b7300835c9826","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372249,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adèle Le Goff","original_name":"Adèle Le Goff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353d5422441820082f2f9d4","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxime Girard","original_name":"Maxime Girard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353d5385f4b7300835c983b","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14791214","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jV8odkNFO12JBt8V3t33B0HvamW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/56QbRfTfh8QplmBseODyJXSSgPh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":772},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2300,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1XRaQFT7FGodhGMhfw3pAlKp0zg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1725}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Trouville Off-Courts Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
