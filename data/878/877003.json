The participants of the campaign protest against river regulation and concrete embankments, i.e. against the destruction of entire ecosystems. They organise happenings on the water, sew and sport bathing costumes with a pro-river message embroidered on them, which enables them to get the media attention. This is how the River Sisters campaign arouses social awareness about such natural treasures as the Vistula, the Nida, the Dunajec or the Tarnawka Rivers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3243809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecylia Malik","original_name":"Cecylia Malik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614b66f12dffd800921cc445","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
