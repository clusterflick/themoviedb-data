The people of this area of Mexico City still live by the train tracks, just like they did in Buñuel's masterpiece. The Forgotten Tree captures fragments of the lives of Juan, Gaby, Noemí, and Ivonne, who attempt to escape the cycle of extreme poverty and violence in which they live. However, the decisions they make only seem to sink them further into the abyss of their grim everyday life and their tragic fate.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El árbol olvidado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1532512","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
