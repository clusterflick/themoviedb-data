Famous for their quiet, beautiful slow songs, and fascinating harmonies, as well as their religious background (core members Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker are Mormons). For this documentary, a film crew followed Alan and Mimi on tour, at home in Duluth, MN, in their church community, and as parents. It's more than an on-the-road or behind-the-scenes video. It shows Sparhawk as the ambivalent main character in an intriguing movie about religion, violence, conscience, and madness. It can also be seen as a touching love story.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":"/4DoBJcun6lfckoI61EkSbpWonOU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Low: You May Need a Murderer","video":false,"vote_average":5.625,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Sparhawk","original_name":"Alan Sparhawk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e4ec3a36847f828923f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1200255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Parker","original_name":"Mimi Parker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e4ec3a36847f8289243","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1028273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kleijwegt","original_name":"David Kleijwegt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e4ec3a36847f8289249","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1252566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":2162,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4DoBJcun6lfckoI61EkSbpWonOU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1601}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
