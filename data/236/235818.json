Tweety seeks shelter from a blizzard and taps on Granny's house door. Sylvester answers and grabs the canary. He tries to hide Tweety from Granny while evading the attacks of Hector, Granny's bed-ridden bulldog, who wants revenge on Sylvester for his broken leg. Tweety keeps escaping Sylvester's clutches, with Hector's help.","popularity":0.7039,"poster_path":"/uVKFXF46tHN33sp8wZVam0R4EUZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
