When a wolf shows up all the other ducks run away but Huey mistakes him for the scout master, and asks for his help. The wolf gives him several tasks to perform, all designed with Huey ending up on the wolf's dinner table, but dumb Huey turns the situations and the wolf is rendered harmless. The scouts make Huey an honorary member, and the battered wolf is used as a patrol flag.","popularity":0.395,"poster_path":"/6OfU8LlSUCAOccMU97z45qBF6J0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scout Fellow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Raymond","original_name":"Sid Raymond","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/nSHGfFHuTDeF8jKz1zZxTuL1ger.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Baby Huey","credit_id":"63011fe597eab40082b1a3c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fox","credit_id":"63011fee1da7a600a4ce0af9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Baby Huey's Mom","credit_id":"6301249033a376007a442c4c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e53c3a36847f828a11b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641bd265a3e4ba00a106e690","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"641bd26b5907de00ff9d1bb9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641bd275f9aa4700e2fa6cd3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423777,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Owen","original_name":"Robert Owen","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641bd28295c0af00c5af242c","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0147379","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":1784,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6OfU8LlSUCAOccMU97z45qBF6J0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1180}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
