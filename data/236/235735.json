His friends from the previous films and the director himself play out a riotous farce about an overgrown baby who steals his fatherâ€™s cigars. Everyone mugs hilariously. The movie could be taken as another example of the Romantic notion of the artist as a monstrous child or misfit, or a parody of the same rather than the personal confessional statement seen so often in these film movements.","popularity":0.4188,"poster_path":"/cPRyxiQxFESoCVpluOD7T6JG6s2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extraordinary Child","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benson","original_name":"Robert Benson","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59de67ef925141252c08dd08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"598d431cc3a36875c00090bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Fair","original_name":"Yvonne Fair","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"598d4307c3a368755900a02d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"598d4313c3a368755900a036","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Newcomb","original_name":"Walter Newcomb","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"598d4301c3a36875c300a081","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e4fc3a36847f828942d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"59de6833925141252c08dd64","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"59de682e925141252c08dd57","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"59de683992514124cd091c80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0350906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l8SBijBRgo2zKkPEUOI5MstWKHU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1374}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJheUwFqyJUJjZTgdmSQDgtgRoA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":928,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cPRyxiQxFESoCVpluOD7T6JG6s2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":618}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1317,"name":"card game"},{"id":169850,"name":"mischievous child"},{"id":198929,"name":"adult as a child"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
