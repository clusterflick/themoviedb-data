Actress and singer Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas plays his love interest. Since the 1960s, Ruscha has received extensive critical acclaim for his paintings, photographs, drawings, and books exploring the commercial vernacular of Los Angeles—its graphic signage, architecture, and even parking lots. In effect, his work subtly comments on America’s cultural and socioeconomic evolution in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Miracle is one of only two films made by the artist in the 1970s.  – Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis by Kelly Shindler, Associate Curator","popularity":0.7229,"poster_path":"/uP7SOrvF1iCl050NcozhKH9qYFf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miracle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Ganzer","original_name":"Jim Ganzer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53d6b84a0e0a260347000078","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Phillips","original_name":"Michelle Phillips","popularity":0.6063,"profile_path":"/2GmDCCUCNoKAceeerVCuGT481Xo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53d6b85a0e0a26033a000077","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Ruscha","original_name":"Edward Ruscha","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/zXwMj7VLgAUsb3LTGPUDwFGmkWP.jpg","credit_id":"53d6b8250e0a260344000077","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0290769","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uP7SOrvF1iCl050NcozhKH9qYFf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":387,"name":"california"},{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":2131,"name":"visual arts"},{"id":8241,"name":"mustang"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":193156,"name":"pop art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
