As usual, Bluto has a million ways to cheat, and Popeye overcomes all of them to win. Some of the bits: Popeye's suit is connected to a fish hook; the fish unravels it and Popeye knits it back together. Bluto is on a raft and blows sneezing powder at Popeye. Bluto attaches a magnet to Popeye which attracts a mine (which ends up blowing Popeye much closer to the line). Bluto dumps a load of cement on Popeye.","popularity":0.5517,"poster_path":"/t6BlDGeXRjeLkzJrbasDCGuKItj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swimmer Take All","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63cd6c0f336e010084aa6840","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63cd6c1d336e0100c8f34107","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"640be321b4224200b9715854","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e51c3a36847f8289d79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458337,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"John Gentilella","original_name":"John Gentilella","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640be3cd323eba00ef60e10b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"640be384323eba00c5e9c02c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315013,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Thomas Johnson","original_name":"Thomas Johnson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640be3b4439be1007a8a7627","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640be37d1ac29200f6305f9c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123500,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Little","original_name":"Robert Little","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640be3a0a6c10400c0c38016","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640be38d323eba007cb65c3f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0152768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t6BlDGeXRjeLkzJrbasDCGuKItj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uVY0jMBkDxJkq9oEGU4SUwmYdNK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
