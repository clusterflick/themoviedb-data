Asayo Murakami, 103 years old, recalls life in Japan, her arrival in Canada as a \"picture bride,\" her determination to marry a man of her choice, the bombing of Hiroshima and the forced relocation of her family during WWII. Beautifully rendered dramatic sequences are merged with an exquisite collection of memories, feelings, images and voices. Culminating in an emotional reunion with a long-lost daughter, this film is a personal reflection of Japanese-Canadian history and a testament to one woman's endurance and spirit.","popularity":0.1008,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obâchan's Garden","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asayo Murakami","original_name":"Asayo Murakami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a36847f8287f5b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69366,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirk Tougas","original_name":"Kirk Tougas","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a36847f8287f4b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1143984,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Vivian Nishi","original_name":"Vivian Nishi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a36847f8287f57","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Ohama","original_name":"Linda Ohama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a36847f8287f45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029848,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Selwyn Jacob","original_name":"Selwyn Jacob","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a36847f8287f51","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0294802","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
