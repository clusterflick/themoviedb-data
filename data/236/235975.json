Cros didn't come any fresher than Buzzy, and when Katnip spies him ice-skating, he decides to eat him. But Buzzy has no intentions of becoming cat food and he tells the cat he has an ever better cure for colds. Buzzy brews up a concoction of pepper, tabasco sauce and mustard, which turn the cat into a fireworks display, and a blazing sun-lamp sets him on fire. The burning cat rushes out into the snow, which melts...and then freezes over him. Buzzy resumes his ice skating.","popularity":0.4514,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cat-Choo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Raymond","original_name":"Sid Raymond","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/nSHGfFHuTDeF8jKz1zZxTuL1ger.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Katnip (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"67467b42d73a486cbd332ca4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Buzzy (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"67467b4d301fb4f6b617900f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e52c3a36847f828a0df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64224a82c7a7e00084a00414","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940386,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom Ford","original_name":"Tom Ford","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64224a952dc9dc00fd1c3fd4","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"64224a896a3448007bb672c3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116338,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dave Tendlar","original_name":"Dave Tendlar","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64224aae8d22fc00cc0fc15b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208544,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Martin Taras","original_name":"Martin Taras","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64224ab68d22fc01128b23b5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64224aa1534661007a79c2a1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150070","wikidata_id":"Q111018090","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
