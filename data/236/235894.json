Katnip cats a worm-baited hook into the fishbowl, but Finny puts on a napkin and eats the bait with a knife-and-fork. The cat-vs.-fish chase continues until Finny ends up in a bottle of wine, and Katnip quickly drinks the contents of the bottle, including little Finny. Katnip burps up Finny, and both the cat and fish end up as intoxicated buddies.","popularity":0.214,"poster_path":"/6nhFBfUui2xIeX88D6HrrbbzbQ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feast and Furious","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e51c3a36847f8289d03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Larz Bourne","original_name":"Larz Bourne","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64230e2f8d22fc0084046073","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64230e352dc9dc007c07971f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599589,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gordon Whittier","original_name":"Gordon Whittier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64230e5323be4600a1241f33","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336208,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Myron Waldman","original_name":"Myron Waldman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64230e4c6a34480112babc23","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423777,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Owen","original_name":"Robert Owen","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64230e418d22fc008404607e","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150525","wikidata_id":"Q116691634","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6nhFBfUui2xIeX88D6HrrbbzbQ0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
