Mountain guide Bluto spots them through binoculars, and goes crazy over Olive. He immediately intercepts them and tries to convince them they need a professional guide. Popeye resists, so Bluto uses a number of tricks: cutting the rope, burning a bridge they are crossing, using a magnet to break Popeye's climbing pick. Olive finally has had enough, and goes off with Bluto, who promptly gets her alone in a dark cave. Her screams bring Popeye, whose battle with Bluto carves a Mount Rushmore replica in a mountain-top. Bluto knocks Popeye into a snowbank, where a Saint Bernard dog revives him with spinach (after consulting a handy Popeye comic book). Popeye bashes Bluto into a mountain, forming a Paramount logo.","popularity":0.3076,"poster_path":"/bSM5OzB52A1EdapoYXB4UayEyxJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpine for You","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63ccfedfe24b9300cdf93eeb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63ccfef1cee4810084d45f41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63ccfefdcee481008efed654","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e53c3a36847f828a1ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbaa727646fd00867cf1ea","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"63fbaa7957176f009db3e828","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271320,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Germanetti","original_name":"George Germanetti","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbaa8c7646fd008a784662","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Muffati","original_name":"Steve Muffati","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbaa847646fd00822306ca","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbaa6a96e30b009fca364e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579609,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Connavale","original_name":"Robert Connavale","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbaa9657176f0081d6637e","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0149635","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8d1SKfITpAa83HTVVF4SackbOUy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bSM5OzB52A1EdapoYXB4UayEyxJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2UDy3RhPW2ri9gJm5XtzrLls9FE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
