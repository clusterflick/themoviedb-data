There, they see a house made of gingerbread, candies and cakes. They break off pieces of the house and begin to eat it. Then they meet the house's owner, an evil old witch who is riding a vacuum cleaner. She captures the two kids and prepares to cook them. The witch sends her bad cats after Mighty Mouse when he flies to the rescue. He takes care of them and then takes on the witch as she transforms into a giant buzzard! Mighty Mouse knocks the witch into her own evil cauldron, kicking her in the behind! The evil sorceress comes out shrunken to one-fourth her size, and our hero returns Hansel and Gretel to their parents. Mighty Mouse gives Hansel and Gretel's father a magic axe which cuts down all of his trees. The magic device helps to end the family's financial woes","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":"/o3QcV5Dp6pSo9LLCFhed1TGkVoN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hansel and Gretel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connie Rasinski","original_name":"Connie Rasinski","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e51c3a36847f8289d5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150821","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o3QcV5Dp6pSo9LLCFhed1TGkVoN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
