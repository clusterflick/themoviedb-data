But Popeye can't bring himself to do the deed, so he tells them a story about the time he was a pilgrim and a turkey saved his life. Popeye is hunting the turkey, which keeps outsmarting him; he finally corners the bird, which gives him a sob story about being too scrawny to eat. Popeye gives him some spinach, but before the bird can eat it, Popeye is captured by Indians. They tie him to a stake. The turkey, watching, remembers the spinach, which turns the turkey into an eagle. He swoops down, carries off the first batch of Indians and throws them into a mountain; he turns another batch into a totem pole. Popeye finishes his story and sees the boys missing; dinner time! They prepare to serve the turkey his big plate of spinach.","popularity":0.2324,"poster_path":"/6m44oF2FtFRHWxfZdDriCiFhtBD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilgrim Popeye","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Popeye / Nephews / Turkey (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"58b5cdb7c3a368530c000281","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e52c3a36847f828a0b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"640cf7701ac292007c34db32","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cf7692a09bc00e84479a9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148158,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Al Eugster","original_name":"Al Eugster","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cf755a894d600b81d956f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599568,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anton Loeb","original_name":"Anton Loeb","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cf74ae18e3f07d053d67b","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271320,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Germanetti","original_name":"George Germanetti","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cf75d1ac2920081d0ea9a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cf740e18e3f084039ea41","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9iPoeNtCBrU8Rl84urD9V2tQBz1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":641},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":896,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6m44oF2FtFRHWxfZdDriCiFhtBD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":597},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ttki34riHPwK4oD4XdwV9pmlRQ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
