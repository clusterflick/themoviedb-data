Action is exaggerated and time seems to blur, as the lovers' tale unfolds poetically into a modern interpretation of the Persephone myth. Shot entirely on Super-8 - the movie traces the poem, line by line, throughout the city of Seattle in sequences of time-lapse photography blended with live-action that collapse and rearrange time and events into memories. Shot as a silent film, \"Last of Our Kind\" features an original soundtrack created by Robin Guthrie interwoven with a voiceover recitation of Rick Linville's poem.","popularity":0.0769,"poster_path":"/xo7o1E9qZawGPbS4SOSYho56qxy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emerald Reels","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last of Our Kind","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Jones","original_name":"Emma Jones","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5e161dfb1f748b00168460c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Plusquellec","original_name":"Scott Plusquellec","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Narrator","credit_id":"5e161e150cb3350017034d40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Kuma","original_name":"William Kuma","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator's Voice (voice)","credit_id":"5e161e32344a8e001302d3a0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reed O'Beirne","original_name":"Reed O'Beirne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e161d8f1d01910017eff727","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504293,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rick Linville","original_name":"Rick Linville","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e161dab11386c0011c7b2a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":68440,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robin Guthrie","original_name":"Robin Guthrie","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e161dce1d01910017eff7c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504306,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eric Rosen","original_name":"Eric Rosen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1620570cb3350015034c04","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504307,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ted Grudowski","original_name":"Ted Grudowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e16207e66565a00160fd064","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504308,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maque Davis","original_name":"Maque Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1620ae11386c0015c7beb3","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2282845","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"lastofourkindmovie","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1437,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xo7o1E9qZawGPbS4SOSYho56qxy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"United States Super 8 Film + Digital Video Festival","release_date":"2013-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Last of Our Kind (2012)","key":"226690176","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-24T05:26:41.000Z","id":"5e1621c10cd32a0014a882e5"}]}}}
