He is made captain of the U.S. army when he saves a detachment of cavalry from a group of renegade Indians, and further removes himself from his race when he develops a relationship with Miriam, the daughter of the Fort Remmington commandant. Lieutenant Parkman (Walker) gets into a fight with Cardelanche when Parkman is demoted, while General Custer's troops are slaughtered by Cardelanche's people. Cardelanche decides that his true allegiance is to his own race, and gives up Miriam to return to them.","popularity":0.4338,"poster_path":"/Ms7vXCX5iz2juinStiN8KNEdud.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank J.
