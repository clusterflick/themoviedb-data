With his sleazy, below-the-belt campaign tactics, he's hell-bent on destroying his opponents reputations and getting himself and his wife to the top of the heap in Washington D.C. In \"SCHOOL, GIRLS, & YOU,\" it's the 1950's -- and strait-laced Everdale University is about to go \"coed\". In order to prepare it's student body for the onslaught of \"females\" on campus, they present this hard-hitting educational film. Wally Bile is the \"wrong-way\" role model with Science Professor, Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom explains the vital \"do's and don'ts\" on dating women, and the all-important \"warning signs\" and \"danger signals\" to look out for when close-encountering the opposite sex.","popularity":1.065,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Likely Stories Vol. 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Carey","original_name":"Timothy Carey","popularity":0.4181,"profile_path":"/6ml0D7Etl20EB7bHmEsSuyamzec.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e15f033d8af670014c4b3c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny DeVito","original_name":"Danny DeVito","popularity":2.3266,"profile_path":"/6kO4IN7ndoIGw2JhyhAQN3SFmdx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e15f038d399e60014fdc895","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerrit Graham","original_name":"Gerrit Graham","popularity":0.6592,"profile_path":"/itz1a5P3RxCt8BySFbMxKCQ5yeZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e15f03dd399e60014fdc89c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Kimmel","original_name":"Bruce Kimmel","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/lPmW8xzy8vcO9q1HOeSqVbE9acn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e15f042d399e60016fdb3af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Macnee","original_name":"Patrick Macnee","popularity":0.8061,"profile_path":"/i7olaWWHDaOIou49JMSkykl8nWt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e15f049d399e60016fdb3b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Reubens","original_name":"Paul Reubens","popularity":1.5729,"profile_path":"/9xGL3pGNAiZDtzKTVDQY90Mkyqs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e15f050d8af670014c4b3ff","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
