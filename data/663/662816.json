In the meantime we are shown the gathering of seafood, the coming and going of people at the port and the ruins of ancient Greek settlements: Selinunte, Girgenti. The dominant colours in the film are the blue of the sea, the yellow of the sun and a beautiful red toning to render the majesty of the ruins standing out against the sky. The video is a copy from the film print held by the National Cinema Museum.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/A62wb9lnjOVEV5OZr5z8Qih8mPC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiziano Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through Sicily","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piero Marelli","original_name":"Piero Marelli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e191ba3a0be280015ffa990","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30872330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1528,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/A62wb9lnjOVEV5OZr5z8Qih8mPC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1019},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lSOfI0DOey2TgKFvRQZvwkCvphn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Attraverso la Sicilia (Tiziano Film, Anni Dieci)","key":"85354300","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-01-29T15:45:04.000Z","id":"5e19200ea0be280015ffbeb8"}]}}}
