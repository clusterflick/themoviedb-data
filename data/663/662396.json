The movie ends with the triumph of the humane side.","popularity":0.0862,"poster_path":"/vat7DoFBUm3iGBJGzXKPwnO20RM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Labia International","origin_country":"XK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"}],"release_date":"2012-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Code of Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bubulina Lajçi","original_name":"Bubulina Lajçi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"5e17647e2fe2fa0012c64a3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Çun Lajçi","original_name":"Çun Lajçi","popularity":0.2095,"profile_path":"/vOkZAeJqJPs8mJaYKf4uxZTHwSN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Crni","credit_id":"5e1764861d01910017f24b80","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xhevat Qorraj","original_name":"Xhevat Qorraj","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lani","credit_id":"5e17648fa9117f0014c8f7e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilir Tafa","original_name":"Ilir Tafa","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Cile","credit_id":"5e176496c2f44b0017bf3157","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mentor Zymberaj","original_name":"Mentor Zymberaj","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Žuti","credit_id":"5e1764a40cb335001505d10e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekrem Kryeziu","original_name":"Ekrem Kryeziu","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e17645e2fe2fa0017c650cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekrem Kryeziu","original_name":"Ekrem Kryeziu","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e176464c2f44b0014bf185a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2322395","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vat7DoFBUm3iGBJGzXKPwnO20RM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
