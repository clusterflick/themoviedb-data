Letts injected Afro-Caribbean music into the early punk scene and shot over 300 music videos including for Public Image Ltd. and Bob Marley, but also for teen sensations Musical Youth's reggae smash 'Pass The Dutchie'. Besides his enduring relationship with The Clash, the constant factor in Letts' eventful career as a DJ, manager, film director, musician and radio maker is that, from the 1970s on, he continued to draw attention to cultural issues, as he does today with his radio programme for BBC 6, Culture Clash Radio.","popularity":0.512,"poster_path":"/rBVJLL8hbwxvhIDSWXwGXhoEz4y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of Don Letts, the legendary rebel of British counterculture.","title":"Rebel Dread","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Letts","original_name":"Don Letts","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/dMvtHGyOd3erjjn6xE3seLpTZYW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e50569c9b861600116da29f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jones","original_name":"Mick Jones","popularity":0.1135,"profile_path":"/qLP0NDBt5ELpRg72Ax3OJkOfieO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e5056bc35811d0017541cce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lydon","original_name":"John Lydon","popularity":0.3712,"profile_path":"/iYVqtqbSngil3AoaqEYlNp68fbg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e5056e0eb09320016416441","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grant Marshall","original_name":"Grant Marshall","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a2c20e33f830043b9bbad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3426374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jazzie B","original_name":"Jazzie B","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a2c80e33f83001b1151dc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3426375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Coy","original_name":"Desmond Coy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a2cc526dac100e531d705","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannette Lee","original_name":"Jeannette Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a2cdefab3fa00e7d56055","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137216,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Salewicz","original_name":"Chris Salewicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a2e07931ea10042e5eb8e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1345962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andi Oliver","original_name":"Andi Oliver","popularity":0.2559,"profile_path":"/1QMchTQrABsiKrIlZEnLKxFnbuK.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a2e19a313b8001bb33887","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Bovell","original_name":"Dennis Bovell","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a2e6d945d3600b3838198","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1583987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Jay","original_name":"Norman Jay","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620a48df26dac100e531e607","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Simonon","original_name":"Paul Simonon","popularity":0.2175,"profile_path":"/jmxCi7tPzrVosDpJPIXIm2hUSWi.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f4382c880c92007af052d9","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William E.
