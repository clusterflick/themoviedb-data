Although his father discovers this horrible coincidence when he meets his wife after the war, he keeps this realization secret. Eventually his father has a breakdown, confessing his tragic story, forcing Ben to be torn between his love of his parents and internal feelings of betrayal by his own fervent efforts to assimilate.","popularity":0.1139,"poster_path":"/A4tqM50Z7jeqlfUw5NfCzKhyUy8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Divine Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roddy Bogawa","original_name":"Roddy Bogawa","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e951005db72c00019acb125","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0348070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e8JWNFYE6BOr03lEckMIE3U1qgc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A4tqM50Z7jeqlfUw5NfCzKhyUy8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
