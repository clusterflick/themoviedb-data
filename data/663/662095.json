He grew up in New York City, a place where either you learn fast, or lose everything. Estranged from his mother, and never knowing his dead father, Donny sets out to collect on debts owed, and is dragged deep into a seductive ambush that turns his world upside down. Donny reaches out for help from a \"connected\" Mulberry Street caf√© owner, Gigetto, who has more problems than just the Russian mob. Insidious is a compelling and riveting story of desperation and betrayal, as Donny faces a fight for truth, love, and life itself. Insidious has a strong ensemble of New York City acting talent, and their multiple adult story lines are centered in their emotional and financial relationships.","popularity":0.3429,"poster_path":"/tPdPr7VWTmXaXMeADLrxiCIL0ha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insidious","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Claymore","original_name":"Peter Claymore","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Doc","credit_id":"5e160d71d399e60016fdeca8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenda Cooney","original_name":"Brenda Cooney","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/jTIGG4AxVozUzN4jg2HHIMEDXa9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Arin","credit_id":"5e160d855907de0017e5b023","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Corry","original_name":"Megan Corry","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Naomi","credit_id":"5e160d985907de0017e5b0a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5113257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lepre","original_name":"Michael Lepre","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/p2RPPprusPYCQfVV82dlsZXPe9k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Scanlon","credit_id":"678cafaa880f6bd3846df633","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1235718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Schram","original_name":"Jerry Schram","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e160d595907de0017e5afe3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1225292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.652,"height":1227,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/tPdPr7VWTmXaXMeADLrxiCIL0ha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
