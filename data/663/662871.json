The  grandfather  Andris  is  sceptic  over  the  lofty  quest,  initiated  by  his  grand-son, as it’s not known what awaits them at their destination. Andris thinks they won’t find anything and will come back to Latvia without ever learning what happened to his father. However  ever-optimistic  Kārlis  wants  to  use  the  journey  not  only  to  find  answers  about  the past but also become closer to his grandfather who raised him. They both lost their parents as children.","popularity":0.3764,"poster_path":"/bgP4RV56QHwXQ01oq2OtLKjAosw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woodpecker Pictures","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":118793,"logo_path":"/AckxUfY5wGZjKNnbiWDKubqxX8t.png","name":"Latvijas Televizija","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandfather's Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andris Fridrihsons","original_name":"Andris Fridrihsons","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"5e199a256f43ec0013628839","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","original_name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/cf6jh5Y3bRE5afkIx0GpMXlEWSj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"5e199a356f43ec001662876f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","original_name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e199aa6a0be280018009969","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2271604,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mārtiņš Jurēvics","original_name":"Mārtiņš Jurēvics","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e199a97b3f6f50012d4b466","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toms Krauklis","original_name":"Toms Krauklis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e199ab3a0be28001500d7a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","original_name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/cf6jh5Y3bRE5afkIx0GpMXlEWSj.jpg","credit_id":"5e199a7e6f43ec0016628815","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506658,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Laura Cīrule","original_name":"Laura Cīrule","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e199ac6a0be2800180099a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2019284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matīss Gricmanis","original_name":"Matīss Gricmanis","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe1d8388e2ba6003e9bae3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":908,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hMKldyLTiA8aeiR34jBIxayqd5u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1616}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bgP4RV56QHwXQ01oq2OtLKjAosw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":909,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tXQkgwCtP4ZARNPZpSjBOsRnt0w.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":597}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":240275,"name":"loss of family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
