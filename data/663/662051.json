Ismaïl Bahri's poetic film plays with this paradox. We see two hands holding a photograph which is illuminated by strong light from two sides, blinding us to its contents.

A synaesthetic gesture, where seeing is enabled by touch.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/hauVNRlVktQ4c5P6huP8pE9rMXN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apparition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ismaïl Bahri","original_name":"Ismaïl Bahri","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cJcWDXgtIONLfVRsI40b3Qayq5S.jpg","credit_id":"5e15e94c5907de0012e596b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ismaïl Bahri","original_name":"Ismaïl Bahri","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cJcWDXgtIONLfVRsI40b3Qayq5S.jpg","credit_id":"5f7ec443d11e0e0035be78ef","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12758230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hauVNRlVktQ4c5P6huP8pE9rMXN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2020-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IndieLisboa","release_date":"2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
