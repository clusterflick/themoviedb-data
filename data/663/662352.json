Arthur Indenbaum was the son of an American diamond dealer who had come to Antwerp in the late 1960s to be trained in his father’s business. Soon, however, Arthur found his way into the lively art and music scene of Antwerp of the period where he liked to get high, hang out with friends and play music with his band ‘Live’. At the time Gallery Vacuum was an art space run by artists and musicians Luc Deleu, Filip Francis and George Smits, who were an integral part of Antwerp’s alternative scene. On 6 May 1970 Arthur, with his extraordinarily big physical build and fuzzy hair, was exhibited as a live sculpture in Gallery Vacuum during a one-night show in which Ludo Mich took part as well.","popularity":0.0691,"poster_path":"/pEJsjXtsr9h5Sbz35GWyK1AH8Ju.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arthur Is Fantastic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Indenbaum","original_name":"Arthur Indenbaum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e17427dc2f44b0012bef5da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1791809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ludo Mich","original_name":"Ludo Mich","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e1b59543520e8001335dea0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347415,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jules Goris","original_name":"Jules Goris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e17425ccf4b8b001181cf61","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robbe De Hert","original_name":"Robbe De Hert","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/5xlejxhguHNKwRSP3GtZ1xp0WRH.jpg","credit_id":"5e1742481d01910015f2296a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1791809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ludo Mich","original_name":"Ludo Mich","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e174231cf4b8b001181cf1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0268947","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pEJsjXtsr9h5Sbz35GWyK1AH8Ju.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
