The defeated Napoleonic army is retreating. Three Russian soldiers settled in a snowy forest near a fire: a young (Zaletayev), an elderly and a middle-aged one. Zaletayev fantasizes — as if he had captured Napoleon. The soldiers laugh good-naturedly at him. After dinner, they fall asleep...\r Two Frenchmen go to the clearing — an officer and a soldier. Russian soldiers wake up and, seeing that the officer is barely standing on his feet from cold and hunger, take him to the colonel. The French soldier sits down to the fire. The Russians give him porridge and vodka. The soldier, encouraged, sings a french song. Zaletayev echoes him. A tired Frenchman falls asleep on Zaletayev’s shoulder. The soldiers carefully shelter him. “Also people,” an elderly soldier says with a sigh.","popularity":0.4294,"poster_path":"/xJuAuNIkzj2TXQ7ERSzUIqvDfLN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Also People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lev Durov","original_name":"Лев Дуров","popularity":0.196,"profile_path":"/c22qbwRzYQq02Jov3EgnXvxd8Ex.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Zaletayev","credit_id":"5e1728c3c2f44b0017bedc5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manos Zacharias","original_name":"Manos Zacharias","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/3U9uzPWXX3FpMi64Ree69boiacI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"French Army Officer","credit_id":"5e1728e111386c0013c9ad6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vsevolod Sanayev","original_name":"Всеволод Санаев","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/jf3rHGpMf2M3MqUDNFAWONZvlak.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Old Soldier","credit_id":"5e1727df1d01910015f20fee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevgeni Kudryashov","original_name":"Евгений Кудряшёв","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/5b4NjZkarC7sBcKer2OEpmPqceG.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Middle-aged soldier","credit_id":"6542ac111365450120edef91","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ferapontov","original_name":"Владимир Ферапонтов","popularity":0.6668,"profile_path":"/ldPLjMw1yHeHhIytuWuzzhZxd4X.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"French Soldier","credit_id":"5e1728f5c2f44b0017bedcd5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgi Millyar","original_name":"Георгий Милляр","popularity":0.3725,"profile_path":"/Akte38wV0IIOk3PJRlTPrdaVfq2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"French Soldier","credit_id":"5e172907c2f44b0012bee2c2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646199,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolay Olonovskiy","original_name":"Николай Олоновский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rEUhj5yKTARulkdLUtga9j7u4HG.jpg","credit_id":"6542939c13654500e15e6122","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgiy Daneliya","original_name":"Георгий Данелия","popularity":0.3454,"profile_path":"/xw1nTEaWzd0QEQGRFGAU0s9xwd9.jpg","credit_id":"5e1725a6c2f44b0017bed86f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leo Tolstoy","original_name":"Лев Толстой","popularity":0.4416,"profile_path":"/5LWREWaROuw0VG9xDgq11P4h2zC.jpg","credit_id":"5e1725f311386c0011c9ce01","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2049241,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Pyotr Veremenko","original_name":"Пётр Веременко","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1f02bf9f1be70018864388","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgiy Daneliya","original_name":"Георгий Данелия","popularity":0.3454,"profile_path":"/xw1nTEaWzd0QEQGRFGAU0s9xwd9.jpg","credit_id":"5e1f1cdae55937001724e4dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13705,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Inna Zelentsova","original_name":"Inna Zelentsova","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1f027ae559370015245a44","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0170703","wikidata_id":"Q4459376","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/xJuAuNIkzj2TXQ7ERSzUIqvDfLN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/gLtMwRJoeuOr30lw4UD5XZR6HDq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":11709,"name":"russian soldier"},{"id":33384,"name":"napoleonic wars"},{"id":166489,"name":"war of 1812"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
