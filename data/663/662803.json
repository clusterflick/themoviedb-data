He does this in voice-over, accompanied by images from Canada's national archives. The painstakingly selected and fluidly edited black-and-white clips build up, like the perfectly fitting pieces of a puzzle; an impression of his mother as he had imagined her. How she grew up, worked, loved and left him.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/yiUIkV01pMPMoNWPfKtAwQedayq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29201,"logo_path":"/93Cu4sHMvJLgCwk9wpQY5xrb3XA.png","name":"Les Films de L'Autre","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Woman, My Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Demers","original_name":"Claude Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1907793679a1001393e2a0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Demers","original_name":"Claude Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1905153679a1001593d5e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Demers","original_name":"Claude Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1905213679a1001593d5ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740987,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Natalie Lamoureux","original_name":"Natalie Lamoureux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e19053ab3f6f50016d3739c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1372758,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stéphanie Weber Biron","original_name":"Stéphanie Weber Biron","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/5uatDxTiqBwB2kEdrL3r5vnnitO.jpg","credit_id":"5e1905ebb3f6f50014d3844e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Tétreault","original_name":"Olivier Tétreault","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e19061f3679a1001593d950","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Demers","original_name":"Claude Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1906a7a0be280013ff5194","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11601734","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yiUIkV01pMPMoNWPfKtAwQedayq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":692}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"festival (Rencontres internationales du documentaire de Montréal)","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
