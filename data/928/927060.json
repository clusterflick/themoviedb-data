Delve into Raphael’s uncanny ability to capture celestial beauty, and to focus his gaze beyond the physicality and into the psychology of his subjects (some real, some imaginary) so that their personalities explosively emerge from his canvas.  With fascinating contributions from internationally renowned experts, this documentary will uncover the most significant people and places and inspirations in the life and times of Raphael – a Renaissance leader and one of the most spectacular painters in history.","popularity":0.4838,"poster_path":"/6hWclr8En82qyWurLR3Vf5lsoqG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sky Italia","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raphael: The Young Prodigy","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Golino","original_name":"Valeria Golino","popularity":2.2662,"profile_path":"/bLw0lNPEhICtbTLtnTswamefN7C.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61f182496af9dd001bb2d102","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1469274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Massimo Ferrari","original_name":"Massimo Ferrari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9s2V1lICsd14OjVRNwVtYQO9FhJ.jpg","credit_id":"61f182ea66565a009ed6e355","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14431336","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6C88jilUcIqGnkvKEjzZmCCSgBn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/86nLTCqfL6BfvhJfbGEEpnt2h8i.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.077,"height":260,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8AGEKQWh5J5eMNfXZx3vTjHDWAi.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6hWclr8En82qyWurLR3Vf5lsoqG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1428,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vrRccH1PGQ6Kczm99GA2X0A84lF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":952},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ffErKC1BTz14BgkEVyt1XytiKHq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":856,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/eappAmg5nT1FWP6gG0i53S6Kc9a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":171453,"name":"art history"},{"id":207257,"name":"renaissance painting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
