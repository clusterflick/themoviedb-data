Antebellum Gallery existed from 2005~ 2017 in the heart of historic Hollywood on Las Palmas Avenue. Owner & curator Rick Castro presented fetish as art on a monthly basis for a group of like-minded enthusiasts who he lovingly referred to as “Antebellians.”  During Antebellum’s reign, Rick saw the times as a 21st century pre-war era, a time of cultural strife between social freedoms and the religious right culminating in a bad reality TV millionaire becoming dictator. The Antebellum era, like the Weimar era are historic short bursts of creative experimentation and freedoms existing under a looming dark cloud of things to come.","popularity":0.339,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antebellum","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388631,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rick Castro","original_name":"Rick Castro","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e33ac87304b5006c12cb7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
