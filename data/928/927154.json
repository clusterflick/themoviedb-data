Dated 1995 but likely spanning a few years, this series contains footage shot while still a student at SVA, images captured on the streets, and at home featuring friends and strangers in the flow of life. Sogo rarely screened his intricately detailed, exquisitely photographed diaries in public, but when he did they left a lasting impression on all those who saw them. Dizzying in their breakneck speed, these works demonstrate Sogo’s incredible eye and preternatural ability to compose in-camera.
