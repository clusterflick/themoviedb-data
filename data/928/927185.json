The crossbars are almost constantly in motion, sometimes as a single bar, sometimes as a group of several, and finally as a single bar. The moving crosses resemble film strips at times, but then they turn in a circle or shift and reveal the outside world: trees, bushes, or the sky. The images move faster and more frantically, superimposing on top of each other until they are interrupted at the end by individual freeze frames.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yOsol0HjCCtfpFQWr0nYqs98p3D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XVI/84 Fenster III","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"61e213f190b87e006d0d86b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yOsol0HjCCtfpFQWr0nYqs98p3D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
