After what seems to be a connection with a Mexican Bakery worker turns into a misunderstanding, Shin experiences a side of Los Angeles invisible to his social circle of Japanese expats. Subdued and restrained, the film offers an unsentimental and personal portrait of living in between time zones and cultures in a city indicative of a world growing smaller.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/qJ6UJL5hweSlVmwiUb2GYXazhx4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6477,"logo_path":"/tn6i5FOfcfCrYR3zviZVvYdolwu.png","name":"Opus Film","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2007-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Loneliness of the Short-Order Cook","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Okuda","original_name":"Shin Okuda","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shin","credit_id":"61e573b107a808006780e06c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norberto Briceno","original_name":"Norberto Briceno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Norberto","credit_id":"61e5738e904f6d001cf958c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Azeoka","original_name":"Bryan Azeoka","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tadashi","credit_id":"61e5737b7d2bc1006a81e06e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Okuda","original_name":"Shin Okuda","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e573e52d9375008a283a72","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2255222,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcel Sawicki","original_name":"Marcel Sawicki","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e573f0ca0e17004254ac68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2255222,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcel Sawicki","original_name":"Marcel Sawicki","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e57355c613ce0067e0ab03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104365,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Łukasz Dzięcioł","original_name":"Łukasz Dzięcioł","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":"/l1uYC5F8vMWxosKoavIySodfEPw.jpg","credit_id":"671256bb8e844657b7fb1e66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1230148","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJ6UJL5hweSlVmwiUb2GYXazhx4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
