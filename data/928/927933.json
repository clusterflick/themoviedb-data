Half enunciated words and phrases from Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The Yellow Wallpaper – a cautionary tale on the perils and extravagances of seeing and being seen – qualify extracts from the filmmaker’s own correspondence on film and photography with American artist Elaine Smollin that forms the auditory foreground to this film.
