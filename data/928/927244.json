Orange groves framed by palm trees and snow capped mountains drew legions of migrants, rich and poor, from smokestack cities of the east and Midwest from the late 1800s through the 1950s. Orange Sunrise tells the history of an industry and a way of life.\r ---\r A year in the making, Orange Sunrise explains how citrus once blanketed Southern California and defined the California Dream for the rest of America and beyond. The one-hour documentary by award-winning Inland Empire filmmaker Peter Coonradt also explores efforts to preserve local citrus farming in the face of exploding development and the pressures of the global economy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":167943,"logo_path":null,"name":"Riverside County Community Health Agency","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A juicy story that has a peel!","title":"Orange Sunrise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Brown","original_name":"Jim Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"61e261a4d8e225001a731c35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383393,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Harrington","original_name":"Susan Harrington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e260d1cb30840042a471c5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sherli Leonard","original_name":"Sherli Leonard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e260e1e0ec51001c090d8e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383395,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Knight","original_name":"Bob Knight","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e260f55f622b0097bdb194","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383397,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Campbell","original_name":"James Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e2613455c1f400674794a2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meta Berkabile","original_name":"Meta Berkabile","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e2614c55c1f400674794be","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Coonradt","original_name":"Peter Coonradt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rZC9bpFeMCCiE32nwjFxJqJViLa.jpg","credit_id":"61e2615f90b87e00a9208ddf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Coonradt","original_name":"Peter Coonradt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rZC9bpFeMCCiE32nwjFxJqJViLa.jpg","credit_id":"61e2616c12425c004492d1b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Coonradt","original_name":"Peter Coonradt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rZC9bpFeMCCiE32nwjFxJqJViLa.jpg","credit_id":"61e2617812425c00990950a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Orange Sunrise","key":"332353813","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-04-25T01:00:38.000Z","id":"61e262cf12425c00990952d2"}]}}}
