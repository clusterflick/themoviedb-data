The sound of the wooden xylophone connects the present-day life on the Ecuadorian Pacific coast with its African roots. Hundreds of years ago, the marimba music came to Ecuador across the sea. Stormy drum rhythms and the gentle, undulating melodies remind us of the violence experienced during slave trade and colonial rule and also tell the story of the centuries-old musical resistance of the Afro-Ecuadorian community. \"\"The Whisper of the Marimba\"\" portrays three generations of musicians who lay bare their worries and dreams as well as their unshakable trust in the power of art and music to nurture their identity and community.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/eUnvsW7MccQZPq36luILmWun2ka.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Whisper of the Marimba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3430486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greta-Marie Becker","original_name":"Greta-Marie Becker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e46ae0b5fd6006a020fe8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851120,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marisol Barrientos Lima","original_name":"Marisol Barrientos Lima","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6669fc914837cebaaea72c0b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/eUnvsW7MccQZPq36luILmWun2ka.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Hofer Filmtage","release_date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
