The young French mountaineer Eric Escoffier prepares his equipment, very reduced in material and food. He leaves the next day and intends to chain three north faces in the Alps: Eiger, Matterhorn and Grandes Jorasses. The ascent of the first summit, the Eiger is slow, difficult and full of pitfalls. It takes 17 hours to reach it. Without recognizing the terrain -he prefers to improvise- the mountaineer continues through the Matterhorn. When night falls, anxiety is felt on Zermatt's side. Help is organized to pick him up. Despite his refusal to return, Escoffier is finally hoisted. Christophe Profit, a few hours earlier, managed the chain of three summits.","popularity":0.2982,"poster_path":"/mo7gyvy7o7kUg6H8vP4c1AL99LV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2668,"logo_path":"/wXmehIpEfAaJk7eU6GpBERpK3m1.png","name":"MC4","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":14411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinévision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faces
