Therefore, for the continuation of human society, all people who have been cured of ecological diseases should make an indelible mark on the back of their hands, in case they relapse at any time and lead to a larger scale of infection. They are called The Lurker. Fiction writer Teng is one of them. Teng met a girl called Ling Yan in the coffee shop he often goes to, and she is not a The Lurker.
