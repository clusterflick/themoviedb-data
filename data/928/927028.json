They will need all the help they can get, even from people they can't stand. They might even need help from above, or a 'Slay Masters' myth","popularity":0.0628,"poster_path":"/9t1ULaZk5zQebbnBJz6ubYFqKnE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flugbeittur Kuti","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"If they can't slay the fishes, they won't lay the Misses.","title":"Slay Masters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tómas Rúnar Sölvason","original_name":"Tómas Rúnar Sölvason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tommi","credit_id":"61e19672c4f5520041a9e106","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnús Traustason","original_name":"Magnús Traustason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maggi","credit_id":"61e1967e15dea00041029a06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Smelt","original_name":"Paul Smelt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Palli","credit_id":"61e19686d8e225001a70f13c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmar Ernir Viðarsson","original_name":"Elmar Ernir Viðarsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Emmi","credit_id":"61e1968d196757001c01406a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eyþór Bjarnason","original_name":"Eyþór Bjarnason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eyþór","credit_id":"61e1969512425c14d52e9f9f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jóhann Ólafur Högnason","original_name":"Jóhann Ólafur Högnason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jói","credit_id":"61e1969e8cfcc7001c00447a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Einar Ægir Hlynsson","original_name":"Einar Ægir Hlynsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gaui Kuti","credit_id":"61e196a6d8e225001a70f18d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pétur Geir Svavarsson","original_name":"Pétur Geir Svavarsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pési","credit_id":"61e196ad55c1f4001cc7e01b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3382536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wannawat Khinsanthia","original_name":"Wannawat Khinsanthia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"M","credit_id":"61e196b4bf0f6300411ec6ab","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Snævar Sölvason","original_name":"Snævar Sölvason","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Snævar","credit_id":"61e937cffdf8b700f54f3b40","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Snævar Sölvason","original_name":"Snævar Sölvason","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e196fc12425c006c4995fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Snævar Sölvason","original_name":"Snævar Sölvason","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e19705196757008b48c627","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Snævar Sölvason","original_name":"Snævar Sölvason","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e196cba0b6b500892fdfcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Snævar Sölvason","original_name":"Snævar Sölvason","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e196f18cfcc70041252068","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Snævar Sölvason","original_name":"Snævar Sölvason","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e196e8ffd44d006bcf66d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3239120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"1755175644786629","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9t1ULaZk5zQebbnBJz6ubYFqKnE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":842}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
