The various scenes of movement follow strict requirements. The man walks in different directions, overtaking the camera from behind, walking towards it, coming diagonally or straight from the depths of the room. Then, in panoramic view, he passes laterally in front of the camera. All moves are performed at three different distances from the camera: close, medium, and far. As a result, the character's size changes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qU8xprSgggICCWlDVNbLWdwps73.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Movimenti II/90","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"61e4bba535811d001c2d67e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qU8xprSgggICCWlDVNbLWdwps73.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
