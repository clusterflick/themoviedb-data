Oscar-nominated filmmaker Daniel Raim puts us in the director's chair and in Jewison's heart and mind, drawing on behind-the-scenes footage and never-before-seen stills as well as original interviews with Jewison, Topol (Tevye), composer John Williams, production designer Robert F. Boyle, film critic Kenneth Turan, lyricist Sheldon Harnick, and actresses Rosalind Harris, Michele Marsh, and Neva Small (Tevye’s daughters).  The film explores how the experience of making Fiddler deepened Jewison as an artist and revived his soul.","popularity":2.1337,"poster_path":"/2A1HgndiR4k5YLdQdHH5PA02Dyg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adama Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-29","revenue":6318,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A richly detailed examination of the nuts and bolts of moviemaking, this celebration of Norman Jewison’s \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" narrated by Jeff Goldblum, shows us how the beloved musical made its triumphant, hazardous journey to the screen.","title":"Fiddler's Journey to the Big Screen","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Goldblum","original_name":"Jeff Goldblum","popularity":3.3862,"profile_path":"/o3PahuK7OmCI0RAQUq38CUBWYZ9.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61e2804f12425c00449303e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Jewison","original_name":"Norman Jewison","popularity":0.4016,"profile_path":"/1lAQLc0csazVyRYpYgvePpOoKG7.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"self","credit_id":"61e28026196757008b4b6136","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":491,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Williams","original_name":"John Williams","popularity":1.3766,"profile_path":"/KFyMqUWeiBdP9tJcZyGWOqnrgK.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"self","credit_id":"61e28040ffd44d001c083008","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Topol","original_name":"Topol","popularity":0.3141,"profile_path":"/Ah6ZOrg9AmeqPU04qUGF5eon2Fv.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"self","credit_id":"61e2802f19675700414806bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":975522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosalind Harris","original_name":"Rosalind Harris","popularity":0.5485,"profile_path":"/aOvNYWqdxHkmCaYoMkoilNb7yOE.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"self","credit_id":"61e28062e0ec5100423809ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":161806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Marsh","original_name":"Michele Marsh","popularity":0.5898,"profile_path":"/wvas4169HW8dQCnEiYZthQLDE3E.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"self","credit_id":"61e2806ed8e2250098438b71","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":163645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neva Small","original_name":"Neva Small","popularity":0.2469,"profile_path":"/199GD6JcLxyvP1YOJ80IZDoqwes.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"self","credit_id":"61e2807acb30840068eb92f8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2657,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert F.
