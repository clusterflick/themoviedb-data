In fast single-frame mode, images change separated by black. Individual objects appear for varying lengths of time and are repeated in the same shot a different number of times. The black shots, like the images, are made up of precisely counted single frames. As a result, a rhythmically alternating sequence of images is produced, which, due to the interruption by black, causes the so-called flicker effect.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5IG63IHlCZlr8dpyTd4Utl1tg0D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Objekte (Flickerfilm)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"61e4bea5cae632006aa1f8d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5IG63IHlCZlr8dpyTd4Utl1tg0D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
