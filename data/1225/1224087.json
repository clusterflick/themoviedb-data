He is accompanied in this solitary life only by his young son, Paul, who, at the age of 21, has not seen anything of women or the world. One night, Paul walks in his sleep and wanders from his home. He falls into the company of his mother (whom he does not recognize), Bennett, and Bennett's beautiful ward, Helen, with whom Paul soon falls in love. After a series of thrilling adventures, Paul foils Bennett and reunites his parents; he and Helen hear wedding bells.","popularity":0.6228,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Booking Offices of America (FBO)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mysterious Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Talmadge","original_name":"Richard Talmadge","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/bpCmoCpLrSarWA9ttVJHLARDk1V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paul Lesage","credit_id":"658f4cf1d4cc8e600ce9c410","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Swickard","original_name":"Josef Swickard","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/fvkxWMqUjAmbHrBD1a0J2U4PIMO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Raoul Lesage","credit_id":"658f4cfed363e5509509d2c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":538924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmelita Geraghty","original_name":"Carmelita Geraghty","popularity":0.3482,"profile_path":"/f6TPMAjcb5dLcruNHXGFFpSHWhf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"April Lesage","credit_id":"658f4d0ed861af5e71ac29fe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheldon Lewis","original_name":"Sheldon Lewis","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/zsgNwtpLXyYSFJU0XeNECvVDlh9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herman Bennett","credit_id":"658f4d210e5aba73ec862874","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duane Thompson","original_name":"Duane Thompson","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/LziG2AJPCXtIeRMpEvcTha3ZMV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Helen Dresden","credit_id":"658f4d32d4cc8e5fb5e9c9f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stepin Fetchit","original_name":"Stepin Fetchit","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/dc4SOTvQahtWdciBadPqqSUAqvy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"658f4d549f1be70e0f80cc03","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Nelson","original_name":"Jack Nelson","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/287tmZiqPIXmMr1p88x2wBenWf2.jpg","credit_id":"658f4dfcd363e5509509d30b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763248,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Bell Smith","original_name":"James Bell Smith","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658f4e050e5aba72b6863949","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016139","wikidata_id":"Q104833734","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4271,"name":"hermit"},{"id":1326,"name":"infidelity"},{"id":10235,"name":"family relationships"},{"id":179878,"name":"sleepwalking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
