The musical, which quickly gained attention on social media after clips of a Pennsylvania workshop production were uploaded online, will play the international arts festival this summer, following additional revisions. The musical has already racked up more than 3 million likes on TikTok alone.  Co-written by Morgan Kennedy and Daniel Ruffing, the parody reimagines Edward and Bella as Edwin and Bia, with beloved characters from the cult franchise coming to life through a series of inside-baseball references, in addition to more open parody and satire.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gp63GcylLlXckW3ukYKkEm2WC2B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dusk: A Bite-Size Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gp63GcylLlXckW3ukYKkEm2WC2B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
