But when the eldest, Flavio, loses his life in an accident, the family falls apart: Elisabetta and Piero glare at each other and exchange ferocious jokes, unable to overcome that tragic event and not blame each other. It is the two remaining children, Dennis and Sara, who convince them to celebrate Christmas together in Cortina d'Ampezzo, the town where their maternal grandparents own a luxurious chalet. The two children have a plan, which will however be abruptly interrupted by an unexpected event. All the family dynamics will be called into question, and will keep everyone in suspense for a long night of waiting and reflections on the past.","popularity":0.4027,"poster_path":"/nWVR1C3zczfxBfdMCvbizTxsGQ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120216,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tramp
