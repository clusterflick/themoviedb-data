Because Alva has sworn vengeance, \"Sudden\" Duncan, the real murderer, accuses Donald's partner, Dick Randall, of the crime. Knowing that Dick is planning a journey across the desert, Duncan fills his canteen with poison, but Alva, who also is determined to kill Dick, drills a hole in the canteen so that the water will drain out. After Dick's departure, Alva learns from \"Tiger Lil',\" who is jealous of Duncan's attention to the Eastern newcomer, that it was Duncan who killed Donald. Frantic, Alva immediately mounts a horse and rides into the desert to save the man she now recognizes as her true love. Tiger Lil' shoots Duncan in a dance hall quarrel, and Alva marries Dick.","popularity":0.8194,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16101,"logo_path":"/2yI4rjPZ1I7TLZ2UWvTtXifYEnw.png","name":"Metro Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Storey","original_name":"Edith Storey","popularity":0.1884,"profile_path":"/r8iO5KZFDf3V7o13KWlB67iuWZK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Alva Leigh","credit_id":"659086ae651fcf5fcd8daa49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wheeler Oakman","original_name":"Wheeler Oakman","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/4F4BCjUnk4h8P2QLRaKhE46OJSC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dick Randall","credit_id":"659086b4028f14241dc54e16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Lewis","original_name":"Ralph Lewis","popularity":0.2402,"profile_path":"/hcZEuTJlj57Eapbtp103IMq7DVP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"\"Sudden\" Duncan","credit_id":"659086bcce4ddc6e647d6702","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberta Ballard","original_name":"Alberta Ballard","popularity":0.1896,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"\"Tiger Lil'\"","credit_id":"659086d4e004a66d6317324c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Donald Jaffray","credit_id":"659086f11dcb776bd644d97f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Browning","original_name":"Tod Browning","popularity":0.2784,"profile_path":"/9iVkFjCS86V1UzcBERvHFjT58RC.jpg","credit_id":"659085eef5f1c577bc008432","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.P.
