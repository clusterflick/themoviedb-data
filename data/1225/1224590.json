The other reference in their conversation is the execution of dozens of animals at the Yuanshan Zoo in Taiwan in 1944, intended to prevent civilian casualties caused by animals after the US military had bombed the cities. These unfortunate animals were later turned into taxidermy. Drawing on these historical observations, ‘The Zoo Hypothesis’ explores the role of technology in archiving the world and constructing human memory. At its center lie the tense relationships between animals and humans, and between matter and memory.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Zoo Hypothesis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2521149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hsu Che-yu","original_name":"Hsu Che-yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659113f664f716662d8eeeef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912608,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chen Wan-Yin","original_name":"Chen Wan-Yin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6591140cebb99d5e6d9e6516","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tQ9RjahbttoAF4j6gcCQSX0o05y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kuandu Museum of Fine Arts","release_date":"2023-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
