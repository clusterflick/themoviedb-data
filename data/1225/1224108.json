They persuade 24-year-old Hillevi to film her script about a strong woman who is not afraid to break convention. Axel finances the film through a loan and a promise to his father to become a lawyer if it fails. They manage to get along with Rebecka, 21, a beautiful and semi-famous actress. Melvin falls in love with Hillevi, who in turn falls in love with Rebecka, a triangle drama that creates problems for director Axel. The drama not only tests their ability to finish the film, but also their friendship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sommaren 89'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12015648","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
