This is a funny, bitter-sweet silent comedy, an odyssey through a Newcastle cityscape in transition from an industrial Tyneside to T Dan Smiths modernist vision of the city as a Brasilia of the North. Directed by Robert Tyrell, it is also a brilliant social document of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the 1960s.","popularity":0.2024,"poster_path":"/6cdiIiGZ4kpiV6mvo4WXz2DaXpH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Comedy","title":"Turn-up for Tony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Tanner","original_name":"Tony Tanner","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/y6TB0Lf8MHMSOWjO7qch7nZSXTi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"65914b0c1dcb776b194549d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Mitchell","original_name":"Norman Mitchell","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":"/ovQPZe275HaBuVGOV1QwbMk67UB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"65914b21e004a66e23173108","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheila Falconer","original_name":"Sheila Falconer","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tony's girlfriend","credit_id":"65914b3af5f1c576f900d55d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1000273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Lune","original_name":"Ted Lune","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Old man","credit_id":"65914b4a4f9a9973e4776cf6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Tyrell","original_name":"Robert Tyrell","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65914babce4ddc6d907dc18f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457150,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eric Coop","original_name":"Eric Coop","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65914bc1ebb99d5f7e9df4be","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6cdiIiGZ4kpiV6mvo4WXz2DaXpH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":845}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
