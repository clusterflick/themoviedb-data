The befriended person is so grateful to the Colonel that he lets the Colonel drink as much as he likes, with the result that the Colonel gets somewhat stewed. The Colonel is certainly in very good spirits and has very good spirits in him, which accounts for the extraordinary occurrences which happen on the way to his downy (?) couch. The world seems to go spinning around as he makes his uncertain way through the streets. How he finally makes his entrance into his house is as funny as it is unusual.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colonel Heeza Liar Signs the Pledge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110408,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Randolph Bray","original_name":"John Randolph Bray","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/mdWa0YdpPaZvpprJqD2kRjDGuyg.jpg","credit_id":"658f58da81c7be5ede724a0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0005111","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1915-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
