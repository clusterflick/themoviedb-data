How can we speak the language of queerness when our languages, terms, expressions are trapped within and abbreviated into an international queer (English) language? How are we pressured into partaking in the norms of acceptable “queerness”? What are the costs of not fitting into these norms, and how can we counter this regulatory and disciplinary function of queerness at our current historical moment?’","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/33fLkNhubNF5TKnHGPWvoPeRV1A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Queer Arab Dichotomy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4454355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmad Baba","original_name":"Ahmad Baba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658f3cf96611b46c02a40f8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/33fLkNhubNF5TKnHGPWvoPeRV1A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
