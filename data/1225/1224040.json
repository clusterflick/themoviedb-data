When Tom receives word that his father has lost his fortune and he must quit school, he loses the remainder of his money in a poker game. Meanwhile, Olga inherits her Uncle Sven's fortune when he dies, but the will stipulates that she will receive the money only if she marries before her next birthday. She marries Gordon to get him out of debt but he spurns her affections because he thinks that she is socially inferior. They soon separate, and she goes out West where she falls into the clutches of nefarious fortune hunters who say that they will make a lady of her. Gordon returns to school and later, when she has become a \"lady,\" they meet again. Through a misunderstanding they quarrel, but eventually Gordon realizes that she is being used by criminals and he saves her, after which they start their marriage over.","popularity":0.23,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jesse L.
