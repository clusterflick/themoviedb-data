Using original film and archive footage, it examines the working lives of seamen and the battles fought by their union from the sailing ships of colonial days to the modern turbine-powered container vessels. Because the Seamen’s Union was frequently at the forefront of working-class struggle in New Zealand, its story involves most of the crucial issues and events in the history of the union movement generally, including the great maritime strikes of 1890 and 1913 and the waterfront dispute of 1951.","popularity":1.0038,"poster_path":"/wWA7OrkHsjtPTJbiRSZvy9IE2B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":614,"logo_path":"/3pP50VnBQPVjstomuCnCvUGgsfP.png","name":"Vanguard Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Century of Struggle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Des Kelly","original_name":"Des Kelly","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6590c2b751a64e041af42bf7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alister Barry","original_name":"Alister Barry","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590c25564f71665808ef49f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Russell Campbell","original_name":"Russell Campbell","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590c2764f9a99738e774e91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716584,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rod Prosser","original_name":"Rod Prosser","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590c28de640d60140d57af4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wWA7OrkHsjtPTJbiRSZvy9IE2B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
