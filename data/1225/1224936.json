Through conversations, and the solving of word puzzles with her daughter, a story emerges about the relationship between memory and the texture of experience.  Shot on location in Eugene, North Bend/Coos Bay, and many points between, memory based recollection provided the shot list for Direct Route ​in lieu of the visually motivated process of traditional location scouting. The use of tools for non­visual navigation serve as counterpoint to the landscape images.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Direct Route","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pam Minty","original_name":"Pam Minty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65921550651fcf5f138e6e05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
