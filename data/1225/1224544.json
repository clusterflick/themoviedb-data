With her wife Ida, she is packing up her life as a musician and heading north. Rakel is enthusiastic, but she is also aware that there is a lot she doesn’t know how to handle. Her wife Ida has never lived on a farm before and will also have to find her place in this new everyday life and this unfamiliar work. Rakel’s father has been a farmer for 40 years and knows the challenges ahead of her: years when spring never arrives, summers with significant losses to predators, poor harvests, and sheep on the run.","popularity":0.0709,"poster_path":"/95cOQ1cTMyFAQQ6fBEfCXZT0lOE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114922,"logo_path":"/9WJhF9t3emtELsSgyfEKuTqi0Sg.png","name":"f(x) produksjoner","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2024-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woolly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1485306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebekka Nystabakk","original_name":"Rebekka Nystabakk","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/yyxA4QVQYGG2RZhlAGrbbghi5ze.jpg","credit_id":"6590d6771dcb776bd644f5ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1485306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebekka Nystabakk","original_name":"Rebekka Nystabakk","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/yyxA4QVQYGG2RZhlAGrbbghi5ze.jpg","credit_id":"6590d67ee004a66cec1761de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Benedikte Bredesen","original_name":"Benedikte Bredesen","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590d69b1bf87650deccd725","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eirik Evjen","original_name":"Eirik Evjen","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/xyemFI9onk2SyaVCErsbJvLfm5r.jpg","credit_id":"6590d960f5f1c5783200848b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29940062","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pTOy2atkEjmtf9e6K6V5DHRGJxF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dNbT7dv7dc8AC8qADqiOeY6KVhc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fYD4wdlNjoPfz11eUSpdhFzvcAa.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/95cOQ1cTMyFAQQ6fBEfCXZT0lOE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/pvt27OUdSFEKspYp0FMKUZYat8E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tromsø International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
