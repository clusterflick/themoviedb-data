But almost 50 years after its construction, the A45 has become the country's biggest problem child. For the people of Sauerland and Siegerland, the A45 was a road of hope - the starting signal for the economic region of South Westphalia. A place of longing and a destination for drives. Since December 2, 2021, 3 p.m., nothing in Lüdenscheid has been the same. The big problem: there is no hope of improvement in the short term. Since spring 2022, it has been clear that the highway closure will last for years.","popularity":0.2992,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A45 - Königin der Autobahnen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"A45 - Die Königin der Autobahnen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Wagemeyer","original_name":"Sebastian Wagemeyer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65917327ebb99d5ec29e4e0c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Erbismann","original_name":"Katharina Erbismann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659173814f9a9974be774609","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp Schepmann","original_name":"Philipp Schepmann","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":"/hINSI3YcDsi4xcNCRCQ3oCPKVAN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6591749da589027119965500","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wieseler","original_name":"Michael Wieseler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6591742fa58902717f963f2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457388,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kopter Hagen","original_name":"Kopter Hagen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659174701dcb776b194557a5","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Cinematographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clemens Gersch","original_name":"Clemens Gersch","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6591741f651fcf603f8daef5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457389,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Elke Baulig","original_name":"Elke Baulig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659174af651fcf5f138e3578","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457385,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Felicitas Klopp","original_name":"Felicitas Klopp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659174474f9a99765d770241","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457386,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Verena Klein","original_name":"Verena Klein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65917457651fcf61548d8711","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wieseler","original_name":"Michael Wieseler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6591747aebb99d5e179eaf20","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Cinematographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457384,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jürgen Behrens","original_name":"Jürgen Behrens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65917439e004a66d6317749a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2565490,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Barbara Schmitz","original_name":"Barbara Schmitz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659174bba5890271eb962742","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3306,"name":"highway"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"WDR","release_date":"2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
