Jim is welcomed by Kate Taggart, the village storekeeper's daughter, and their attachment deepens until Gabrielle returns after being deserted by her paramour, and Jim forgives her for their son's sake. Meanwhile, Ben Merrill, an unscrupulous contractor who has built the town levee, fears that the structure will not hold the coming flood waters. Merrill destroys the levee and attempts to place the blame on Jim and Banty Tim. In the flood, Gabrielle is killed, but before dying, she exposes Merrill as the man for whom she had deserted her home. This information reaches Jim when he and Merrill are aboard the boat The Prairie Bell . In the ensuing fight, the ship catches fire and explodes. Rescued from the debris by Banty Tim, Jim marries Kate and begins a new life.","popularity":0.1766,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":36191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fine Arts Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jim Bludso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Lucas","original_name":"Wilfred Lucas","popularity":0.3261,"profile_path":"/rr70uPoMMtkHFYSPn0JTwI9ikQ9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jim Bludso","credit_id":"6590822b651fcf60fa8d8850","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Grey","original_name":"Olga Grey","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/bJT1haLoCoUsk1xeP3vpNvphWuo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gabrielle","credit_id":"659082326aa8e06153eae24e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgie Stone","original_name":"Georgie Stone","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/uqv8YqxYKLpID78tGQK0D0IIhba.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Little Breeches","credit_id":"6590833b1dcb776bd644d8e4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Lee","original_name":"Charles Lee","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tom Taggart","credit_id":"65908314e640d602e2d54de6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1395652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winifred Westover","original_name":"Winifred Westover","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/h2Ii1o9FotrQPGGQb4vpReU7xJZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Kate Taggart","credit_id":"659083501bf87653f1ccb1bb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam De Grasse","original_name":"Sam De Grasse","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/qiMJezjBhoygL6UDnGxF1wfqBm1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ben Merrill","credit_id":"6590835ba58902711995f882","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3650060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James O'Shea","original_name":"James O'Shea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Banty Tim","credit_id":"65908377651fcf5eba8de73a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Blue","original_name":"Monte Blue","popularity":0.3353,"profile_path":"/f9VVvlkPviIaHfcW8fog8JwYUvP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Joe Bowers","credit_id":"6590838157176f696f7fd6f6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Browning","original_name":"Tod Browning","popularity":0.2784,"profile_path":"/9iVkFjCS86V1UzcBERvHFjT58RC.jpg","credit_id":"65908245e004a66cec173de5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Browning","original_name":"Tod Browning","popularity":0.2784,"profile_path":"/9iVkFjCS86V1UzcBERvHFjT58RC.jpg","credit_id":"6590823c51a64e04e8f417bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983624,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alfred Gosden","original_name":"Alfred Gosden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659082766aa8e0639fea8459","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Lucas","original_name":"Wilfred Lucas","popularity":0.3261,"profile_path":"/rr70uPoMMtkHFYSPn0JTwI9ikQ9.jpg","credit_id":"65908292651fcf5f138dd406","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008148","wikidata_id":"Q3808308","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
