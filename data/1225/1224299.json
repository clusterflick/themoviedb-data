The stories of five sets of characters, suspended in time and space, unfold and collide on the very same road, set against a soundtrack by the Armenian-Australian jazz band, Zela Margossian Quintet.  “Each of the five narratives in our work are centred around decisive moments in people’s lives; from this point forward these characters will be forever changed as they undergo some sort of renewal, redemption or transcendence,” says director Charlotte Mungomery. “We were also interested in the conceptual and almost existential notion of a road and humanity’s attempt to control the uncontrollable and tame the untameable.”","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/8wfhMaWqZJVkICHvFrw12t9kfJY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455580,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zela Margossian Quintet","original_name":"Zela Margossian Quintet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590225d4f9a997447770f27","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4056096,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ella Butler","original_name":"Ella Butler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65902298f5f1c576f9008799","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632751,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Baldwin","original_name":"Chris Baldwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659022a451a64e0271f43194","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298689,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dimitri Zaunders","original_name":"Dimitri Zaunders","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/uZfTV2lG5SSForAls2xR4el2Tbb.jpg","credit_id":"6590228e41a56167ff0459b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919844,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yanni Kronenberg","original_name":"Yanni Kronenberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659022ba41a56167310470c6","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2926449,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Charlotte Mungomery","original_name":"Charlotte Mungomery","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65902251ebb99d5e179e129b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Lamond","original_name":"Rebecca Lamond","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65902285f5f1c57690008fdc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455585,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tegan Jeffrey-Rushton","original_name":"Tegan Jeffrey-Rushton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659022b0a58902711995e030","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8wfhMaWqZJVkICHvFrw12t9kfJY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
