She meets Bernard Dufrene and a flirtation develops into an intense love on her part. She is in despair when she discovers that he already has a wife and child. To visit them and announce herself as the mistress of the husband and father is her first idea, but the charm of the child restrains her. She cannot strike the blow and passes off her visit with an improvised excuse. She dismisses Bernard and returns to the stage, where she gains real fame as a dramatic artist. Once more he seeks her, but again the memory of the child saves her to her better self.","popularity":0.1233,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":25599,"logo_path":"/sPZZwYvN3xEGo7q8E9iYKrggjDz.png","name":"Famous Players Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zaza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Frederick","original_name":"Pauline Frederick","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/oZkkaaZf07bEa3LT0YXMoGlcqSm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zaza","credit_id":"659097ffe004a66c95174e4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian L'Estrange","original_name":"Julian L'Estrange","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bernard Dufrene","credit_id":"6590980ba58902711995fc4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Sinclair","original_name":"Ruth Sinclair","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Madame Dufrene","credit_id":"6590987e6aa8e061abead4a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2907417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maud Granger","original_name":"Maud Granger","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Aunt Rosa","credit_id":"65909854028f147694c5528b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3565087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Fisher","original_name":"Blanche Fisher","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Louise","credit_id":"6590988f1bf8765141ccb62d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Sinnott","original_name":"Helen Sinnott","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nathalie","credit_id":"659098a2a58902711995fc67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Craven","original_name":"Walter Craven","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dubois","credit_id":"659098d4651fcf5fcd8dac96","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugh Ford","original_name":"Hugh Ford","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":"/6mBEllI9vZXfan9ysVuZdxPUVVJ.jpg","credit_id":"659094e664f71665808eda01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin S.
