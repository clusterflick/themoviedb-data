Sahakian set up the initiative, which ran from 2011 to 2015, in order to support Baghdad-based artists facing the damage done to the contemporary art infrastructure in Iraq after cycles of war, destruction, sanctions, and continual political insecurity.  For «documenta fifteen», Sahakian invited former participants of Sada to produce video work reflecting on their practice and where they are today. The participating artists are Sajjad Abbas, Bassim Al Shaker, Layth Kareem, Ali Eyal, Raed Mutar, Sarah Munaf, and Sahakian herself. This almanac is a valuable historical document about a country destroyed by a bloody war.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SADA","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3738868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Munaf","original_name":"Sarah Munaf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634822950e29a20090810490","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3738864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bassim Al Shaker","original_name":"Bassim Al Shaker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6348226e6a300b007d228814","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3738866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Eyal","original_name":"Ali Eyal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63482281cf4a64007a052757","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3738867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raed Mutar","original_name":"Raed Mutar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6348228bdcf875007ee223aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laith Kareem","original_name":"Laith Kareem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634822770e29a2007eeee14e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3738863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sajjad Abbas","original_name":"Sajjad Abbas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63482265d34eb3009037e75b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3738869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rijin Sahakian","original_name":"Rijin Sahakian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6348229e006b01007a069789","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
