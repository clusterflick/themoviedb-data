The idea is if she sees him she will be disillusioned. A few hunters spying the \"wolves\" shoot with intent to kill, and a real bear enters the hut and scatters the plotters. The scheme works well, even with all these inconveniences, until a genuine Mountie appears on the scene and administers punishment to the arch-villain and his dwarf-like henchman. As a result the girl's romantic imagination vindicates her beau ideal. The two lovers are last seen standing chest-deep in the snow.","popularity":0.376,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christie Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1922-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viora Daniel","original_name":"Viora Daniel","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/8mP8zubwVqZNnM8VlwfS91WNSFu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mabel- Romantic Heroine","credit_id":"6344b5f5cffeed00818219a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Edwards","original_name":"Harry Edwards","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/eQmV6lcrC3uBMjA0IhSGRQ1DgmU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Superintendent","credit_id":"6344b60b9c97bd00796dac02","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Murdock","original_name":"Henry Murdock","popularity":0.0674,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Half-Breed Villain","credit_id":"6344b624b7a154007cc72d9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cogley","original_name":"Nick Cogley","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/lbIxmCvhMbjFDne97WFvqAv10KG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"??","credit_id":"6344b6375b4fed0091d98a89","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096014,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Earle Rodney","original_name":"Earle Rodney","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/jSY5oOEWd2fLcjj1Al86HE7AMst.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Old Trapper","credit_id":"6344b6497a97ab0082819a02","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bletcher","original_name":"Billy Bletcher","popularity":0.4537,"profile_path":"/ncapDtCeDsMJxEKFXocJTFfnpau.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pride of the Mounted","credit_id":"6344b65ad55c3d0091b534e8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Palmer","original_name":"Patricia Palmer","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/u9cyEeRkOYdcxPCliqqWGMSnpyj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Wronged Woman","credit_id":"6344b67b25b955007a8bab96","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ward Caulfield","original_name":"Ward Caulfield","popularity":0.0565,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"First Wolf","credit_id":"6344b692cf62cd007ead9fca","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George B.
