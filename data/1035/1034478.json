The camera pans swiftly from left to right, looking at what´s going on. The beat sets the tempo. The car´s put into gear: Take-off.  The story plays out in the viewers´ head rather than in front of their eyes. [n:ja] shows nothing more than pure motion along spatial coordinates which is driven by Radian´s pulsing soundtrack. So much \"reality\" – in other words details, color and representation – has been removed from the original views of this ride that solely remnants and a basic structure comprise the video image. In the first \"shot\" we seem to recognize passers-by hurrying in different directions. The point-of-view moves in the opposite direction, following individuals until two parallel lines running from left to right enter the frame as a graphic element, seeming to set our eyes on a rail.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jkbA1GjEw2XarCPgkbN9nL7ohr0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"frame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2091720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annja Krautgasser","original_name":"Annja Krautgasser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9reOHH8jklNtFKcGwCocYpy40mv.jpg","credit_id":"6345ff7500fb6b00812e9866","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jkbA1GjEw2XarCPgkbN9nL7ohr0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
