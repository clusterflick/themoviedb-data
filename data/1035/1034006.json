Our swamplands have been replaced by reservoirs and fish ponds, and our largest floodplain is now an arid lowland wilderness. Today, 75% of our lakes are artificial and 90% of our floodplains are gone. But wildlife has had to adapt to this changing world or face extinction.\r Surprisingly, our artificial lakes provide the last refuge for some rare aquatic ecosystems and our former floodplains provide temporary shelter for hundreds of thousands of migrating birds during the winter. But this world is no longer governed by nature, but by man.\r In this new nature documentary from the creators of the highly successful Where Rivers Run Wild: Aqua Hungarica, the man-made aquatic world is revealed in stunning new images. From the crane migration in the Hortobágy National Park to the hidden labyrinths of Lake Tisza, the winter marshes of the Hungarian Great Plains and the jellyfish hovering in crystal clear mine lakes.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/ur3eI84s9IBpNEKhgrwN42j5tla.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vad Víz Stúdió","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2022-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Waters: Created by Man, Overtaken by Nature","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernő Fekete","original_name":"Ernő Fekete","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/gaOa3DiUYTOZ7bCITppMkLaYvVq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6345341a5b4fed0091d9bd40","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3112650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoltán Fehér","original_name":"Fehér Zoltán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344625ad55c3d007dec835d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3112650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoltán Fehér","original_name":"Fehér Zoltán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6345345dd34eb3007e7b381e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3112650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoltán Fehér","original_name":"Fehér Zoltán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6345342e5b4fed007fe7e6b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3735870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Máté Majoros","original_name":"Majoros Máté","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6345346af3b49a009054430f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735871,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Two Steps From Hell","original_name":"Two Steps From Hell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634534a41b7c59007e6e7d79","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bleeding Fingers Music","original_name":"Bleeding Fingers Music","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634534926a300b0091a06056","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4873880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franciska Pőcze","original_name":"Franciska Pőcze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4914f0bcb472b14e93571","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3302594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcell Costa","original_name":"Marcell Koszta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b491e3b5b2b969378b6fb9","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3112650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoltán Fehér","original_name":"Fehér Zoltán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a698638d26a2a6372a683","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":927,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6gLeTdAIThdWdcFFCnxZAXgK56y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1648}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":927,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/ur3eI84s9IBpNEKhgrwN42j5tla.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":655}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
