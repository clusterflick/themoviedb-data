Initially she faces the seismic truth that her father, Reginald Winthrop, who could trace his heritage literally to the founders of America, is not her biological father. When Reg and his beautiful French Canadian wife Claire have their “miracle child”, Viviane is raised as an heir to the historic Winthrop exceptionalism and finds pride in her career in dentistry. After she is contacted by an unknown relative through their Ancestry DNA test, Viviane embraces her new identity, where she finds peace after facing powerful themes about love, blood and family.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/m3cNaySfB1n2Hy01gEWxJRpg5KV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if everything you believed about yourself was a lie?","title":"The Last of the Winthrops","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Beigel","original_name":"Bill Beigel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634727a6d34eb30090377cac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Blackburn","original_name":"David Blackburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634727c60e64af0090ef7362","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Guiraud de Saint-Eymart","original_name":"Xavier Guiraud de Saint-Eymart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634727e1f3b49a009054e93c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Durand","original_name":"Bertram Durand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63472816b3e6270082824b21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celia Heritage","original_name":"Celia Heritage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634728266a300b0091a11f32","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Larsen","original_name":"Rick Larsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634728326a300b007a259de0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre Metcalf","original_name":"Andre Metcalf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63472841006b01008215e99e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Noto","original_name":"Jason Noto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63472854dcf875007ee1b532","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Perez","original_name":"Andrew Perez","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6347286851c01f0079115c88","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Perez","original_name":"Danny Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6347287871ffdf007fb1c065","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Perez","original_name":"Jacques Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634729760e64af0090ef73b7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Perez","original_name":"Monique Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63472985dcf8750090a58b71","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bela Schellenberg","original_name":"Brian Bela Schellenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634729955b4fed0091da604c","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Winthrop","original_name":"Claire Winthrop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634729a37eb5f20083cf9f8e","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viviane Winthrop","original_name":"Viviane Winthrop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634729b4f621b2007ed0e882","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viviane Winthrop","original_name":"Viviane Winthrop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63472d6007e281007a05ce24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam K.
