His landlady has become very skeptical of both him and his invention, perhaps mainly due to the fact that he is constantly broke and hasn't paid the rent in months. Adding to the irritation is that the hostess's daughter loves the young man and is trying to convince her employer, the director, to finance the whole thing. The director wants both her and the television set, but his evil investment doesn't come to fruition thanks to the latter.","popularity":0.2103,"poster_path":"/ntrh4wgcQnZknTKZHwEvtqylz59.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Studios Paramount","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1931-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Television: Swedish Version","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margita Alfvén","original_name":"Margita Alfvén","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/op2bio5cK24VdgFHDH0sMbO1LKa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6344af8c9c97bd00796da7d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rune Andersson","original_name":"Rune Andersson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fnmZmQJfuw6Xf2srXMdCmg3wWsV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6344af946a300b007d211d37","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560028,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Weyler Hildebrand","original_name":"Weyler Hildebrand","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/sFG5H8Aalt0SYoJRzQJVHkWh4aY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6344af9e71ffdf007fb0a211","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torben Meyer","original_name":"Torben Meyer","popularity":0.192,"profile_path":"/A5TLcObSezrwH2u5FCfi6mY69Z9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6344afa66a300b0091a01fe8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1696530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Seelig","original_name":"Paul Seelig","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6344afad9c97bd00903b3af0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":573780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Swanström","original_name":"Karin Swanström","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":"/1guVGdYrIqnBtTgmUlVlo40mBvE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6344afb4d6c300007aa308e8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ragnar Widestedt","original_name":"Ragnar Widestedt","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/49nSoaVgrQtekR4IiH7iY8EWjLu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6344afbe9c97bd00903b3af5","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735368,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick Lindh","original_name":"Frederick Lindh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344af659c97bd007c21bd5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735368,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick Lindh","original_name":"Frederick Lindh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344af5d9c97bd007c21bd53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071180,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Howard Irving Young","original_name":"Howard Irving Young","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344af817a97ab007a9cca83","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106015,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Theodore J.
