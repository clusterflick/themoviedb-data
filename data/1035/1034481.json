It was the the Carnegie Hall magic all over again and this time we had a camera crew to capture the entire event -- available now for the first time on this DVD. The repertoire is mostly from the We'll Be Together Again album, with the special bonus of the newly-constituted Basie band. This was to be Lena's final concert performance and in every respect it's a stunning summation to a most extraordinary career.","popularity":0.1671,"poster_path":"/gvQzNbNMvWGsmcQc56KgCTxGPFU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening With Lena Horne","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Horne","original_name":"Lena Horne","popularity":0.3595,"profile_path":"/vk6Z28XELYgfB1hgnoHsyRoIMll.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"63460458cf62cd007b4c2b6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3736698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Renzi","original_name":"Mike Renzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"piano, synthesizer","credit_id":"6346049ff3b49a00905474a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3096619,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rodney Jones","original_name":"Rodney Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"guitar","credit_id":"634604b3cdf2e6007f32846b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3736699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Harrison","original_name":"Donald Harrison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"tenor sax","credit_id":"634604e4cf62cd007eae0d7b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3736700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Brown","original_name":"Ben Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"63460502cdf2e6007ad28a95","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3736701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akira Tana","original_name":"Akira Tana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"63460512cf62cd007b4c2c8e","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gvQzNbNMvWGsmcQc56KgCTxGPFU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
