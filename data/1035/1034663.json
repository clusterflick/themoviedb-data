While on tour promoting his latest movie \"Son Of The Sheik\", Rudolph Valentino, the Hollywood silent screen icon, suffers a sudden collapse and is hospitalized at the New York Polyclinic Hospital. After the emergency surgery, Valentino loses his grip of reality and sees visions of his past life in Hollywood in a perspective of a coma - as a silent film screening at a movie palace, the magical portal between reality and illusion, between life and eternity... Dubbed \"The Great Lover\" around the world, Valentino reigns the screen as a dashing and virile \"Sheik\" and drives his female audience in hysteria. Off screen, however, his private life is a complete failure - the Sheik cannot satisfy even his own domineering wife. Snapping back to reality, Valentino finds himself abandoned, alone and stricken with illness.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of the Sheik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2845290,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladislav Kozlov","original_name":"Vladislav Kozlov","popularity":0.0615,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6346c706d55c3d007a1b0a8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21997504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
