Over the course of 60 minutes, film sequences, montages, theme songs and  nocturnal presentations alternate between the early nineties and the end  of the 2000s. Fuori Orario is seen fragmentarily, it is thought first of all by  separating image and sound: only inside the museum can it be heard and  only outside can it be seen. In both cases, the work is made up of superimpositions,  forms and words that escape and chase each other. Entering the  endless night, the impossibility of an absolute gaze is increasingly revealed.  In the construction of the sequences, the previous thought is not forgotten,  but it is recontextualized within the same frame, it is put back into the discourse,  conscious but uncontrolled reactivation.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/4lgQVISIRZxhggIZJxBIdjlf0Sy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"fuori fuori orario","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Zanatta","original_name":"Francesco Zanatta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634537369bcd0f007d317ec1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Zanatta","original_name":"Francesco Zanatta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634537402dffd8007fe7342e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4lgQVISIRZxhggIZJxBIdjlf0Sy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
