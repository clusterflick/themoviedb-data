He walks from Frankfurt am Main to Frankfurt (Oder). Most of the time on foot, on partly ancient paths, he crosses five federal states of a country that is slowly recovering from the mildew that has settled over Germany. Some things, like climate change or the open wounds of the landscapes, are clear, other things reveal themselves more at second glance. He encounters inspiring people, bizarre buildings and half a dozen rivers, but also the spirit and ghosts of fascism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dYEthTZT9pkRScQNV648no9uxoZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Querfeldein - Von Frankfurt nach Frankfurt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schuch","original_name":"Christoph Schuch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63466890f621b2007ed0a88d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1085,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYEthTZT9pkRScQNV648no9uxoZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
