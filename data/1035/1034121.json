New York's little known or understood underground steam pipes provide the necessary heat and hot water for everything from Chinese laundries and Turkish baths to the World Trade Center and the Empire State Building. A thousand engineering hours behind a schedule and way over budget, Honeybee Robotics, W.I.S.O.R.'s creators, are worried. They argue, discuss God, baseball, and technology and ultimately lead us into a futuristic world originally thought impossible in this eerie, stranger than fiction tale set in the city beneath the city.","popularity":0.1027,"poster_path":"/jQCKcEU9XY7wwv6WoLxJKxvefju.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Robo-Welder","title":"W.I.S.O.R.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Bartenieff","original_name":"George Bartenieff","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":"/kGBaoGch5yNbepe9WvnUDC3DSJU.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6344ac38cf62cd007ead99ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babi Floyd","original_name":"Babi Floyd","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6344ac442dffd8008211d5a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Giles","original_name":"Gilbert Giles","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6344ac4f25b95500822b471a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274021,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Beo Morales","original_name":"Beo Morales","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344ac0cd34eb30079fdfcb2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Negroponte","original_name":"Michel Negroponte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344ac1b9c97bd007c21bc97","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Negroponte","original_name":"Michel Negroponte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344ab66c3bffe007cc20442","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Negroponte","original_name":"Michel Negroponte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344abc8cffeed007c787c5f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080872,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jane Weiner","original_name":"Jane Weiner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344abe99bcd0f007af9d2df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421265,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carrie Giunta","original_name":"Carrie Giunta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344abff25b955007d72d6cc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156888,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tom Cross","original_name":"Tom Cross","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/wbVgrmQKnDmBjqk0RNMgXTCE90m.jpg","credit_id":"6344ac24b7a1540090c3d1f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Negroponte","original_name":"Michel Negroponte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344ab8b7a97ab0082819419","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735361,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabriel Morgan","original_name":"Gabriel Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344ab82d6c300007aa30821","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0288880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jQCKcEU9XY7wwv6WoLxJKxvefju.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
