Wifey suspects that his object is chasing chickens - those that walk with two feet - and so starts in pursuit. When hubby's pals get a ducking in the water, they are forced to go to a neighboring farmhouse where the farmer's daughters dress them up in feminine clothing until their own is dried. And the young bride frowns and pouts and stirs up some trouble before she finds out that the girls have a distinct place in the plot.","popularity":0.2593,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christie Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1920-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ducks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096014,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Earle Rodney","original_name":"Earle Rodney","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/jSY5oOEWd2fLcjj1Al86HE7AMst.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hubby","credit_id":"6344b2f7c3bffe007941ef8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Darling","original_name":"Helen Darling","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/vUvKalXLfM5lIJISo3N8fvRnAAS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wifey","credit_id":"6344b302d55c3d007a1a4fe3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"6344b3455b4fed007fe79f45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332580,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Roland Conklin","original_name":"Frank Roland Conklin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344b31fd6c300007f5f2160","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3014932","wikidata_id":"Q114253941","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4932,"name":"farm"},{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"},{"id":213070,"name":"duck hunt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Limited premiere","release_date":"1920-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
