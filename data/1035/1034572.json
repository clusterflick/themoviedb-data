Instead of a young man being tortured by language, we meet an old woman played by the director’s mother, Libgart Schwarz, who loses her linguistic abilities while rehearsing for the very same play. What begins as a pure and playful family meta-fiction turns into a surreal, partly nonsensical Babylonian confusion, it’s just that it’s not different languages that are clashing but layers and fragments of the German language, the language of the father. The film avoids the traps of representational cinema. It’s all noises and muttering, injunctions and an almost Dadaist pleasure in repeating sentences until they completely lose their meaning.","popularity":0.1271,"poster_path":"/jJquusCpfPqgUzIIGgZxZAkwb9P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184036,"logo_path":null,"name":"FAD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2022-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Sentence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1265262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Libgart Schwarz","original_name":"Libgart Schwarz","popularity":0.1392,"profile_path":"/cTXRCE8x0PUCw6VKGgbC88KMjaw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63466d115b4fed007ae86693","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Illich","original_name":"Helga Illich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63466d1a71ffdf007a264ae9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Peters","original_name":"Caroline Peters","popularity":0.313,"profile_path":"/AeBxK1HDfrBaLpuexORgNZLwRck.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63466d25d6c3000082191ac5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888792,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amina Handke","original_name":"Amina Handke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6700efb47830c1301e7cf35a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Achatz","original_name":"Markus Achatz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6700efbc925fdf925b7cfac0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122847,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marianne Andrea Borowiec","original_name":"Marianne Andrea Borowiec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63466e1f5b4fed007fe86cda","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1788360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tong Zhang","original_name":"Tong Zhang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63466d77b7a154007cc7d878","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888792,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amina Handke","original_name":"Amina Handke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63466d57f3b49a009054a952","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888792,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amina Handke","original_name":"Amina Handke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63466d64b3e627007a1e33f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888792,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amina Handke","original_name":"Amina Handke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63466d3cd6c300007aa3c260","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888792,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amina Handke","original_name":"Amina Handke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63466d4a00fb6b00812ed034","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22871352","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/svYOhY38WkoumxfpPhka25YZ2L8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jJquusCpfPqgUzIIGgZxZAkwb9P.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1051,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sEsCHTn8IoYYKT87MudOolGQ5Nw.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":708},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/aYNHldX9de1y8enMZLq9zgsUZj5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
