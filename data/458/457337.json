Sylvester McCoy flew out to join the production team to re-create his role as the Seventh Doctor and to hand over to Paul McGann.  In this behind-the-scenes video diary, Sylvester gives us a personal account of his final days as the famous Timelord. Reminiscing about the \"old days\" and drawing comparisons with the experience of working on this latest adventure, he talks to Paul McGann, Daphne Ashbrook (Dr Grace Holloway) from the new production and Anneke Wills (Polly) from the show's past.  All shot on Hi-8 camcorder.","popularity":0.6865,"poster_path":"/dnEuJ7n1IBFaQhtln1WIl4T9cZm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill and Ben Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Doctor Who is dead...
