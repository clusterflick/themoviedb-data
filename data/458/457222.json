Welcome to Betaville, the world’s most exclusive summer camp, where the world’s leaders send their children. They are the sons and daughters of presidents and kings, with supervisors to care for them and an army to protect them. Meanwhile, in outer space, Planet Z is threatened by the evil forces of Planet 38. Planet Z’s president XM (Tim Kazurinsky) launches a secret plan to trick Planet 38 into attacking Earth instead. A peace-loving emissary from Planet Z recruits the children of Betaville to warn the President (John Astin) about XM’s secret plan.","popularity":1.4933,"poster_path":"/4OuyOSyZHHlDx6psNXKPMMTu8yO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Popcorn Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It started out a picnic.
