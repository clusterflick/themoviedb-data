Going to a club with friends and having the bouncer keep you out. Having to endure jokes from classmates. These are examples of the sort of casual racism that the children of director Karin Junger and their friends have to face.  In Ik alleen in de klas, director Karin Junger, white mother of three darker-skinned children, stands with her family to confront the racism they experience in their daily lives. Twelve adolescents meet at a mansion in France. The group consists of Junger’s children and their friends. All of them come from ethnic minority backgrounds and share a feeling of being excluded from Dutch society. Re-enactment is used to explore painful situations again. In this simple but effective documentary, we can see the impact of subtle and less subtle forms of racism on the lives of young Dutch people.","popularity":0.2477,"poster_path":"/9F2UcauYvLLIXk5cmmYM3MWsbXf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55796,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Familie Film & TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me Alone in the Classroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818282,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maurice Bedaux","original_name":"Maurice Bedaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b60cac3a36840aa067d76","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185249,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Wessner","original_name":"Mark Wessner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b6083c3a3683fb606a930","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina Starke","original_name":"Sabrina Starke","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ffE7sEYbMMlNg6UeoCBk0UW8to7.jpg","credit_id":"591b610bc3a36842c10744b1","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adri Schrover","original_name":"Adri Schrover","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b6007c3a368371b063c60","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223869,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diego van Uden","original_name":"Diego van Uden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b60ab92514156f50739a7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1818287,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mylene Esmeijer","original_name":"Mylene Esmeijer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b614b925141583c070b8b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818283,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joel Sahuleka","original_name":"Joel Sahuleka","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b60df925141580d0710c2","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ranko Pauković","original_name":"Ranko Pauković","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/xUNnKLyrJUfNcyfAr15y7ARoAWH.jpg","credit_id":"591b60fdc3a3683fb606a99a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karin Junger","original_name":"Karin Junger","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b5ff2c3a36842d607488b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1818278,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jurgen Lisse","original_name":"Jurgen Lisse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b601b925141585207235c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bram Bax","original_name":"Bram Bax","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b6133925141580d07110c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9F2UcauYvLLIXk5cmmYM3MWsbXf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Dutch\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"nl\", \"native_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"May 10th 2017 at 22.55 Nederland 2","key":"VmVzPiSRlWQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-03-21T18:56:37.000Z","id":"601eab880929f60040a9b631"}]}}}
