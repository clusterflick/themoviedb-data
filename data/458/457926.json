Dr. Martin Kessler cloned his own daughter, who died from the drug. Once with ten test subjects, he and Dr Josephine Vanderhill are now left with only a few dying, sick clones, and one healthy placebo, Jenny. Daniel Powell runs the day to day operations and tends to the clones, administering the very drug that is killing them. When Dr. Kessler unexpectedly dies, instead of shutting down the facility, Dr Vanderhill wants to intensify the testing. She targets Jenny, and convinces Daniel to administer the pills in highly concentrated doses, sure to be fatal. Now conflicted, Daniel is determined to stop her and save the clones.","popularity":0.541,"poster_path":"/4qPYGjal1tndA5ISnyZdB0kLxYT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Final Cut Productions (II)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A doctor tries to save human clones from a dangerous drug trial.","title":"Kessler's Lab","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Biani","original_name":"Anna Biani","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"591b24fa925141583c06d73f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1755866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlan Godthaab","original_name":"Arlan Godthaab","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1r4ye7C3FOnWiseKnoY5MdbY233.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr Martin Kessler","credit_id":"591b251bc3a368371b060695","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Karroll","original_name":"Jon Karroll","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"News Anchor","credit_id":"591b2530c3a36842c1070f24","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1818109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda Lee","original_name":"Melinda Lee","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Josephine Vanderhill","credit_id":"591b254dc3a36842c1070f46","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Mercer","original_name":"Matt Mercer","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":"/qhNnCjYsC7K1nDQe7GQ9Qamzost.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Daniel Powell","credit_id":"591b2571c3a368371b0606ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Tate","original_name":"Mia Tate","popularity":0.2135,"profile_path":"/uBSJQStztvLMsLxmUfq3X7wJKDc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Amanda Kessler","credit_id":"591b258b92514156f50705ff","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787056,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Russell Urquhart","original_name":"Russell Urquhart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b24cd92514157230701a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1818107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Urquhart","original_name":"Brenda Urquhart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b24b3c3a3684269073617","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2112982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4omcyZ4fd4rkYCVam6f00ytf5uL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4qPYGjal1tndA5ISnyZdB0kLxYT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":670}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":402,"name":"clone"},{"id":11268,"name":"psychologist"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
