Vincenzio commutes to Rome where he's a physician and, in the hospital basement, prints an anti-Fascist paper. His brother is in the Resistance; his father supplies food to a local monastery where 12 fugitives hide. All is seen through the eyes of the oldest child, Paulo, who's about 7 and the only lad at school who doesn't wear a Fascist Youth uniform. For Paulo and his siblings, it's great fun playing with their nonno, finding herbs in the fields, watching a maid's tryst with a soldier, teasing a silent monk. Then the war reaches the farm when Italy surrenders and the Germans exact revenge.","popularity":0.3346,"poster_path":"/t72mQ5BU3c4ShVuNod3eV1NHFbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90285,"logo_path":null,"name":"General Movies sr","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1997-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La grande quercia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Большой дуб","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigio Alberti","original_name":"Gigio Alberti","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/eCvbiGXFuiW478BZwQODTuD4UNb.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Vincenzo","credit_id":"59167021925141061e02069b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariella Valentini","original_name":"Mariella Valentini","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/nck8ofrfGGarmbRJquJlTZu924H.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"59167032925141061e0206b3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":257299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Bianchini","original_name":"Paolo Bianchini","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/yV94XLDM21XqqAyD2Hb3hBnHXr0.jpg","credit_id":"59167046c3a36842c10290a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116444","wikidata_id":"Q56508217","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHsRTLQT75vCi0U0gfzGvmjxr3B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":780,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t72mQ5BU3c4ShVuNod3eV1NHFbn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":924,"name":"italian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
