Filmed in Trucolor, Stallion Canyon was the maiden effort from Kanab Productions, a Utah-based organization. Former Sons of the Pioneers vocalist Ken Curtis made his starring debut in this one, playing a ranch foreman who does his best to track down a rogue stallion. The rest of the cast is comprised of unknowns, save for villains Ted Adams and Forrest Taylor. Cheaply produced, Stallion Canyon has the twin advantages of a relatively new leading man and excellent location photography.","popularity":0.4147,"poster_path":"/eDQUr48t3gsHZJjgkHcBk5sfMlD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astor Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":90236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanab Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stallion Canyon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Curtis","original_name":"Ken Curtis","popularity":1.3421,"profile_path":"/nL4aCX6RJuuw1ML3FGWELXNiCdD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Curt Benson","credit_id":"5914ea73c3a36842d60135aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Cotton","original_name":"Carolina Cotton","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":"/tt7PncvL01ERPA9ZtRErSiJGZU6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ellen Collins","credit_id":"5914ea80c3a3683fb6011f9c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shug Fisher","original_name":"Shug Fisher","popularity":0.5026,"profile_path":"/8f6HAVTWFLT390cDwrrleKXHppA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Red","credit_id":"5914ea8ac3a3683a93012565","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forrest Taylor","original_name":"Forrest Taylor","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/11tiZFYeWNfefJccEhNU4G3cYzp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Lawson","credit_id":"5914ea9792514158520132ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Adams","original_name":"Ted Adams","popularity":0.3558,"profile_path":"/8nlghnRT63ETMDqSSAfXYlLE9N7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Wolf Norton","credit_id":"5914eaa392514156f5013408","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1631703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Hammond","original_name":"Billy Hammond","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Little Bear","credit_id":"5914eab4925141061e00afd6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Butler","original_name":"Roy Butler","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sheriff Breezy","credit_id":"5914eac8c3a3684269013df9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815157,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hy Heath","original_name":"Hy Heath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5914ea61925141583c012d25","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry L.
