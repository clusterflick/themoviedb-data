Jeff returns home from college with an engineering degree and dreams of bringing modern medical care and education to the swamps. He is immediately confronted by his old boyhood rival, \"Gator-Bait\" Blair, who thinks things are just fine the way the are. \"Gator\" whips the ignorant locals into a frenzy of fear and resistance. When Jeff is unintimidated by their threats, Blair sets out to stop his plans once and for all - with a rifle.","popularity":0.5342,"poster_path":"/2GOOIsyRgju1jlSVF4DLnZ3EXMG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danches Brothers","origin_country":""},{"id":16466,"logo_path":"/4MT9eqAB0bHzhaFVVniMaxlJ5xS.png","name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"YOU'LL GASP at the terror of the quicksand pit---the desperate struggle to escape its death-like grip!","title":"Untamed Fury","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Swamp Virgin","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Söhne der grünen Hölle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Pendleton","original_name":"Steve Pendleton","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/o8VCARJgaUxQbqs3IMKL2TC7gFE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jeff Owens","credit_id":"5917060692514159c102ff01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikel Conrad","original_name":"Mikel Conrad","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/q7Q1ViMYncOrX3uQ8WF34JluhJU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"'Gator-Bait' Blair","credit_id":"5917064d925141061e029940","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Whipper","original_name":"Leigh Whipper","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/3aDpK0wYeYrjahs02WhBWWmU8fV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Uncle Gabe","credit_id":"59170683925141583c0309d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Conwell","original_name":"Mary Conwell","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Judy Blair","credit_id":"591706cac3a3683fb602e4dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Althea Murphy","original_name":"Althea Murphy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Patricia 'Pat' Wayburn","credit_id":"591708f692514156f503239f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Rutherford","original_name":"Jack Rutherford","popularity":0.1425,"profile_path":"/7XNNoyoJwBUihJjgtg7aI2U8gDx.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Nubie Blair","credit_id":"59170932c3a36842690336f3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Keane","original_name":"Charles Keane","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Rufe Owens","credit_id":"59170959c3a368371b022487","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodman Bruce","original_name":"Rodman Bruce","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Lige","credit_id":"591709e192514156f503247e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1770750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Savage","original_name":"Paul Savage","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Swamper","credit_id":"59170a2f9251415852031c21","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.G.
