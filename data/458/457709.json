The film deals with the land reform, the founding of the Socialist Unity Party, the expropriation of war criminals, the founding of the GDR and the first Five Year Plan in July 1950. Special attention is dedicated to the setup of the steel industry. All this is shown in contrast to the new Federal Republic of Germany, where unemployment, slums and the West Berlin airlift prevail. The Cold War of those years is reflected in the film as well as a part of the development of post-war Germany.","popularity":0.144,"poster_path":"/fSLGrYMpBLoHNqDf9orInkalwcv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio f√ºr Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1950-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Weg nach oben","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hindemith","original_name":"Harry Hindemith","popularity":0.1085,"profile_path":"/k81zvSvzRYKi032iWrfWxOz1HPa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"591950abc3a36842c1055c62","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767653,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kurt Stanke","original_name":"Kurt Stanke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cd50a6c449c00530cf9b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22798,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Werner Bergmann","original_name":"Werner Bergmann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cd4fc435011003d049593","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545580,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walter Fehdmer","original_name":"Walter Fehdmer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cd5036c449c0028911626","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Thorndike","original_name":"Andrew Thorndike","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/vLvq5Ua1Jozz35Zi784w2JB8v4B.jpg","credit_id":"59194fd0c3a368371b0455a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Thorndike","original_name":"Andrew Thorndike","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/vLvq5Ua1Jozz35Zi784w2JB8v4B.jpg","credit_id":"59194fa8925141580d05381f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817067,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruno Kleberg","original_name":"Bruno Kleberg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59195067c3a36842c1055c18","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Gass","original_name":"Karl Gass","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59194fbdc3a368371b04558b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0314878","wikidata_id":"Q5261242","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.622,"height":884,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fSLGrYMpBLoHNqDf9orInkalwcv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160224,"name":"post world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
