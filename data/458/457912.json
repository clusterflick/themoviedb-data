After the collapse of the Somali government twenty years ago, its embassy in Brussels was left empty. The embassy and the sovereignty of the grounds were claimed by a group of activists who planted their own flag. This former piece of ‘Somalia’ is the only place on earth that does not belong to a country. The documentary shows how a group of people without a residence permit must live.
