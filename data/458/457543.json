Duncan stars as a dying coach trying to motivate his team to win a key game. The messages of teamwork and not giving up are made more poignant by the many real-life parallels: during filming torrential rain turned the diamond into a quagmire, and Strike Zone's teen director, himself stricken by cancer, almost died on set, before going on to compere the film's premiere.","popularity":0.0805,"poster_path":"/6cMqSinnKGiLElFbMH1zRtkY7A9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strike
