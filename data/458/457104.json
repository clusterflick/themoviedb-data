She is confronted by the physical, emotional and psychological ravages of the war, terrified and sorrowful, she cannot find her place in the city. In that quest, she communicates with everyday people, friends, neighbors, people riding the bus across the city's eastern and western flanks. To pace her journeying and dramatic unraveling of the film, Saab borrows the guise of a letter read in a voice-over, written by world-renowned poet Etel Adnan. A rare document from the civil war, Letter from Beirut lays bare and spontaneously how people make sense of their everyday in the midst of chaos, violence, terror and sorrow.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/nihdBbuALHF3TIEV9Nc2m1HW2By.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter from Beirut","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","title":"Rissalah Min Beirut","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2184168,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Olivier Guenean","original_name":"Olivier Guenean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfd2c0c0e0a263821029572","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jocelyne Saab","original_name":"Jocelyne Saab","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/3q5sBq6SVcemvaG4jMD6yTnK8X8.jpg","credit_id":"5bfd4393c3a368637002cb39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0170155","wikidata_id":"Q86666430","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5lwOSpegehKG9V4mQMdmnWYNmv8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nihdBbuALHF3TIEV9Nc2m1HW2By.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":576},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cA5v10yY2C9q9zmxj0YtPveGWwZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
