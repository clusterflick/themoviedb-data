This 'op-film' will be a disorienting and disoccidenting dérive from optical navigation to algorithms of locating – an essay against the grain of Western patterns of referencing and situating. From a film made with lenses and ensitive celluloid to the desktop locating engine, we will navigate from the material production of Fresnel lenses to the invention of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) – the tool that announces the obsolescence of the lighthouse.","popularity":0.0747,"poster_path":"/kaBqsf5ykEl7JYrVVoIUmH3cWDw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunstone","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1741263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipa César","original_name":"Filipa César","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zAEecL0Tk0taY17i50RXSDzJZuk.jpg","credit_id":"591b0685c3a3684269071b71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Henderson","original_name":"Louis Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591b0715c3a3684269071be8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1741263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipa César","original_name":"Filipa César","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zAEecL0Tk0taY17i50RXSDzJZuk.jpg","credit_id":"5bb4d59e0e0a261a1701495c","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Henderson","original_name":"Louis Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb4d5ad925141780e013ace","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Henderson","original_name":"Louis Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb4d5c30e0a261a1c01560f","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8432850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1476,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kaBqsf5ykEl7JYrVVoIUmH3cWDw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1047}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam 2018","release_date":"2018-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
