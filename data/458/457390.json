The newly arrived Linus instantly catches the warden's eye, and begins to receive secret visitations from a mysterious girl. The other boys tell Linus the legend of a special boy who fled the farm and became a glorious angel that will one day return to free them all. When Linus asks the girl if she is the angel, her answer is enigmatic. After the warden's favorite boy dies, Linus is poised to become the next victim. The girl reappears and promises to help him escape, but with hope comes punishment.","popularity":0.071,"poster_path":"/mMLtaVWh3e6KF2PLHg82sY3XOLn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiny Sumo Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":6700,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Manitoba Arts Council","origin_country":""},{"id":40259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Winnipeg Film Group","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":176657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manitoba Film & Sound Development Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soft Like Me","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Мягкий, как я","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Ducusin","original_name":"Marc Ducusin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Linus","credit_id":"59167410c3a368423c028ae4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Northcott","original_name":"Alison Northcott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Angel","credit_id":"629e16ba12197e1689f17fdc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Fast","original_name":"Rob Fast","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Warren","credit_id":"629e16cdcaa50837e5781754","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850316,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Johnston","original_name":"Anthony Johnston","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/6A4U8RXESuihigEN8zPZFipdlFq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tommy","credit_id":"629e170bcaa50837e3b18126","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Hudek","original_name":"Tim Hudek","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Georgy","credit_id":"629e17247e12f01211f7a974","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoff Thompson","original_name":"Geoff Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"629e174f85005d00acab0d2a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoff Thompson","original_name":"Geoff Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Farmhand #1","credit_id":"629e177185005d00acab0d9e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannon Bell","original_name":"Hannon Bell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Farmhand #2","credit_id":"629e1787a284eb0050a35bb3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gord Zubreki","original_name":"Gord Zubreki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Farmhand #3","credit_id":"629e17cce4c9eb0051f68197","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Basarowich","original_name":"Ian Basarowich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"629e17db5507e93225ba3524","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Bourdon","original_name":"Harrison Bourdon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"629e17e985005d0052b50101","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Mundle","original_name":"Cameron Mundle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"629e17f8e4c9eb009bc19571","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caelum Vatnsdal","original_name":"Caelum Vatnsdal","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629e19caa284eb0066947b1d","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64481,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gordon Wilding","original_name":"Gordon Wilding","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629e191ee4c9eb0066f3d27d","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578506,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"K.
