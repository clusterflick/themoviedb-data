Displaced from their home, Abu Nagham now lives in a tent in the south, fishing with his young nephew Rami, who lost his twin brother. Ahmad remains in the north, fishing amid ruins and occupation.  Once a source of livelihood and freedom, the sea has become a battleground — heavily restricted, constantly watched, and always dangerous. Through intimate footage and poetic observation, the film captures the everyday courage required to cast a net, mend a line, or share a meal. Fishing becomes an act of survival, resistance, and hope.  Co-directed by Bisan Owda (Peabody Award 2024) and Carolina Pereira, Free Fish offers a deeply personal and universal story of resilience in the face of erasure — a quiet tribute to a people who refuse to be forgotten.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qIUGzwhXQaISPleSbPdP5R9Jmge.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Displaced and divided, two brothers in Gaza return to the sea — where fishing becomes their last act of survival, resistance, and hope.","title":"Free Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4900028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bisan Owda","original_name":"Bisan Owda","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/6vPslt6uGJ4O1h3Z4utYFLFEw8f.jpg","credit_id":"691116bd1bfc2ab5fdce8979","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5807050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Pereira","original_name":"Carolina Pereira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/uAn765mV9Ta2VuETKvp6oPRyzaz.jpg","credit_id":"6911170813e44dda0cdd2145","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4900028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bisan Owda","original_name":"Bisan Owda","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/6vPslt6uGJ4O1h3Z4utYFLFEw8f.jpg","credit_id":"691118a3f12a41dda4c0602b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4900028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bisan Owda","original_name":"Bisan Owda","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/6vPslt6uGJ4O1h3Z4utYFLFEw8f.jpg","credit_id":"691118b5b82cc8c707dd22ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5807050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Pereira","original_name":"Carolina Pereira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/uAn765mV9Ta2VuETKvp6oPRyzaz.jpg","credit_id":"691118c51265c9afcad25973","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jBtbbgEwt4G23MWd5jRhY0IWIiL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1248,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qIUGzwhXQaISPleSbPdP5R9Jmge.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":832}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":836,"name":"resistance"},{"id":1495,"name":"fishing"},{"id":10349,"name":"survival"},{"id":14900,"name":"genocide"},{"id":33549,"name":"displacement"},{"id":262325,"name":"brothers"},{"id":268752,"name":"palestinian"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":275377,"name":"gaza"},{"id":339404,"name":"palestinian genocide"},{"id":354748,"name":"free palestine"},{"id":359486,"name":"israeli palestinian conflict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TRT International Documentary Awards | World Premiere","release_date":"2025-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SFFILM Doc Stories","release_date":"2025-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
