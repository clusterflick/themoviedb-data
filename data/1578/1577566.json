It is Rani, who recalls an incident fifty years earlier when she answered an email from her orphaned friend Sam to investigate strange goings on at a funfair at Danemouth. Central to the mystery is a red-faced girl named Eve, who was sent to Earth to escape a war on her home planet and is being cared for by Harry, a caretaker at the funfair. People have been disappearing and she tells Rani that they are lonely people whom she has taken so that they might have fun. She also shows Rani a vision of herself in fifty years time - as the madwoman in the attic discovered by Adam.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/xSgoh9o5GL09jCK284nYa4EtMfK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/igWZmjr5Zhbnxf7DinSOLoiggLU.png","name":"BBC Cymru
