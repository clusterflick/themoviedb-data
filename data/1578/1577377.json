From Lake Eyre to the Kimberley, the Top End to the very tip of Cape York, Monte meets a circus of characters from bona fide UFO hunters to miners who use chooks to collect gold, as he travelled through northern Australia in a bus determined to break him. This is the video of the trip, and the companion piece to the book, Through a Crooked Lens. It's the Leyland Brothers meets Norman Gunston on a quest to discover a fast-disappearing Australia.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red in the Centre: Through a Crooked Lens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
