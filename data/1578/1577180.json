Alone or with friends, these individuals combat their everyday struggles  through exercise, adopting the philosophy that mental strength comes from a foundation of  physical strength.  But what are the struggles that led them all to the gym in the first place?  We set out to interview these individuals and listen to their tales of heartbreak and loss that  drove them to adopt this nocturnal lifestyle.  With one suicide every 90 minutes in the UK and 75% of these being male, we hope this  documentary can help those struggling with their mental health to realise that they are not  alone. These men share not just their struggles but advice on how to overcome tough times in  the hopes that their words can save the next guy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eIa85yX4yr4B7hpYKuoG2ABhOsg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249112,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMD Filmmaking","origin_country":""},{"id":279821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Talk Club","origin_country":""},{"id":279822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bristol Mind","origin_country":""},{"id":279823,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changes Bristol","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Their Struggles.
