Luis from Venezuela, Jordi from Barcelona, and Prateek from northern India. Three people who each made Ireland their home in search of safety, acceptance, and renewal. Set against the landscapes of Wicklow, the Dublin Mountains, and Dublin city, the film celebrates resilience, solidarity, and self-love within Ireland’s increasingly diverse and vibrant queer community. Through their stories, the documentary reflects on migration, sexuality, gender, and health. Honouring those silenced by stigma and spotlighting the power of community to create visibility, empowerment, and change.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sO2wNuoVSBRiYeotBlVY0bKqS3T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Out of Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5806677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Noguera Benitez","original_name":"Luis Noguera Benitez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6910e8e9c00d8cc228ce89a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5806678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordi Moya Roset","original_name":"Jordi Moya Roset","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6910e8f212ca476d5add1d6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5806681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prateek Bhardwaj","original_name":"Prateek Bhardwaj","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6910e90c0d1d06c2f031b056","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4133435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pradeep Mahadeshwar","original_name":"Pradeep Mahadeshwar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6910e8afa07ed93f07dd203d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4133435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pradeep Mahadeshwar","original_name":"Pradeep Mahadeshwar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6910e8b5d903591f1cc05dd2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sO2wNuoVSBRiYeotBlVY0bKqS3T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
