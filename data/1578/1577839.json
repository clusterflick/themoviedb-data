Stories of Michigan Agriculture is a journey into the heart of Mid-Michigan's agricultural landscape-one of the most diverse in the nation. Second only to California in crop variety, Michigan's farms are as varied as the people who work them. This documentary follows the rhythm of the growing season, focusing on the individuals whose labor brings food to our tables: small family farmers, organic growers, and the often-overlooked seasonal migrant workers. Did You Guys Eat?/¿Ya comieron? goes beyond the fields and greenhouses to also highlight the support network caring for the well-being of those who help us eat. This is not just a film about farming-it is about the people, the challenges, and the unseen systems that make each meal possible.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sCmIxzApI7M9bSWyfJGnWrIt9hG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Stories of Michigan Agriculture","title":"Did You Guys Eat?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36473630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1250,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sCmIxzApI7M9bSWyfJGnWrIt9hG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":834}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
