With the intention to double down on her commitment of bringing Reaper to justice and convince the public of her ability to do so, Excelsia leaves the interview early after the reporter presses her for a comment concerning rumors of a recent gang bang. Knowing she has to ultimately defeat Reaper to avoid public disgrace, she once again engages him at his lair. She comes prepared and holds her own during the fight. Unfortunately for her, Reaper possesses a lead pipe tuned to her resonate frequency. After receiving a blow, she is disoriented enough to allow Reaper to gain the upper hand. Sadly, it's all downhill from here and Excelsia finds herself yet again on the losing end.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncovered 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5546417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayla Coyote","original_name":"Kayla Coyote","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Excelsia","credit_id":"690fef6faebdc1993d874f2a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690fef83600db1652bd25539","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690fef97c06532554ed25421","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
