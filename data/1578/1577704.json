Their contours blur under his camera’s gaze – looking not at, but into, with and through. Captured briefly along the way, gestures and textures of the world are given physical presence, where the filmmaker’s antiwar sentiment finds its echo. The title comes from an inscription found on a cottage there — a message from another time, another context: the same plea.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tf83OYf9DbHeJS5GG5cvLRj1ql.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donnez-Nous la Paix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2871947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Kostrov","original_name":"Vadim Kostrov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yz8dlX3NXhGFYdqCiV43HwFgubi.jpg","credit_id":"6910d4046cb3e5b8574c7f2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tf83OYf9DbHeJS5GG5cvLRj1ql.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"World Premiere at Eastern Neighbours Film Festival","release_date":"2025-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
