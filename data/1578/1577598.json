Mrs. Sherwood is in love with Le Roy Scott, who encounters a woman of astonishingly identical features to Mrs. Sherwood. He contrives to substitute the other woman, Marion Roche, in Mrs. Sherwood's place while he and Mrs. Sherwood escape for a tryst. But Marion is much more the wife that Sherwood dreamed of, and he falls in love \"anew\" with his \"wife,\" and she with him. She determines to find some way to permanently replace the real Mrs. Sherwood.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/uEv70CIxvPF1BjvzERjaDVzohf0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Week of Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Hans falske hustru","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La fugue d'Hélène Sherwood","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"妻となりて","type":"Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"En hustru för mycket","type":"Swedish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Frederick","original_name":"Pauline Frederick","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/oZkkaaZf07bEa3LT0YXMoGlcqSm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Sherwood / Marion Roche","credit_id":"6910a5e7f38cbda45dc05d5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Holding","original_name":"Thomas Holding","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/aHb7qbhqAz4W0hpHi7Hn8gimjFy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kingsley Sherwood","credit_id":"6910a612e24e363ff9874d6e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Ainsworth","original_name":"Sidney Ainsworth","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/cyshcbV54mF8BQF83bvAengWoku.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"LeRoy Scott","credit_id":"6910a639591b1bb437a0c69a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Barker","original_name":"Corinne Barker","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lola Canby","credit_id":"6910a6509e0edb599f874eb9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1534129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percy Challenger","original_name":"Percy Challenger","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6910a6645a6e68d567ce877d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hobart Henley","original_name":"Hobart Henley","popularity":0.1677,"profile_path":"/yse0OtdRlXTdx15QPVOzMQwkziW.jpg","credit_id":"6910a67e91326c06e2dd1ce1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cosmo Hamilton","original_name":"Cosmo Hamilton","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6910a9159d938a061f9abec4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Willard Mack","original_name":"Willard Mack","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/eXm5yWoBI7NmVwGs2GZsyMiWAT4.jpg","credit_id":"6910a927c1daa774efc05d5d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363535,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Edward Gheller","original_name":"Edward Gheller","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6910a95bdfa0d78076874d64","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010526","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1407,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uEv70CIxvPF1BjvzERjaDVzohf0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1919-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
