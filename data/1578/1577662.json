Clyde is washed up on the East Anglian coast in 1941 where he and evacuee George escape from a trio of invading Nazis using the object of Clyde's quest, an artefact known as Thor's Hammer, to activate their transmitter. Sarah Jane joins ghost-hunter Emily Morris in a haunted house in 1889, ending up in a room where voices lead them to believe that children will die in a fire in the future. Rani finds herself in the Tower of London with the imprisoned Lady Jane Grey, whom she saves from an assassination attempt with a jewelled dagger, which would appear to be what she is looking for.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/faI5kwkV2FM3KzgPSB4NYIddTYX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/igWZmjr5Zhbnxf7DinSOLoiggLU.png","name":"BBC Cymru
