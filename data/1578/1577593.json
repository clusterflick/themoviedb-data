Two of them have been in institutional care, while two have “normal” families. They are all united by shared fears and life challenges. These include not only coping with the absence of a home or, conversely, the oppressive presence of family ties, but also mental health, identity, relationships, and self-determination. They are trying to take responsibility for their lives, and with the filming comes the challenge of how much they are willing to reveal their authentic selves.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2025-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All That I'll Never Become","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4269422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Křivánek","original_name":"Filip Křivánek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6910a36c27297f2e379ac082","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
