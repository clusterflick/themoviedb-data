Not because of the party but because Oliver is wearing a skimpy outfit. Since Oliver is planning to wear it out in public, John tells Oliver to get inside so he can show him exactly how he's asking to be treated by dressing so slutty. Marcus (Dillion Diaz) is a seemingly happily married man who works with his pregnant wife, Kelly (Liz Revamped). One day, Marcus tells Kelly he has to check on a job site while she stays at the office. As soon as Marcus is at the construction site, he immediately uses a hookup app to call Jim (Pierce Paris) over. Four mechanics, Jay (Brandon Anderson), Mike (Roman Todd), Curtis (Justin Matthews), and Chris (Elliot Finn) are working late. The least outgoing of the group, Jay, is uneasy dealing with his crass and chauvinistic colleagues. He's in the closet and has fears about the guys' reactions if they find out that he's gay.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be My Bitch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
