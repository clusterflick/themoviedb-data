After trying the door, she quickly realizes she's powerless. It's not long before a voice over an intercom system greets her. The voice reminds her she is trapped but worse, a live feed appears on the wall showing a captured Redwing. It's at this moment the voice reveals the agenda. Wonderous Girl must follow every instruction and do so with a smile or Redwing will be tortured. Naturally, Wonderous Girl has no choice and immediately acquiesces to any and all demands. Unfortunately, the demands force WG into uninvited sexual scenarios. What's worse, she realizes these scenarios are far more arousing than they normally would be. She's too far gone before she realizes an injection is assisting here or that she'll regret her actions in the future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncontrolled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5805272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harper","original_name":"Harper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Wonderous Woman","credit_id":"691008b7540af423d04c7daf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69100675a5ef06b8d24c7abd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6910068ad903591f1cc05a9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
