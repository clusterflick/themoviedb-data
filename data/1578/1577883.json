Inspired by the photography series of the Romanian visual artist Geta Brătescu, the film navigates opacity and vulnerability, creating a reflective space where trauma is both embodied and mediated through artistic practice. By blending personal narrative with abstract black and white analogue photography, the work opens a dialogue about witnessing, control, and resilience, offering a meditation on the subtle violences that mark professional and intimate spaces.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/c8fDIPLgeIFEk99EczfLSESFlUp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":279929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Erosion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Towards White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5807083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Letiţia Popa","original_name":"Letiţia Popa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"691119ff47d1f03e92a0c8de","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5807081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Letiţia Popa","original_name":"Letiţia Popa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691119ee3137c7daf1874f96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5807083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Letiţia Popa","original_name":"Letiţia Popa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69111a0e2768a98e62c06015","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1358,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c8fDIPLgeIFEk99EczfLSESFlUp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
