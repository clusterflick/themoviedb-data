Each of them performs the act of meeting with herself. Person number one meets person number two, her alter ego. There rises a question: who am I? Where did I come from and where am I going to? The world comes into contact with them through music and lyrics. A path of self-awareness begins, which they also pass through catharsis on the background of various emotions, and which is saturated only with love.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Person No.2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
