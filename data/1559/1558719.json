But we, as have Ra Ra Riot's faithful, have come to appreciate this new, effervescent feel, and all it required was a live Beta Love experience. We caught Ra Ra Riot's brilliant spectacle down in Austin, Texas during Conflict of Interest's night at Hype Machine's Hype Hotel, and Beta Love skeptics beware, as our video of their entire performance can (and will) make a fan out of the most cynical synth adversary.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lQCsoWw0DgpMXuSGu57dVhI4c4I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ra Ra Riot: Live at Hype Machine's Hype Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/lQCsoWw0DgpMXuSGu57dVhI4c4I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
