The grand liners Titan and Oceania cross the Atlantic to Europe. Yet under the seemingly placid surface of the water looms the threat of submarines, “vipers of the sea”. The Oceania is torpedoed and quickly sinks.  After the dramatic intensity of the opening, however, Il siluramento dell’Oceania seems to swiftly abandon the echoes of the Lusitania and its burden of tragedy, channeling itself into the more frivolous tides of the typical adventure drama fashionable at that time, unafraid of either improbable coincidences or clichéd characters. Cecil Tryan plays the heroine, a beautiful heiress unjustly banished with her mother from her ancestral castle. She weeps at the thought of no longer being able to order seven dresses in one go from her tailor, and ultimately falls in love with the courageous captain, also a survivor, who saves her life and fortune.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Anonima Ambrosio","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1917-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Torpedoing of the Oceania","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Torpillage de l’Oceania","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecyl Tryan","original_name":"Cecyl Tryan","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jaqueline de Roccalta","credit_id":"68e3edac0ca39497d8617e5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasco Creti","original_name":"Vasco Creti","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/KcZdfbDcfuBDGjoptsRxgDvuFC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Comandante Soranzi","credit_id":"68e3edd2b683c4ec089caece","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana Leonidoff","original_name":"Ileana Leonidoff","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Viscontessa di Lagoscuro","credit_id":"68e3ee00bead25820c9cb079","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5733705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pietro Pesci","original_name":"Pietro Pesci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Visconte di Lagoscuro","credit_id":"68e3ee2e65aecc98a99cb40e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":320502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oreste Bilancia","original_name":"Oreste Bilancia","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/u92ftfIlxcaq6sgpafvyzc95X9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Barone di Mozzarella","credit_id":"68e3ee50c3f4a732bebd9c2d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfredo Boccolini","original_name":"Alfredo Boccolini","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Fedele","credit_id":"68e3ee853e2b181ccc36ec48","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Augusto Genina","original_name":"Augusto Genina","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":"/7aJfxyxkA7KjsbrHDAEWXSwTy5x.jpg","credit_id":"68e3eb23cf76b142a0c22b16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3537178,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Narciso Maffeis","original_name":"Narciso Maffeis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e3eb4d848d40f34c36ec7b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0203910","wikidata_id":"Q3795835","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/sKdy48ws6FOmTNSaijtZhSd40ZG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1917-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
