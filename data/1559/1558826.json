Alternating between the perspectives of prey and predator, we follow these unwanted creatures through a full breeding season as they become the targets of invasive data collection, then of harsh deterrence measures using the age-old art of falconry. With sound and cinematography that lets the birds speak for themselves, The Inheritors is a sensory experience which invites us to contemplate new ways of living and dying on a planet haunted by mass consumption and pollution. A foretelling of the ecologies of our future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inheritors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2272026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge-Olivier Rondeau","original_name":"Serge-Olivier Rondeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qCuFnLgcRYPeesvNrjV1kPJRhcK.jpg","credit_id":"68e57ace14ba9edbf836f2e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2272026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge-Olivier Rondeau","original_name":"Serge-Olivier Rondeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qCuFnLgcRYPeesvNrjV1kPJRhcK.jpg","credit_id":"68e57addd5133d4bf6618691","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2272026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge-Olivier Rondeau","original_name":"Serge-Olivier Rondeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qCuFnLgcRYPeesvNrjV1kPJRhcK.jpg","credit_id":"68e57ae9d715164943f823a0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1995072,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anouk Deschênes","original_name":"Anouk Deschênes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e57af4cd36ff9cabc27e1d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5736270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Samuel Gagnon-Thibodeau","original_name":"Samuel Gagnon-Thibodeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e57b02a0f27065a525c03a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4439205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean Paul Vialard","original_name":"Jean Paul Vialard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e57b1e6b00f98e91f825d8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4CiIa6ngd81He5NoclYvKWQcTTh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
