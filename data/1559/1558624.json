She learns that it’s not always easy to get recognition from your parents. We follow her journey and while growing up she develops a passion for climbing. However, her father doesn’t approve of it. His strong opinion weighs heavy on her and she carries his words with her, until it has taken over her life. She learns to overcome his negativity by realizing those words are just something her dad said and does not say anything about her worth. By accepting herself for who she is, she learns how to break free from her father’s opinion.  In this animated short full of metaphors, the gravity of the theme is combined with stylized design, bright colors and analog textures. So it will ease us into the vulnerability of what a parent-child relationship can entail.","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":"/wv9W0Ud39smTgPkU1MXsm65tJ5R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109227,"logo_path":null,"name":"HKU University of the Arts Utrecht","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dad Said","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5735488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Livia May","original_name":"Livia May","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xJsn3ClZ2tlhx6ktHDtpdV9MdCZ.jpg","credit_id":"68e51c3e2be556d05b9622b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5735525,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Livia May","original_name":"Livia May","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e521c0c10160a47fc27a76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/5qaa83q4F2LsduJuSIXsnkLAJFV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/wv9W0Ud39smTgPkU1MXsm65tJ5R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
