They are Victoria Chorale, an alumni choir led by conductor Nelson Kwei since its inception in 1988. After an 18-year hiatus, Kwei is preparing them for the world stage again, but the thrill of competing soon meets the stress of gruelling practice.  Coda chronicles the choir’s journey from a small room to their rapturous climactic performance in Tokyo. Simmering in the background are mixed emotions that prompt conversations about competition – what if they pursue growth at their own pace without the pressure of winning as validation? Amid tears and jubilation, the fate of Victoria Chorale begins to appear tenuous.
