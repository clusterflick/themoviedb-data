The band has gone from small-town favorites to big stage stars, and their recent swing through our city for four nights at both The Bowery Ballroom and The Music Hall of Williamsburg seemed the perfect time to capture their ascent. Starting off as contemporaries to bands like Vampire Weekend, Ra Ra Riot has been something of a slow burner, choosing to develop and nurture a sound rather than cashing in on one, quick aesthetic. Following the release of their polished, Chris Walla produced sophomore album The Orchard, the band now find themselves at a point of promise. The intricacies of their arrangements rival many of the so-called art-rockers, with heaps more accessibility. While The Orchard dropped hooks for heady, reverberated decorations, the ornate finish provides a complimentary side to a band still building its foundation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dAElY2nN0CuGdCoX1Ip8SCD5Jx8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ra Ra Riot: Live at the Music Hall of Williamsburg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/dAElY2nN0CuGdCoX1Ip8SCD5Jx8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
