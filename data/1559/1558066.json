In the form of a video installation with multiple series, the subjects are built on the idea of bodyless life and its different combinations. How will beings of such a distinct future life form look together, what questions or problems can emerge in their connections? The overplayed stories about these future beings are necessary for searching for maybe the most unexpected, but difficult questions in the context of the conjunction of people and artificial intelligence.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"View in the future: Collective, Happiness 100%, Ruine or shell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5733186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariia Kuzmych","original_name":"Dariia Kuzmych","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e3b4ec0306d36330c22ac2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
