Without people, we tried to show collective anxiety, isolation, and uncertainty through images and sounds alone. A city is a city because of its people; without people, it is just a place. We tried to capture this absence, searching for traces of the soul that can be felt even in empty spaces.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slobodan Prelaz – Free To Cross –","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5734179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zsolt Herczeg","original_name":"Zsolt Herczeg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e4260cfd6add34fec27832","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
