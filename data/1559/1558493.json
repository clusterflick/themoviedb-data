Raised in a prestigious european circus dynasty, Katja has dedicated her life to the art of horse performance, an intricate craft passed down through generations. Now, as her world changes and her children have rejected the circus, she is confronted with the ultimate question: How do you pass on a life’s work when there’s no one left to inherit it? As Katja retreats to her farm in rural Denmark, a young girl named Liv moves in, eager to learn the ways of the circus—but Liv wasn't born into this world. Katja must confront her own inner struggle: Can she let go of the reins and teach this young apprentice, despite the looming fear that the art she cherishes may disappear forever?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En Plads i Manegen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
