The documentary reveals deeply troubling conditions: neglect of basic care tasks, inattention to residents, inadequately followed care plans, staff shortages, unsanitary conditions, emotional distress among residents, and instances of intimidation or mistreatment.  The film aims not only to expose failings at Castlehill but to raise broader questions about care home regulation, staffing, dignity, and accountability in the care sector.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Care Home Undercover","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catriona MacPhee","original_name":"Catriona MacPhee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68e566a919f26313f29cb716","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872542,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Niall Preston","original_name":"Niall Preston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e5675ff1e6c4fd1536f197","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3508949,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gavin Hopkins","original_name":"Gavin Hopkins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e56787926f04632836eece","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3235874,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steven Donnelly","original_name":"Steven Donnelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e567c519f26313f29cb71d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506204,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clyde Wallbanks","original_name":"Clyde Wallbanks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e568779c0452f88f6186a9","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059745,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jim Allison","original_name":"Jim Allison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e5699ef54a5487f99621ac","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538643,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Mitchell","original_name":"Andrew Mitchell","popularity":1.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e569b5733e2ffce76185d9","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4765991,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kenny Parker","original_name":"Kenny Parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e569cedd68fcfd46f82630","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3504936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Anderson","original_name":"Kevin Anderson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e56a01a6d51630a5c27f78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona McAlinden","original_name":"Mona McAlinden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e56a210ea2056e89bda209","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona McAlinden","original_name":"Mona McAlinden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e56a31fd8100940ec231de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3426758,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shelley Jofre","original_name":"Shelley Jofre","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e56a49848d40f34c36f2e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093111,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Hunter","original_name":"David Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e56a71a61c881a81f82668","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1568,"name":"undercover"},{"id":3979,"name":"hidden camera"},{"id":163118,"name":"social justice"},{"id":171184,"name":"expos√©"},{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"},{"id":195240,"name":"investigative journalism"},{"id":220328,"name":"elder care"},{"id":261053,"name":"human dignity"},{"id":359991,"name":"institutional neglect"},{"id":359992,"name":"health & welfare"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
