As they face the pressure to unfailingly turn their lives into social media content, the boundaries between their personal and professional worlds become increasingly blurred.  Through careful interweaving of scenes from these four lives, the filmmakers uncover how each household navigates the delicate balance of care, responsibility and individual needs required to thrive and the human cost of such ways of life where work never leaves the comfort of your home.
