Every year, at the beginning of summer, he captures and trains the hawks, and at the start of winter, he releases them back into the wild. One of his recurring endeavors begins with training a hawk named “Andgai.”(Oath). However, laws and regulations on bird training are lacking, and the densely populated urban environment, crowded with people and buildings, is far from suitable.  Batbileg aims to revive Mongolia’s ancient falconry culture, raise public awareness of the value of falcons, and pass on conservation ideals to the younger generation. Yet, in the face of the many challenges before him, he is forced to confront a dilemma: should he comply with the law, or remain faithful to his ancestral tradition?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4MbJndVy3jTjD8Bam9dYlv6PbKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":276657,"logo_path":null,"name":"19film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"UNFORGETTABLE HERITAGE","title":"Falconry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5737048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Batbileg Erdenejargal","original_name":"Batbileg Erdenejargal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68e5e7eb5eb14e1ae689ff56","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5737050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enkhbayar Bataa","original_name":"Enkhbayar Bataa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e5e8124a702565c63d6e92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5737050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enkhbayar Bataa","original_name":"Enkhbayar Bataa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e5e8d5a03c301d8b3d6ee7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":941,"name":"tradition"},{"id":251543,"name":"heritage"},{"id":294654,"name":"falconry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
