Fanatical staff of the local history museum were hiding it from communist invaders for 90 years. During hard timesof perestroika they had to sell thi document abroad but it didn’t pass the border guard that later hung it on the WC door. And there I’ve discovered it. I had deliberately got off the train to pee because of the vomiting smell of chinese sandals and soviet clysters which I had been illegally carrying to Poland. So I read this and it touched me so deeply that I decided to tell all the world about it for people not fooling around anymore but doing something good and great.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legend of Little Russia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4399597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Semen Khramtsov","original_name":"Semen Khramtsov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e3b9a6613b5e4dfc961b77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
