Thinking wistfully of one's distant home or of loved ones far away, or yearning for a youth that can never be recaptured. Sorrow, agony, bitterness, love, beauty, radiance. Sometimes a sharp pain within one's heart. Sometimes one should aim at the light that will lead one into the future. In the outskirts of this world, surrounded by strangers, a lone man feels SAUDADE. These mindscapes blend with elements of poetic scenery, and singing and dancing to a variety of music, to display the charm of Sena Jun: the noble-mindedness of proud solitude, tender kindness, and sometimes a brief glimpse of forlorn fragility, in contrast to which her vigorous strength and dynamism overflows even more vividly.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pqpKRMEFCRJ8wLN6YOUKcB1RINt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SAUDADE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2425405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Sena","original_name":"瀬奈じゅん","popularity":0.267,"profile_path":"/p7BzfdNTbzpRXZYvTtbIi0slCCE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68e576490ca39497d86185c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uzuki Hayate","original_name":"Uzuki Hayate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fzgJbdwWA6iHRArRVgYXnw3cHDi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68e5765cc96d0af1b8c232c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3135187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"An Houzuki","original_name":"鳳月杏","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/mB0ca7dEaVosV0OFSiy3OWlnXd9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68e57665801bd820ae25c068","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koshino Ryuu","original_name":"Koshino Ryuu","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68e5766d8d5a1f22659cb674","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4826401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanase Mizuka","original_name":"Hanase Mizuka","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68e57674c7094f6d9336f0bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4128365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Touka Yurino","original_name":"Touka Yurino","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68e57687c3bb14332a36f3fb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inaba Daichi","original_name":"Inaba Daichi","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e5769b953d5a78f525c0e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inaba Daichi","original_name":"Inaba Daichi","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e5769f2be556d05b962525","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135206,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Miori Yumino","original_name":"Miori Yumino","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e576a97ed9c6f53e25c1bb","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3954696,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"ANJU","original_name":"ANJU","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e576b204adf86838f82607","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386247,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"KAZUMI-BOY","original_name":"KAZUMI-BOY","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e576ba1519358ac625c31c","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/obZXMIzthvZrKhy6eO8MAKPM97a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":930,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/pqpKRMEFCRJ8wLN6YOUKcB1RINt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":615}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"},{"id":290636,"name":"moon troupe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
