Director Ash Greyson, who was nearly aborted just months before the Roe vs Wade decision, sets out on a journey to find others like him. In the process he uncovers the divisive issues, eventually finds some common ground, and seals it all up with compelling first person stories from mothers and children who narrowly escaped abortion. While pulling no punches, he skillfully replaces rhetoric and religion with hope and heart in what may be the most approachable film ever created on the topic.","popularity":0.6921,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11606,"logo_path":null,"name":"BrightBulb Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":11607,"logo_path":null,"name":"ACLJ Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story About People Who Almost Weren't","title":"Life Happens","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Graham","original_name":"Gary Graham","popularity":0.4147,"profile_path":"/uu3S6uK3mlRyjsabMg1NADuV0Vw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5990b5e392514167230335f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Hamilton","original_name":"Scott Hamilton","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/9SiqtTxjDC2TrcBLKBh4z70IYmt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5990b626c3a36874730334e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1087299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alveda King","original_name":"Alveda King","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/2pSpld7dp4JvjsvBL5YPqM8tOFj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5990b638c3a36874730334ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Palmer","original_name":"Jim Palmer","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":"/oFaoyxX8EPY6VxBJ3pVyMezseuZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5990b645c3a36874a3033525","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1229982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Star Parker","original_name":"Star Parker","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5990b661c3a368747303351f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Richt","original_name":"Mark Richt","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5990b678925141672303367d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869143,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chad Bonham","original_name":"Chad Bonham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5990b6ae92514167590325a2","department":"Production","job":"Coordinating Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Dunlap","original_name":"Ryan Dunlap","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5990b6bdc3a368747303357c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869144,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Giesler","original_name":"Matt Giesler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5990b6d3c3a368749303030f","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869145,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jay Sekulow","original_name":"Jay Sekulow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5990b6e1c3a36874c4034ca6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297511,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Logan Sekulow","original_name":"Logan Sekulow","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5990b6f19251416739031fe9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1695791","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2393,"name":"adoption"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Life Happens - Trailer","key":"pd1qRrLVn7g","published_at":"2010-08-18T19:52:33.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6f7c3a36854480098d6"}]}}}
