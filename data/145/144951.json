Along with Sedaris, there are stories by the now-famous Tig Notaro, Glynn Washington, Ryan Knighton and David Rakoff. Lots of the stories are funny. David Rakoff's is particularly touching. He talks about the abilities heâ€™s lost during his fight with cancer, and then, gracefully, beautifully, does a solo dance onstage. It was the last story Rakoff ever wrote for the radio show. He died three months later, in August.  OK Go provides music. Monica Bill Barnes &amp; Company dance. Ira Glass tells a story using things he normally can't: photos. Mike Birbiglia casts Terry Gross in a surprising, hilarious little movie.","popularity":0.7539,"poster_path":"/2sVpmKPAXbaZKvt4HWVWfDUTNaT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This American Life Live: The Invisible Made Visible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Invisible Made Visible","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Birbiglia","original_name":"Mike Birbiglia","popularity":0.5299,"profile_path":"/cHMnptX86nuvQfpWox2uhIs0OMl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdea9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":210160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira Glass","original_name":"Ira Glass","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/eJGLNZjLW7Xn3XTkB3uXh99fWFc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdead","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tig Notaro","original_name":"Tig Notaro","popularity":0.5176,"profile_path":"/tdZ6XLzIaK0HWWPSM2B5OrOqUC0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdeb1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sedaris","original_name":"David Sedaris","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/dsKXsIhzsB6HVUCe2pucKIupHc1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdeb5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Rakoff","original_name":"David Rakoff","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/1dVXWZuZeqvv9VRritjmLb8gbP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdeb9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Dayne","original_name":"Taylor Dayne","popularity":0.3018,"profile_path":"/7E6RvfukZ1HC6QNvt9x5MMg4ywH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdebd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Gross","original_name":"Terry Gross","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/3QiZWwqPrQuXNftxcijqxL3obEe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bank Robber","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdec1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Knighton","original_name":"Ryan Knighton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdec5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":972057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glynn Washington","original_name":"Glynn Washington","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdec9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":206090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"OK Go","original_name":"OK Go","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Musical Guests","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdecd","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Bill Barnes","original_name":"Monica Bill Barnes","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fded1","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Bass","original_name":"Anna Bass","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self - Dancer","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fded5","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":210160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira Glass","original_name":"Ira Glass","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/eJGLNZjLW7Xn3XTkB3uXh99fWFc.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdedb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":286355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Stern","original_name":"David Stern","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b479251416c750fdee1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2394055","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2sVpmKPAXbaZKvt4HWVWfDUTNaT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer for This American Life -- Live!
