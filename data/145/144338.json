Whether they pulled them out of camps or took them off trains that were taking them to concentration camps, the diplomats, in the end, ensured that the Jews, who were Turkish citizens, could return to Turkey and thus be saved. Based on the testimonies of witnesses, who traveled to Istanbul to find safety, the Turkish Passport also uses written historical documents and archive footage to tell this story of rescue and bring to light the events of the time.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":"/fZUQeNfx7LrcTOxLmewMlqDgNEi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96814,"logo_path":null,"name":"Interfilm Istanbul","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2011-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"as long as good people are ready to act, evil cannot overcome.","title":"Turkish Passport","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony McKinley","original_name":"Anthony McKinley","popularity":0.1353,"profile_path":"/sI6GoYzlhCjvsOYVhoXTTSSvDYU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"SS Officer","credit_id":"59f85c65c3a368607e01293c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Barbouth","original_name":"Albert Barbouth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59f85c7492514169a10118ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Barbouth","original_name":"Albert Barbouth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nessim","credit_id":"59f85c869251416a0c0115c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosma Constantin","original_name":"Cosma Constantin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fikret","credit_id":"59f85c989251416a0c0115df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eylem Demir","original_name":"Eylem Demir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59f85ca9c3a368609301048a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120698,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Burak Arlıel","original_name":"Burak Arlıel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b2e9251416c750faf31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1914985,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alpay Göltekin","original_name":"Alpay Göltekin","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85d0792514169ec01148f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914983,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gokhan Zincir","original_name":"Gokhan Zincir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85cd292514169ec01143c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914984,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Senol Altun","original_name":"Senol Altun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85cf292514169db011540","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914982,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Deniz Yesilgun","original_name":"Deniz Yesilgun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85cc092514169a1011921","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alp Yenier","original_name":"Alp Yenier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85d1a92514169a10119b8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1951292","wikidata_id":"Q445516","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/fZUQeNfx7LrcTOxLmewMlqDgNEi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
