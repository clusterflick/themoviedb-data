He is frustrated with his career, his relationships, the world and ultimately with himself. Unable to keep from displaying his considerable disdain, he focuses on everything wrong in his life as he treads the same dissatisfying paths. When he meets the stunning and unpredictable Cassie, she invites him to let down his guard and enjoy the world around him. Nolan slowly gives in to Cassieâ€™s exuberance, but just as he begins to change his perspective, circumstances conspire to throw his already fragile psyche into turmoil. Turning even more deeply inward, Nolan attempts escape, but must ultimately face his life as he has made it.","popularity":0.1478,"poster_path":"/35yT6OR2XHpXX6LV7PWP6NGcSuj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CXL","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Gillane","original_name":"Sean Gillane","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b389251416c750fc0d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2182267","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/35yT6OR2XHpXX6LV7PWP6NGcSuj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
