Filmed at Skirball Center for Performing Arts in New York City, “Chris Hardwick: Mandroid” features candid comedy tales that cover virginity, chess club, shark vaginas, awkward childhood, awkward adulthood (which in this case is an extension of awkward childhood) and a myriad of other topics which may or may not include Quidditch. From unearthing his old MySpace page to the futility of attempting to delete his Facebook account, Hardwick displays his comical approach to all things trivial in the digital era, all while #hashtagging completely out of context.","popularity":0.6054,"poster_path":"/w0syPC0zoBdp19aJCeLhA1KjQ8H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5466,"logo_path":"/1QCiwVMHyYxLtcEd4NGvlQ7cmA4.png","name":"Irwin Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chris Hardwick: Mandroid","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chris Hardwick - Mandroid","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Hardwick","original_name":"Chris Hardwick","popularity":0.549,"profile_path":"/dKCyapNYbzeihK38YHJoEzpSUw1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b249251416c750f9a8f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298397,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"A.J.
