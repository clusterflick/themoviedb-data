CHARM is an ultra low budget black comedy about Malcolm - a New Yorker who gets tired of how gentrified, tepid and antiseptic it's all become. What's happened to the 'Good ole days'?! And so he decides to take matters into his own hands by personally starting a crime wave which he hopes will catch on and drive real estate value down, opening up the city to bohemians, artists and a swell of creativity, just like the supposed good 'ole days of the 1970s and 80s. The only problem is: Nobody is paying attention.","popularity":0.1891,"poster_path":"/pS9d7Qz5IjbOzJr1XJPNhuaUm4r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coma Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Charm: Something to offend everyone","title":"Charm","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Malcolm","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Random Acts of Violence","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Dayan","original_name":"Rebecca Dayan","popularity":0.3804,"profile_path":"/2bgSNnWjoxlQSBHsuTkQp9ygGd7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sofia","credit_id":"52fe4b469251416c750fdb29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Murray","original_name":"Jennifer Murray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"52fe4b469251416c750fdb2d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121634,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ashley Cahill","original_name":"Ashley Cahill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Malcolm","credit_id":"52fe4b469251416c750fdb31","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121634,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ashley Cahill","original_name":"Ashley Cahill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b469251416c750fdb25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121634,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ashley Cahill","original_name":"Ashley Cahill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b469251416c750fdb37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1954330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pS9d7Qz5IjbOzJr1XJPNhuaUm4r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1071}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Charm - Official Trailer","key":"4mY4J4JSmUo","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2013-08-07T13:49:38.000Z","id":"6626e603e295b401879c2600"}]}}}
