First, the camera pans the Kremlin and Marshal's Bridge. Sleds are parked in rows. Horse-drawn sleighs run up and down a busy street. Next, we visit the mushroom and fish market where common people work and shop. In Petrovsky Park are the well-to-do. Men are in great coats. A file of six or seven women ski past on a narrow lane. Last, there's a general view of Moscow. A slow pan takes us to a view above the riverfront where the film began.","popularity":0.3873,"poster_path":"/gPKBPSYKAFUFXRHEBZsjz88s1sQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moscow Clad in Snow","video":false,"vote_average":6.425,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Moszkva hóban","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Москва под снегом","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Москва в снегу","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Москва, покрытая снегом","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083434,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph-Louis Mundwiller","original_name":"Joseph-Louis Mundwiller","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b359251416c750fbab7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083434,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph-Louis Mundwiller","original_name":"Joseph-Louis Mundwiller","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fb83b87aec00341a0782","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256939","wikidata_id":"Q3324719","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Xv8FDZxF7sS5eOYu79BPvh4cgT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gPKBPSYKAFUFXRHEBZsjz88s1sQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":10794,"name":"snow"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":186450,"name":"moscow, russia"},{"id":240800,"name":"wintertime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1909-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
