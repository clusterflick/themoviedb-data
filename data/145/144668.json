The daughter, now the sole carer of her dying mother, dreams of far away places, the haunted look in her eyes loaded with a sense of what could have been. Famous Aboriginal singer, Jimmy Little, sings 'Royal Telephone', evoking the presence of Christianity and its role in the assimilation of Aboriginal people. The final scene sees the daughter lying in a foetal position next to her mother, crying. Assimilation, then, can be understood as a pain experienced by both the Aboriginal daughter as well as the white mother.","popularity":3.7739,"poster_path":"/xtduPHL6hRlR9VEsj6EY2Ua16vr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":417,"logo_path":"/w7d3hoHQaC0XwjrxEG1yPeuUhu5.png","name":"Australian Film Commission","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1990-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Cries: A Rural Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Langton","original_name":"Marcia Langton","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/4waLU03VmbK176Pq5J4WjkLAyLI.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Daughter","credit_id":"5a339dc192514103241a9f25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Hardwick","original_name":"Agnes Hardwick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Old Mother","credit_id":"5a339dc9c3a368148f023796","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1941887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Little","original_name":"Jimmy Little","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/1RpEg9kFgW7CxmwD0hrOO7wRmwz.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Singer","credit_id":"64c7a486eec5b558e9e3a4be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alkira Fitzgerald","original_name":"Alkira Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Young Daughter","credit_id":"52fe4b3e9251416c750fcaf1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Gentle","original_name":"Elizabeth Gentle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Young Mother","credit_id":"52fe4b3e9251416c750fcaf5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Wridgeway","original_name":"Liam Wridgeway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"52fe4b3e9251416c750fcaf9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Saunders","original_name":"Shaun Saunders","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"52fe4b3e9251416c750fcafd","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracey Moffatt","original_name":"Tracey Moffatt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yVHCfGmY488q8BUkJSk8VEH7otd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3e9251416c750fcae1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracey Moffatt","original_name":"Tracey Moffatt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yVHCfGmY488q8BUkJSk8VEH7otd.jpg","credit_id":"5a0193d69251415708018641","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097970","wikidata_id":"Q121811066","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rWzCC2S0U2ThfMiziilegOK9Wa6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xtduPHL6hRlR9VEsj6EY2Ua16vr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":2023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSKOjmHinFQnc0ftb1y7ZVAr4L1.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1502},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rPD1J7Bb04e7SgdhHA4bRcv0F20.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":209560,"name":"aboriginal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
