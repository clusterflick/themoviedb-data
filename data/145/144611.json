These children are constantly busy, pasting propaganda posters on walls, distributing hand bills, exhorting all to \"buy from the cooperative\" as opposed to the Public Sector, promoting temperance, and helping poor widows. Experimental portions of the film, projected in reverse, feature the un-slaughtering of a bull and the un-baking of bread.","popularity":0.4776,"poster_path":"/bhVJTDjGdKcyRIUiVYLLc1l1pB9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kultkino","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1924-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kino Eye","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":39,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Kinoglaz","type":"Latin characters"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kino Eye","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Cineocchio","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kino-Eye: Life Caught Unawares","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dziga Vertov","original_name":"Dziga Vertov","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/6CvXGGtNiF3ofSe1MFtGwgJnCVo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3c9251416c750fc757","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dziga Vertov","original_name":"Dziga Vertov","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/6CvXGGtNiF3ofSe1MFtGwgJnCVo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3c9251416c750fc75d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042437,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mikhail Kaufman","original_name":"Mikhail Kaufman","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/o2EH1WP2Qu271ToI63okSZwCzTF.jpg","credit_id":"5b7da8c9c3a368341a00292a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1057498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizaveta Svilova","original_name":"Elizaveta Svilova","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7da8d70e0a2615cf00235b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0015039","wikidata_id":"Q4220870","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztmcKGbJzPr3rbuBENhrR0FURby.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/zct6jOiUwJcJ8FD321pgdwKVXha.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bhVJTDjGdKcyRIUiVYLLc1l1pB9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6jHOhvRYvg8KurLW4HX08VlZ6kX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/2NwEHV3RKAKMTWuMOzMxCOIFo1Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":224427,"name":"soviet realism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1924-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-ray","release_date":"2015-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
