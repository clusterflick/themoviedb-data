Two are fraternal twins, the third a blue-collar worker, the fourth the privileged daughter of wealthy parents who \"needs a little dirt in her life\". The story provides penetrating insights into the Austria of the 50s, in which some enjoyed the benefits of the \"Economic Miracle\", while others were shut out. It repeatedly references Austria's Nazi past and the numerous ways in which it influences the present despite the conspiracy of silence which surrounds it.","popularity":0.1467,"poster_path":"/t0vSGv60kKTxEUNOcWAwOGVIleh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1982-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
