Four inches long, with a 12-inch wingspread, we see it walk, approach a victim, pull out a patch of fur large enough for it to engage its teeth, then lap six or seven ounces of blood. Its saliva may be an anesthetic keeping its victims from waking. A stub nose and harelip contribute to its efficiency and its hideous look.","popularity":0.2542,"poster_path":"/az478qHIo2nYAzKVms0wj4efdBE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1945-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vampire","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":38,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Schreck","original_name":"Max Schreck","popularity":0.3607,"profile_path":"/uKVNFFt6VA8R7pp7HIPJF4e5PfX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nosferatu (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4b3e9251416c750fcc1f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Painlevé","original_name":"Jean Painlevé","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/nPBl1BeNGekK6IxV4Ht6LFUmDxu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3e9251416c750fcc1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duke Ellington","original_name":"Duke Ellington","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/eeGUhNryUGMWpUupvKE61aFjzAp.jpg","credit_id":"5fe622a372d855003cc747ed","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130342","wikidata_id":"Q3228010","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ijbPYeAObKS4WMPwHIgScdntXWr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/az478qHIo2nYAzKVms0wj4efdBE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j62K4FrHLxJYIKwy4mSkfhNZc6R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
