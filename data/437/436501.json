Paule Baillargeon portrays a well-known director who returns to her home town of Montreal to film a high-budget musical drama. At her hotel, Paule has a brief but unsettling encounter with a suicidal elderly woman (Louise Marleau). This element of the plot is briefly forgotten as we get to know the actors in Paule's current project. Then she meets the old lady again, and with mounting incredulity Paule discovers that the actual events in the woman's life mirror the fictional events in the director's film.","popularity":0.3766,"poster_path":"/sDgPaPWN1kYVKgVnTHHXIhrYiIT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6932,"logo_path":"/xuT1llv85XnO6meLPAWKd5zMPFM.png","name":"ACPAV","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A
