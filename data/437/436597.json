The Titanic sank in April 1912, and her sister ship, the Britannic, ultimately suffered the fate, sinking in 1916 due to an explosion caused by an underwater mine.  In the wake of the Titanic disaster, Britannic was re-engineered to be even stronger. And yet she sank in just 55 minutes - three times faster than Titanic. It's one of Britain's greatest untold disaster stories. Now on the 100th anniversary, presenters Kate Humble and Andy Torbet piece together exactly what happened in those 55 minutes.  While Andy makes a dangerous dive to the wreck, Kate speaks to descendants of the survivors. The characters she uncovers include Violet 'Miss Unsinkable' Jessops, who survived both Titanic and Britannic, Captain 'Iceberg Charlie' Bartlett and lookout Archie Jewell, who miraculously survived while those around him died.","popularity":1.1555,"poster_path":"/eEnyYVdiCtIxnevt3I2noJB6gs7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Titanic's Tragic Twin: The Britannic Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":216257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Humble","original_name":"Kate Humble","popularity":0.2694,"profile_path":"/gJUyHFl9rTyeU2yAATdDG93U2Ey.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself - Presenter","credit_id":"58848c94925141045d019d7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Torbet","original_name":"Andy Torbet","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Presenter","credit_id":"58848ca4c3a368063901a19b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":576104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renny Bartlett","original_name":"Renny Bartlett","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58848cc3925141045b019b0d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743440,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justin Binding","original_name":"Justin Binding","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58848d65c3a368063c0195ad","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":576104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renny Bartlett","original_name":"Renny Bartlett","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58848cddc3a368065001ab85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":576104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renny Bartlett","original_name":"Renny Bartlett","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58848cd09251410457018d8c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743439,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Parkins","original_name":"Emma Parkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58848d28c3a368063c019566","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1095425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diene Petterle","original_name":"Diene Petterle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58848d4dc3a3684f3a015c62","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3046823,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Zanders","original_name":"Paul Zanders","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676366cb178bde9bac4a39f2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7140714","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqkQRtRu8fslxl9IfmRP5k5PVIR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5BeAczlS2wnP8KirAZgcj7jUdQO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v41f2s501QjzBTm62DZMAi6ZDj8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2162,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eEnyYVdiCtIxnevt3I2noJB6gs7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1442}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4388,"name":"titanic"},{"id":180100,"name":"sinking ship"},{"id":231892,"name":"britannic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC One NI Only","release_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2016-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
