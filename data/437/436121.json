And another with a penchant for rubber… Discover the wonderful world of dogs… barkers, bullies, crappers, and roamers. Meet Boris, Pebbles, Piglet, Molly and the delinquent dog, Fugly. Meet the people – the devoted dog-lovers and those less enthusiastic about the canine breed. The Wonderful World of Dogs looks at the myths and obsessions surrounding the domestic dog and their doting owners.
