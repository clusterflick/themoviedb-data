But then he gets to know the much younger Irene and forgets all about his dead wife, marrying the young tart soon after.  Irene moves into the house in the mountains, where Ferdinand, his son Heinz and his former mother-in-law Mrs. Leuthoff live.  The bitter Mrs. Leuthoff makes life difficult for Irene, since she had no way of preventing Ferdinand from re-marrying after her daughter bit the dust.  When Ferdinand conveniently goes out on tour once again, Irene has to sit at home with the bitter woman.  One day, Irene’s cousin Gustl comes on a visit and Mrs. Leuthoff takes the opportunity to “accidentally” let slip to Ferdinand, that his current wife is a whore.  As if living with your current mother-in-law isn’t enough to deal with!","popularity":0.2132,"poster_path":"/meimcCUzhWUEnR3Anlc6G6oMkw0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Forst-Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1937-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serenade","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1025520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilde Krahl","original_name":"Hilde Krahl","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":"/iMxnBJ9IyxWDWqOPz9j1mmB3uiN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Irene -
