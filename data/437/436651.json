Instead it's a sort of Reform School Western about a couple of wayward Chicago boys (Billy Cummings and Freddie Chapman) taken in by Ryder's indomitable aunt, \"The Duchess\" (Alice Fleming.) The boys escaped their very own \"Fagin,\" Bull Reagan (Roy Barcroft), and were given a second chance on the lady's Western ranch. Unfortunately, Reagan returns to do a bit of cattle rustling, once again luring the boys into becoming his accomplices.","popularity":0.7989,"poster_path":"/izugQBSPsey4CDaApfSHJMSPdvo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"JUSTICE RIDES THE PLAINS!","title":"Colorado Pioneers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Elliott","original_name":"Bill Elliott","popularity":0.2801,"profile_path":"/9Wafomp8j5p0CWnRXJWt6OlAg0m.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Red Ryder (as Wild Bill Elliott)","credit_id":"58850eb2c3a368064a01eb63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Blake","original_name":"Robert Blake","popularity":0.4859,"profile_path":"/gxhVHS4qhVp1xJiCy9s08ltIiPu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Little Beaver (as Bobby Blake)","credit_id":"58850ec1c3a368064a01eb6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":567220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Fleming","original_name":"Alice Fleming","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/o2isShAUA8Re3R49T8sdBMIsy7Z.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Duchess","credit_id":"58850ed0c3a3684ec602030c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Barcroft","original_name":"Roy Barcroft","popularity":0.3467,"profile_path":"/57EKCVAOfcNKNNcHBtkmp0cU9od.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bull Reagan","credit_id":"58850ee09251410454022a86","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Geary","original_name":"Bud Geary","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/5jaWUWlNPikCWyrUVO8wCSNPu90.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Henchman Bill Slade","credit_id":"58850eef925141044c022777","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1743711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Cummings","original_name":"Billy Cummings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Joe, Parish Boy","credit_id":"58850f009251410451021489","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1594346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Chapman","original_name":"Freddie Chapman","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Skinny, Parish Boy","credit_id":"58850f0e9251413edb01f623","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Jaquet","original_name":"Frank Jaquet","popularity":0.2598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dave Wyatt","credit_id":"58850f1cc3a368064a01ebd8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom London","original_name":"Tom London","popularity":0.2025,"profile_path":"/nfLW8J3AMasTu1Ahm0HftRgx9qy.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sand Snipe","credit_id":"58850f2b9251410460023759","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Hale","original_name":"Monte Hale","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":"/lnWpg7Ds1WsHhzt7QLpvBJXaUo4.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Cowhand That Quits","credit_id":"58850f40925141045702106f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Thomas","original_name":"Billie Thomas","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/w7atHOoODZe0u7aRNe3Dci6mNvq.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Smokey, Parish Boy (as Buckwheat Thomas)","credit_id":"58850f519251410454022b18","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Hank Disher","credit_id":"58850f62c3a368064a01ec37","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmett Vogan","original_name":"Emmett Vogan","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gKDRfOG9zZ5lOrNceUSIDI4ZbUh.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Judge","credit_id":"58850f7392514104600237b0","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Chatterton","original_name":"Tom Chatterton","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/wVqT4BBuBbe8TjgS91l1MgI0za4.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Father Marion","credit_id":"58850f829251410454022b53","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.G.
