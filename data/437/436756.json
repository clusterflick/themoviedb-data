When the couple’s views towards the agreement move in opposite directions, cultural differences and expectations become pronounced. Casting an ironic eye on the Los Angeles lifestyle and art scene of the early 1980s, this stylised narrative asserts that the delirium of Hollywood ‘reality’ has a manipulative impact on personal relationships.","popularity":0.0642,"poster_path":"/uz58UadxIwuv29zmJ8EduwYE2tB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43704,"logo_path":null,"name":"KYO-DAI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green
