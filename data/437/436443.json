Chim Kei meets an enigmatic woman named Mimi Wong who introduces herself as the daughter of an upper-crust family. But the infatuated writer is struck by a spasm of sorrow when he later sees Mimi make her appearance as a taxi-dancer at a party. The lovers are reconciled by the story of her plight told by her sister Annie. However, Mimi goes missing on the engagement day. By a stroke of luck, Chim runs into the elusive woman again and finds out how she was forced into prostitution by her drug-addict husband, his childhood best friend and benefactor Chan Hung-kit. Chim leaves dejectedly, and has since been idling his days away. The frail Mimi confesses her love for Chim on her deathbed, and from not far away, Chan has ended his own life.","popularity":0.8686,"poster_path":"/bYXBZEt0ghr3xiTA4FNESKgVf3A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tse Brothers Motion Picture

expounding on thoughts or issues, and more competent at handling simple small subjects than complex large themes. Take 'Winter Love' as an example. Although it is just a light romantic interlude, Chor Yuen makes an unconventional variation on a popular, melodramatic theme through clean-cut scene breaks and sophisticated treatment, creating a certain unique flavour that is light years away from the straightforward narrative of his socio-familial melodramatic tragedies. Perhaps the film appears refreshing because both the scriptwriting (including the use of flashback, frequent give-and-take among characters, a preference for stillness over movement) and cinematography (black and white, location shooting) are quite extraordinary by current Chinese film standards.
