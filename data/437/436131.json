The cartographer Samuel Feijóo decided to discover the mythical island and for this reason he settled in the middle of the country and regularly published a travel book that looked like a magazine, narrating his own travels through the mythological universe of folk culture. Twenty four years later, a young man wishes to redraw the trip following the trail left by Feijóo in \"Signos\", in such a manner that the trip through the magazine displays on the screen the mythical world of Feijóo, his life and his inclusion in folk culture.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La isla y los signos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742221,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raydel Araoz","original_name":"Raydel Araoz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5881ba75c3a36814670088fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742221,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raydel Araoz","original_name":"Raydel Araoz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588365f19251410451009015","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743007,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Octavio Crespo","original_name":"Octavio Crespo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58836612c3a3684ec60077f1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1679715,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ernesto Calzado Yanes","original_name":"Ernesto Calzado Yanes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588366289251410457008f86","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743009,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Peralta","original_name":"Denis Peralta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58836642c3a368063c00901d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4706344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
