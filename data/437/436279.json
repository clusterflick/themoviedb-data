No matter how beautifully he recites Hungarian poetry, Wilson, a political refugee in his late fifties, fails the exams for the umpteenth time, because he doesn’t know where the periodical ‘Magyar Közlöny’ got its name from, and what the Corvinae are. Moreover, inspired by Vörösmarty’s poem, the committee chairman even questions his reasons for leaving his mother country. Wilson argues that his reasons include his fellow citizens cutting pregnant women in half, yet he doesn’t manage to soften the heart of the committee members.","popularity":0.2477,"poster_path":"/ySlOrp7j6vWNm8HOjSge2NgDPRe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2017-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Citizen","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cake-Baly Marcelo","original_name":"Cake-Baly Marcelo","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"601626cd8a88b200459a0162","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2405278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ágnes Máhr","original_name":"Ágnes Máhr","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"601626f13e09f3003d42b6d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arghavan Shekari","original_name":"Arghavan Shekari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"601626f8ed96bc0041fbe060","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tünde Szalontay","original_name":"Tünde Szalontay","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":"/yYfL2rvuDWrHthNsmx31pY7XLk8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"601626fed96c3c00410ec52c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gergõ Kocsis","original_name":"Gergõ Kocsis","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60162703d96c3c00410ec538","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":993511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"István Znamenák","original_name":"István Znamenák","popularity":0.2162,"profile_path":"/4seRKiTJNcwCjaS3hxQwPt8yrxx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60162709d7cd06003f06cc43","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Vranik","original_name":"Roland Vranik","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589d158b9251412cd2000b69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353779,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iván Szabó","original_name":"Iván Szabó","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6016271c7f0540003dc849cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1409879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lili Makk","original_name":"Lili Makk","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6016272e1511aa004154b61a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Vranik","original_name":"Roland Vranik","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60162713dd731b003e5860df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458446,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Imre Juhász","original_name":"Imre Juhász","popularity":0.1211,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601627273e09f3003f41bcbe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4524678","wikidata_id":"Q28537276","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ymIaJboWifQl7iVfN55TqCmNk8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/eR7GuRgJVQU9RgKFqoftJ7bfuBz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ySlOrp7j6vWNm8HOjSge2NgDPRe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cb7T1qxqq637lgpEIfU49R4zvv7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/j1vS1iHp0uoUFY7IPD3LMMcydtp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Europe on Screen","release_date":"2018-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"4sVckmo3B10","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-07-11T16:49:05.000Z","id":"6321ecdbf14dad00828818eb"}]}}}
