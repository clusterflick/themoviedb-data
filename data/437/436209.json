Precocious, silly, and friendly with everyone she meets, this energetic girl can’t seem to keep herself out of trouble.  Bear is a warm, fatherly figure that does his best to guide his friend and keep her from harm, often ending up the unintended victim of her misadventures. Though he enjoys his quiet time alone, he misses those moments when Masha is not around.  Together with a rag-tag group of friendly animals that have made the forest their home, Masha and the Bear entertains adults and children alike, teaching viewers about creativity, loyalty and true friendship.","popularity":0.5025,"poster_path":"/sgaEowGZU9QVqEqstTVoPAgDdBA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Анимаккорд","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masha and the Bear - To the Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":9.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","title":"Masha y el Oso - Al Cinema","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Маша и медведь","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Kutnevich","original_name":"Boris Kutnevich","popularity":0.3703,"profile_path":"/5nHoDcfq7A2wEqs1EYURmnHfKye.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Medved","credit_id":"59401918c3a36803b4011be3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1257267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alina Kukushkina","original_name":"Alina Kukushkina","popularity":0.2839,"profile_path":"/cXzLQltWkm8seosffGCZ9EdCvDv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Masha","credit_id":"65c3ef8fe267de017dbcd782","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduard Nazarov","original_name":"Эдуард Назаров","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/iWdkjQGOKnTvAdT738EKr8erFdu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ded Moroz","credit_id":"65c3efad8c0a48018486a606","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2823926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Varvara Sarantseva","original_name":"Varvara Sarantseva","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":"/uAJbYEWHL4kampEHBSIN2eDb98q.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Masha","credit_id":"65c3efc78c0a48018486a61b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Kuzovkov","original_name":"Oleg Kuzovkov","popularity":0.4008,"profile_path":"/QL9m69HnwyGyTB0rhZWqpfzEkZ.jpg","credit_id":"65c3ef76c15f890163f563fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1733206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Kuzovkov","original_name":"Oleg Kuzovkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5882176ac3a368146700d687","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oDeud0cAiLeq0rNsZ3BBVo0lhh4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":885,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sgaEowGZU9QVqEqstTVoPAgDdBA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
