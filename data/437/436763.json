In the late 1920s Hansen was forced to leave Germany. The multi-talented entertainer lost his audience and was never again to be seen on a German stage. His children and many others who were part of his life tell their side of the story about the tragicomic life of the popular artist.","popularity":0.3907,"poster_path":"/cssZThPFPZMLXnU9PwAKtlcb0oE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War’n
