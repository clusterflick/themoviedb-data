To the accompaniment of the abrupt sonic interjections of Fluxus-affiliated composer Takehisa Kosugi, Yalkut's black and white film records brief, masked actions: an arm with clenching fist; a pair of faces, visible only about the eyes, which squint, gaze, and rest; Paik eating a slice of bread. Reminiscent of Beckett's theater, as well as the minimal movements of 1960s avant-garde dance, Cin√©ma Metaphysique is a study in gesture and stillness, noise and silence.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/2sOEOpw1u4O7iM1PFFsyz21pdGn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema Metaphysique No. 1-5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takehisa Kosugi","original_name":"Takehisa Kosugi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588ab19fc3a368413b021565","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"58857881c3a3684d630013de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jud Yalkut","original_name":"Jud Yalkut","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/10iNajtnvaDpI7HiCmv704Fmq1S.jpg","credit_id":"5885789b925141322a0014cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2sOEOpw1u4O7iM1PFFsyz21pdGn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
