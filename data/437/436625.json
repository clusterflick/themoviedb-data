There he meets his father as a young man, when he was a member of the Special Forces. As they go through combat together, the son gets to know his father in a way he never has, giving him insight and compassion, and he is able to let go of lifelong feelings of abandonment, resentment and anger. This leads to forgiveness and a real-life reconciliation, which drives home the underlying message of this film restoring the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers.","popularity":0.7064,"poster_path":"/mqnLOZTT3NJpENcrrb7vAXViI91.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sterkinekor Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2016-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The truth will set you free","title":"My Father's War","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stian Bam","original_name":"Stian Bam","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/hVSBzX7XyO6CyvIG18hUydEbIQz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Dawid Smit","credit_id":"5884b2f0c3a368063c01b836","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin van der Walt","original_name":"Edwin van der Walt","popularity":0.3239,"profile_path":"/VRc74qZTTfz7OVP5zYA1rTQXQP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Benjamin 'Dap' Smit","credit_id":"5884b30c925141045701b065","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1040321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erica Wessels","original_name":"Erica Wessels","popularity":0.406,"profile_path":"/scIlELQZva1EoPCT4JnYOYf7JbM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karina Smit","credit_id":"5884b3289251413edb0195f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1743481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fumani Shilubana","original_name":"Fumani Shilubana","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/ilROHJrLHvjeV07YE3LSBBgOQuD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Floyd Mabela","credit_id":"5884b371925141045d01c281","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":568802,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Marais","original_name":"Tom Marais","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638087c0514c4a008788ed66","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203570,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benjamin Willem","original_name":"Benjamin Willem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bkAZ2zvDNAr3LpucB4riratABUF.jpg","credit_id":"5884bc67925141045b01c78b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Gardner","original_name":"Craig Gardner","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5884bbf9c3a368063c01c0b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Myron Lee Nash","original_name":"Myron Lee Nash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5884bc4bc3a3684f3a0183e3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lamberti","original_name":"Peter Lamberti","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/ciZi1ZYejq504rPLCuGdrf2hN2O.jpg","credit_id":"5f21c033df857c0038d52f43","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4605816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxQsWZe53grqUu7GAB8L84uz3uo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l3HDvI7fqLiDyhfDEfgFzRSttBb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/mqnLOZTT3NJpENcrrb7vAXViI91.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qptZDAtciZnCoyOfh7kYlZdgrdC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1566,"name":"dreams"},{"id":163976,"name":"reconciliation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"af","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Father’s War – Behind the Scenes:  Practical & VFX","key":"t4pusgFnPE8","published_at":"2016-07-19T13:00:33.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"5884b52ec3a368063c01ba33"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Fathers War [Amptelike Lokprent]","key":"1qvfCPYf_yc","published_at":"2016-06-03T10:30:48.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5884b4f5c3a3684ec601a7ad"}]}}}
