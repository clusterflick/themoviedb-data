Racing across five time zones, the 14-strong British and Irish crew of ?La Mondiale? compete around the clock, chasing a daunting world record set by an elite team of French legionnaires over fifteen years ago. Leaving from Gran Canaria off the coast of Africa and rowing for over a month in conditions that quickly descend into a surreal recreation of forced labor, the crew make for the Caribbean state of Barbados and a place in the history books.","popularity":0.0835,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ocean's 14","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Kershaw","original_name":"Stuart Kershaw","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5881e2f2c3a368144300ab70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3158382","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
