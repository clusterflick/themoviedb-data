It goes on board the boats that work off the coast of Broome, Western Australia, from March to December each year. Crewed mainly by Aboriginal, Malay and Chinese men, they work six days a week from sun up to sun downâ€”replenished occasionally by supply boats that also take away their hauls of pearl shell. The film captures the atmosphere, the detail and the danger involved in the search for shell as the divers in huge metal helmets and layers of clothing under their suits dive two at a time, each with one person tending their airhose and another their lifeline.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":"/oNEbOIpQII8CAIEztMiJbv2QXjq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian National Film Board","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1949-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pearlers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2592588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Bagnall","original_name":"Frank Bagnall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b57f37899da2006f070321","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Rogers","original_name":"Jack Rogers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b57f49a61de10057a28eb7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3110262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dulcie Holland","original_name":"Dulcie Holland","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/AfBfDNWdwfAyTuIPwI7qpdOSsCu.jpg","credit_id":"60b57f5850f7ca0058acfa87","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stanley Hawes","original_name":"Stanley Hawes","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/1Eo0X3Pp7szHewOPWgCUPAjdKjN.jpg","credit_id":"60b57f7a4350110078c5df2c","department":"Crew","job":"Supervisor of Production Resources"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110264,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Kennedy","original_name":"Don Kennedy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b57f916dea3a006f6e5c28","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110267,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Anderson","original_name":"Alan Anderson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b57fa1c740d90079da222d","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Robinson","original_name":"Lee Robinson","popularity":0.166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588216a6c3a368147000dfc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1816684","wikidata_id":"Q7756447","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oNEbOIpQII8CAIEztMiJbv2QXjq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Pearlers","key":"K2ShP_Aoh3I","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-08-13T04:07:17.000Z","id":"60b57fcd435011003f8372f5"}]}}}
