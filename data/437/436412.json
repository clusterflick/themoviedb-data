Harris, as a child of five, sits underneath his house amongst the cobwebs making 'sugar' by pounding sandstone rocks into fine grains and wrapping them into bags. Harris at 17 falls in love with Helen and when a tragic accident leads to a breakdown he ends up at 'The Cottage'... Thrust up against the lives of other innocent victims, Harris begins to make sense of his own guilt, grief and the secret of his past.","popularity":1.2616,"poster_path":"/59M3RJLOplDkLijMIpG0lrAIsMi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
