Knowing only Harald moved to Greece, Krüger takes his pétanque (bowling) pub buddies Ecki and Bernd along to Hellas, a country they know nor trust. Equipped only with an old photograph, they find themselves on the wrong island, upsetting the wrong shopkeeper's family. Having crossed to the right one, they wander into a tempting German free sex commune, before even learning Harald is now an orthodox monk in a monastery, which observes lent silence, albeit without fasting. The clergyman won't consider returning until Paul calls in unenthusiastic help, and even then the monk isn't on their plane back.","popularity":0.2523,"poster_path":"/kYZcnQ5ZG0bBnuXsHbtipTtc0Qx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51311,"logo_path":null,"name":"Provobis Gesellschaft für Film und
