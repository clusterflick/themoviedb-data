Journeying to six US cities, the film opens the viewer's eyes to what's happening down the street \"in plain sight\". Through engaging interviews with numerous victims of sex trafficking, the force, coercion, and deception of the children and women becomes apparent. In the midst of the darkness, stories of hope and freedom emerge as each survivor shares how she was impacted through the work of a sex trafficking aftercare home.","popularity":0.3161,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Awaken Media","origin_country":""},{"id":256472,"logo_path":null,"name":"8TRACKstudios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Plain Sight: Stories of Hope and Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Grant","original_name":"Natalie Grant","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":"/dSsX1Wf4Ng8J9hfKYhXHPAKWFit.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58813b0ec3a368147d00296e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Trotter","original_name":"David Trotter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5881399dc3a3681449002c7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ran Jackson","original_name":"Ran Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813a399251413028002c02","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099387,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Troy Lamberth","original_name":"Troy Lamberth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588139bc9251413028002bbe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Trotter","original_name":"David Trotter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588139c9c3a3681443002a6a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742032,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dirk Dallas","original_name":"Dirk Dallas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813a8f925141302b002d29","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Effects Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099387,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Troy Lamberth","original_name":"Troy Lamberth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588139f0c3a3681443002a7f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Mackenzie","original_name":"Daniel Mackenzie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813a50c3a368145b002cbc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Trotter","original_name":"David Trotter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813a00925141303a002c8d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Grant","original_name":"Natalie Grant","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":"/dSsX1Wf4Ng8J9hfKYhXHPAKWFit.jpg","credit_id":"588139d79251413028002bcf","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742031,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Austin Thompson","original_name":"Austin Thompson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813a789251413028002c19","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742033,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Matthew Cook","original_name":"Matthew Cook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813ab0c3a3681460002caf","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Lamberth","original_name":"Noah Lamberth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813988c3a3681460002bfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Lamberth","original_name":"Noah Lamberth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58813a5f925141303a002cc4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3994040","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6019,"name":"human trafficking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
