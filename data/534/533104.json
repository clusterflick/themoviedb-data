One day, in the studio, she happened to hear a colleague actor who, back from the front, tells about the brutalities suffered by the civilians in the occupied territories. At night, still troubled by that story, Bertini falls asleep and dreams: in her dream she plays the role of Mariute, a young Friulian countrywoman, mother of three kids waiting for her husband homecoming from the frontline. One day, while she is going to the well for water, she is assaulted and molested by three enemy soldiers. Her father-in-law will avenge her. In the meantime Bertini, waking up with a start, will arrive to work on time and she will end the film inviting the public to put their savings into the war bonds.","popularity":0.1283,"poster_path":"/4LOez9Wly4ZjuKoT0QBCQ4hYyL6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1918-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariute","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Bertini","original_name":"Francesca Bertini","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/jBLc6MVqk5u8i9lcSDbGwwz1SyF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63f6107b9bcd0f0083165d88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Albertini","original_name":"Alberto Albertini","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63f6109425b955008ffdef7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camillo De Riso","original_name":"Camillo De Riso","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63f610b38c22c000965ac95d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Livio Pavanelli","original_name":"Livio Pavanelli","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/6kJCcrZOU978zYAoVCBTt2WdHs5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63f6122c25b95500dd94248d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Serena","original_name":"Gustavo Serena","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63f612467dfda600b5315bfb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert de Flers","original_name":"Robert de Flers","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f610db9bcd0f00cc5f6d77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Bertini","original_name":"Francesca Bertini","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/jBLc6MVqk5u8i9lcSDbGwwz1SyF.jpg","credit_id":"63f610ff25b9550097c92605","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908321,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giuseppe Filippa","original_name":"Giuseppe Filippa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6112cfc31d30089c9e18d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666363,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alfredo Manzi","original_name":"Alfredo Manzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f611a2fc31d3007c4c394f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2075935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edoardo Bencivenga","original_name":"Edoardo Bencivenga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kJtufNznk2ubtkhgkAMya2v3wWD.jpg","credit_id":"5b3886699251415e88001e28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0184717","wikidata_id":"Q21646696","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":734,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uoPOYgTwhqyYgJHfDiYwe19HC8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1304}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4LOez9Wly4ZjuKoT0QBCQ4hYyL6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":576},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":892,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qiLyAj0r3jbFwJCKSUJSB2xA4iU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":626},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fkNWDoOmBE2sUpHRdechmdA9xJK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
