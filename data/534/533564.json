When I was a child, there was a book I always used to read when I went to the hospital. One day as I was reading it as I always did, suddenly the ending had changed. Sometime later, when I read it again, it had returned to normal.  —  In our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality. This impression is at the core of “KiyaKiya” and the related painting and drawing series.  —","popularity":0.0914,"poster_path":"/rEmCg9pgN2PPSsLkAADrrP3Kl35.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KiyaKiya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2077450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akino Kondoh","original_name":"Akino Kondoh","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3b8f76c3a36845b8017a96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013860,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Zorn","original_name":"John Zorn","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/ob7GSs2RWomOzFgrK0o8e2jOxAJ.jpg","credit_id":"5b3b8fae0e0a2640020578d6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rEmCg9pgN2PPSsLkAADrrP3Kl35.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":722}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
