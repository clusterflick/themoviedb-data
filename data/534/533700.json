But Isabelle is not the mentally balanced young lady she seems to be. In fact she is doubly traumatized, firstly by the rape she suffered eight years before from a Nazi officer and secondly by the suicide of her father shortly after. What she wants deep inside herself is to find a man, young or less young, who will bring her tenderness and happiness. Will Luc, a young German, or Monsieur Vaudois, her married boss, give her what she lacks ?","popularity":0.2742,"poster_path":"/3JVsQMhRw3aQLjKZebxaUR37Xps.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isabelle and Lust","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anicée Alvina","original_name":"Anicée Alvina","popularity":0.3698,"profile_path":"/igmx8aLKCpF1aVyg7rLu4vh2bQu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Isabelle","credit_id":"64a891519c97bd00ff19edae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Rochefort","original_name":"Jean Rochefort","popularity":0.5365,"profile_path":"/wyvdO0ih9mwLE3UHCy8GudqnKTK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"M.
