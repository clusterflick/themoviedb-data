The story is told in flashback and chronicles the woman's romantic exploits with men. Though she was involved with many men, only one really touched her heart. He was a bartender who was tragically shot and killed during an attempted robbery. She later marries and has a daughter. Unfortunately she alienates herself from her daughter when she has an affair with her daughter's fiance. Her remorse is short lived. The film jumps back to the present with the woman leaving the casino on the arm of a handsome millionaire.","popularity":0.5817,"poster_path":"/coFnE0pF5HSe6lJRBThHdczDMd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Amazing how a woman can rise in the world when she puts her mind to it...AND HER BODY!","title":"How to Make a French Dish","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Girardot","original_name":"Annie Girardot","popularity":0.7362,"profile_path":"/2njhI92RBGwQgGhGFDA9wgdGDo9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marie / Marinette / Maryse / Marie-Paule young","credit_id":"5bf2db449251415ccc07d348","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Bell","original_name":"Marie Bell","popularity":0.1414,"profile_path":"/hp8eQUXm8vGyLSwUgdRDLnifRWk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Elderly Marie-Paule","credit_id":"5bf2db4b9251415cc107d6ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Blain","original_name":"Gérard Blain","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/pPYuPqx8NrieLkNpZhUKej5s3tx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The painter","credit_id":"5bf2db4f0e0a26265c0879f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Blier","original_name":"Bernard Blier","popularity":0.7069,"profile_path":"/6xRHGb7CNDa83rcTzCp3LeIvU2s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Joseph","credit_id":"5bf2db61c3a36863750169cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Claude Brialy","original_name":"Jean-Claude Brialy","popularity":0.4074,"profile_path":"/8eAz3iwsHLWRstqasUxdd8KnuPR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jacquot","credit_id":"5bf2db650e0a2639d6016d30","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanchette Brunoy","original_name":"Blanchette Brunoy","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/tbiCjvdzuYRRnxWu3GK1vw6QSJk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Angèle","credit_id":"5bf2db6f9251417c1d014d5a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Dauphin","original_name":"Claude Dauphin","popularity":0.2269,"profile_path":"/1Phmm4zdV1gX3R3Gbjz5W4m2DBq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Oscar","credit_id":"5bf2db78c3a36838ab015eec","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":178017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sacha Distel","original_name":"Sacha Distel","popularity":0.1994,"profile_path":"/32rB3qfcH7KyJ5aq0c1hOgBSviB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Roger","credit_id":"5bf2db83c3a368189f0889db","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gélin","original_name":"Daniel Gélin","popularity":0.293,"profile_path":"/i5zZUU4IhqmJ8EZtbBy2hDRrAyl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Raymond","credit_id":"5bf2db8a0e0a264f6e01af78","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Grey","original_name":"Denise Grey","popularity":0.2533,"profile_path":"/hX2Xxz2Y4Ggf2bMb3wOZJlfGScx.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Boudard mother","credit_id":"5bf2db960e0a26266f082490","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Marken","original_name":"Jane Marken","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/f66OSgNKU4PuCtyBEFdZ4niNicD.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Alphonse","credit_id":"5bf2db9a0e0a261ac2015444","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Marquand","original_name":"Christian Marquand","popularity":0.3881,"profile_path":"/sDmro3JOBKUHBkC08UVhjNpBugR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lucien Volard","credit_id":"5bf2dba49251415cdd07ae45","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Marten","original_name":"Félix Marten","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/wQOTVGJDHa4YuKUEyM3agug103h.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Odilon","credit_id":"5bf2dbac0e0a264f6e01af9e","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Pellegrin","original_name":"Raymond Pellegrin","popularity":0.3269,"profile_path":"/iRSPTtrNvUdGJOdFA3Fhv4rKowS.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Armand Boulard","credit_id":"5bf2dbb6c3a36838ab015f2c","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franchot Tone","original_name":"Franchot Tone","popularity":0.2974,"profile_path":"/dI6TE8qane88wOkZGG6alMFjpcu.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"John K.
