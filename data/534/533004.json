Coworkers Gwen and Marc realize that their colleague has been placed under a peculiar curse and begin working together together to break this most unusual spell. Together, the trio hysterically wrestle with what appears to be a demonic force inside of Roger, and comically keep it under wraps from their agitated boss. Our riddle is solved in a transforming way as Roger escapes near death, developing a new respect and appreciation for women. The Creeper's Curse puts a comedic and fantastical twist on what could happen to a sleazy and ignorant male.","popularity":0.1189,"poster_path":"/aoFXUHG5vHVcbcsjAZTxUgYkOB0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Creeper's Curse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2075507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hunter Hoffman","original_name":"Hunter Hoffman","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/lbwxay4QotpUnoqsq1aolrD5lGG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Roger","credit_id":"5b37a4da9251413c6603d136","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1190553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asta Paredes","original_name":"Asta Paredes","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":"/cdHY5Brnfct5nBDtQmIcIfSR9gq.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Gwen","credit_id":"5b37a4d00e0a26401603bd12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2075508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Williams","original_name":"Evan Williams","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/orhANDT10iFqTovKRRERF2HryNw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marc","credit_id":"5b37a4ea0e0a26401c03baf0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1858916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emeka Nwafor","original_name":"Emeka Nwafor","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/8AUdnsEvDgRBvHbn5SOe98c2mMp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Toby","credit_id":"5b37cf470e0a26401a033e79","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2075641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Ryan","original_name":"Ricky Ryan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/d1wzIXPmU3MarID38tyhXALOkvj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Festivo","credit_id":"5b37d0c10e0a26401403eb70","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2075642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brielle Cotello","original_name":"Brielle Cotello","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/l2eeb8Vwzru8wZZn7bqFLziNFTp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Witch","credit_id":"5b37d0f10e0a26401403eb8d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2075624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Blake Rice","original_name":"Blake Rice","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aaYCzxZ2qRURPgcypegT2JJ5PGi.jpg","credit_id":"5b37cb32c3a368532604398c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2075507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hunter Hoffman","original_name":"Hunter Hoffman","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/lbwxay4QotpUnoqsq1aolrD5lGG.jpg","credit_id":"5b37d640c3a368531d03d17f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8180404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tAezI7OUYLE2I1izyPsKB5sz9RL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e9IWRtjgmS0o4f7G8Njir401Ecb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aoFXUHG5vHVcbcsjAZTxUgYkOB0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Out for Festivals","release_date":"2019-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
