Indeed the place is almost deserted except by four faithful patrons, Francis, a garage owner, Pivois, a man with a modest private income, Loulou, a radio technician and Boudoux, an undertaker. Now, the Robustals employ a fanciful but gifted waiter, Hippolyte. This one happens to be infatuated with Liliane, so much so that one day he takes out a life insurance in her favor. The four regulars' reaction is instant: they offer Robustal to execute Hippolyte, in exchange for a commission. But the trouble (at least for them!) is that Hippolyte is indestructible.","popularity":0.1591,"poster_path":"/j0sODlMUuJq7cRvxx4gDkdK0cCw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Cyclope","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1959-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Indestructible","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darry Cowl","original_name":"Darry Cowl","popularity":0.1361,"profile_path":"/9nBYsDgk0NBMV24vmc6XqqvZJT9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hippolyte","credit_id":"65d1127fc144dd0149bdefe2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Line Renaud","original_name":"Line Renaud","popularity":0.4098,"profile_path":"/iQhoonlbQCLF9gci8ULFPSPxwkM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Liliane Robustal","credit_id":"65d1129aaa659e0186427471","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Galabru","original_name":"Michel Galabru","popularity":0.3315,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Augustin Robustal","credit_id":"65d112a3aa659e018642747c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Havard","original_name":"René Havard","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/271KSyY5R6dx8bEQCUuRQ87a8qT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Loulou","credit_id":"65d112ae41eee1017c084f1a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Rollis","original_name":"Robert Rollis","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/33zLRUmvjb0wKyywEe91t1yWXyh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Insurance agent","credit_id":"65d112dd6eecee018a37d7f4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Raimbourg","original_name":"Lucien Raimbourg","popularity":0.1488,"profile_path":"/al9rg1RGdW7z1LAu6kGdsCIzSUS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Boudoux","credit_id":"65d112e741eee100e7083bf6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Armontel","original_name":"Roland Armontel","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":"/sspmSFj1wIOIvHTfRnmzs6FhJkc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pivois","credit_id":"65d112f0988afd0164741700","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Blanche","original_name":"Francis Blanche","popularity":0.1925,"profile_path":"/tqHH6RNErwSPk8avbIzQKkQPc7e.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Francis Blanchard","credit_id":"65d11307f9475b0186d9fa0c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3248250,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Louis Gasté","original_name":"Louis Gasté","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/AgsxUW3oYYksrL9viYLXZWDlfWn.jpg","credit_id":"65d1134f77c01f01870e6b70","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Boyer","original_name":"Jean Boyer","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/xCE7iLFjZxCLIlOzh6ATIbCJlHX.jpg","credit_id":"5b3aa591c3a36845b8011b38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0157817","wikidata_id":"Q3204126","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/j0sODlMUuJq7cRvxx4gDkdK0cCw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Barcelona","release_date":"1961-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
