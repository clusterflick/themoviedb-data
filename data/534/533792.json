As she is being reprimanded in Mrs. Bredwell's office, a misunderstanding results in a member of the football team arriving at the office with Ann's clothes--she had left them behind when she changed into a football uniform so she could play football with the team--and Mrs. Bredwell writes to Ann's father notifying him that Ann is being expelled. She intercepts the letter, but her troubles are far from over.","popularity":0.3247,"poster_path":"/1mqAx9aC5r53FMMsPpy5NXKkgLG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25599,"logo_path":"/sPZZwYvN3xEGo7q8E9iYKrggjDz.png","name":"Famous Players Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Antics of Ann","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Pennington","original_name":"Ann Pennington","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/oOKSOvVfjB1Rc8HcDezXx2Z1K3S.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ann Wharton","credit_id":"5b3d1a9ec3a3685066000371","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Ham","original_name":"Harry Ham","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":"/xQRRfqn8GfdfDjfjYTcRevF5JBw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom Randall","credit_id":"5b3d1aaa92514114aa000312","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ormi Hawley","original_name":"Ormi Hawley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/bmb2jThurXgi4Rdy8hFoaSUOKM6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Olive Wharton","credit_id":"5b3d1ab7925141145f0002b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crauford Kent","original_name":"Crauford Kent","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/zYq9Z283YTCX5FYaG59nVs598TD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gordon Trent","credit_id":"5b3d1ac2c3a3685078000288","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William T.
