Twice a year, at each solstice, she brightens up her rather dull life by meeting up with her lover. Twice a year, on the other side of the sea, on the banks of the immense St. Lawrence River, three hundred thousand snow geese land with a thunderous roar for a few weeks of feasting during their migration. Like a bridge between the time of the solstices and the time of the birds, there is Manon, a twenty-year-old student, and Louise, a large, wounded goose. Louise and Manon, each in their own way, will experience love and give Joanne a new lease on freedom.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":"/gTOI7Xw8i4kMrnYDdADSwLBorrw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine
