Later, during the circus parade, he rides to her assistance, rescuing her from an elephant and thus arousing the ire of the circus manager, whose henchmen begin to chase Tom. Scrambling over the main tent, Tom falls onto the tightrope and lands in a net with the girl while the crowd wildly applauds. Kirk Mallory, who is jealous of Tom's attentions to Millie, frames Tom for a murder; he lands in jail but escapes and reaches Mallory's ranch in time to rescue the girl and administer a thrashing to the villain.","popularity":0.1348,"poster_path":"/ptBjMhDo59YZTR1wkm1IVK74zpo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Circus Ace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mix","original_name":"Tom Mix","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/qTaMWapR1sxjk6mdi3tvRsSMNks.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom Terry","credit_id":"5b39250dc3a36845b8006790","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1051382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Joyce","original_name":"Natalie Joyce","popularity":0.1085,"profile_path":"/JShrz9U1cKSYpLzPek9jhWrSE1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Millie Jane","credit_id":"5b39251ac3a36844f3007a6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duke R.
