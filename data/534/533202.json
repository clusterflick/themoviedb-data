This meditative documentary essay – from a Latvian writer and Lithuanian director whose composed touch has long dovetailed with the stylistically diverse works of the Baltic New Wave – pushes adroitly past the limits of the common his-toriographic investigation to create a portrait of less-clearly remembered filmmakers. The result is a consummate poetic treatment of the ontology of documentary creation. Also a cinematic poem about cinema poets.","popularity":0.1521,"poster_path":"/tnB6H4uj0uAIcsryRR9e95fgOKM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio
