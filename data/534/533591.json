Never allowing itself to be fully comprehendible, the film maneuvers through the unknown with a bizarre, darkly comedic vision. To begin, the man receives a message from an ominous visitor (himself?) suggesting he have a party. Agreeing, he goes upstairs to get ready, and that's where an immortal soul (embodied as a single pea on the floor) catches his attention and leads him on a voyage through time and space. The gloriously strange conceit is delivered with enigmatic visuals and atmospheres and leaves a haunting impression.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Heart Lived in Lonesome Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Finkel","original_name":"Benjamin Finkel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3bb18ac3a3685953000af4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
