Footage of the celebration of the ‘liberation’, a nightmare that would end only in 1945, shows a happy crowd, women with bunches of flowers, one general gives a speech and the other decorates soldiers. The town was renamed Fiume and soon became the site of a bizarre and frightening episode with poet Gabriele D’Annunzio as the violently narcissistic leader of violently nationalistic irregular troops. Fiume, the place and the name, today signifies the beginning of fascism in Italy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iiy0WzH1ns3Y3V62HCE0KcWXgHW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fiume 1918","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Comerio","original_name":"Luca Comerio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/x3jFbuM4FoqBp5g5XCZgO2TOBRQ.jpg","credit_id":"5b3885349251415e88001d94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iiy0WzH1ns3Y3V62HCE0KcWXgHW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
