The strike was directed against the effects of the technocratic university reform that had just been introduced and was supported by all the student councils, especially the sociologists, students of Frankfurt Critical Theory. But this solidarity strike developed into a tangible dispute over the dismantling of authoritarian teaching situations and new emancipatory research strategies. The sociology seminar is occupied and renamed the \"Spartakus Seminar\". Working groups now meet there. The SDS discusses with Professors Habermas, Mitscherlich and v. Friedeburg shortly before the police occupy the seminar at night.","popularity":0.1136,"poster_path":"/wmOKxhcFDB6OQyL6llNKve7GAb4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104560,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aktiver Streik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Aktiver Streik an der Frankfurter Universität","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Aktiver Streik - Universität Frankfurt Wintersemester 1968/69","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2076602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürgen Habermas","original_name":"Jürgen Habermas","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b3b7c99c3a36845fb01f4c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1249611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Cohn-Bendit","original_name":"Daniel Cohn-Bendit","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/a7T3eZ2t0jga6dGnbaHG9lG7k4k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b3b7ca6c3a3684f1a00d082","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20554,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus","original_name":"Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3a097cc3a36845fb010a71","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Günther Hörmann","original_name":"Günther Hörmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3a096a9251416a45003268","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Günther Hörmann","original_name":"Günther Hörmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3a09759251416a45003274","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wmOKxhcFDB6OQyL6llNKve7GAb4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
