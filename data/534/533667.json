George, with his ever-present video-8 camera, attends an opening of Precious Products—an exhibition of artworks satirizing art as commodity. He leaves the art world of San Francisco to spend a Christmas holiday with friends in their opulent home. Ironically, this is the home of a celebrity (another kind of commodity), Russian defector/ballerina Natalia Makanova. Surrounded by all the luxuries of life and Makanova’s image, George muses about death. Panning over a dressing table laden with products, he focuses on a People magazine and comments, 'We are precious products, all of us.'","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1QvzQqZKHQkL5Jsaxv2Mi3gwVuQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Precious Products","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Arkinstall","original_name":"Jane Arkinstall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b3c30d20e0a26240b004e2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynda Diamond","original_name":"Lynda Diamond","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b3c30d992514102b8004045","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Grace","original_name":"Sharon Grace","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b3c30e0c3a368596a003990","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b3c30e8c3a36859600042d8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Griff Kwiat","original_name":"Griff Kwiat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b3c30f00e0a2624190054e5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Morrison","original_name":"Dennis Morrison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b3c30f992514102c4004926","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Polsky","original_name":"Ben Polsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b3c3100c3a368595d004de3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"5b3c310b0e0a2624190054ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0464560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1QvzQqZKHQkL5Jsaxv2Mi3gwVuQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
