On the very day the bulls are being branded, Patrick sees Robert, a long-lost comrade just out of prison. He takes him in and asks for nothing, despite the general hostility. In fact, Robert begins by poaching young Paco, son of the gardian-chef, by offering to rob a bank; then he covets his friend's almost-fiancée, Zeffa; finally, he organizes a devastating expedition against the rice farmers, in short, he behaves like a real \"dog in a poke\", sowing discord and brawl everywhere.","popularity":0.3607,"poster_path":"/ibizX6owwYgrFNAPdqWigY2txl7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack
