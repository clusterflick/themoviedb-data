This XY equation evidently equals: acclaimed comedian.  Ryman has earned the title of Semifinalist on NBC’s Last Comic Standing. Roseanne Barr, a professed fan, raves she has “never seen anything like Tommy before in her whole life, he is one-of-a-kind, fantastic!” Ryman also recently won the title of Best of the Midwest at the prestigious Gilda’s Laugh Fest. Ryman’s act can be described as absurdist and clever, masked behind a very likable and innocent demeanor, often thought of as awkwardly charming. He is a favorite among audiences at top clubs, corporates, and colleges around the nation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tommy Ryman: Activated","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
