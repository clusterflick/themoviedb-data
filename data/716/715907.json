In his distinctive and personable way he reminds his listeners that we don't go to church to be entertained and that if we are bored and uninterested in our sacrament and other meetings it is not the fault of the speakers and teachers. In a very helpful way John teaches the specific things we can do to make church attendance exciting and enjoyable. (Hint: it has to do with changing our attitude.)","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/h9lNfEOMl1GHGQtAlyKQf6txh9r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best 3 Hours of the Week: John Bytheway","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7n4amr2OzMpi60MytGUFoDCeH3M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h9lNfEOMl1GHGQtAlyKQf6txh9r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
