Today it is estimated there are nearly 2 million people dancing hula in Japan â€“ a figure greater than the entire population of Hawaii. With more people dancing hula in Japan than in Hawaii where the native art was born, this phenomenal growth has created a multi-million dollar industry based on culture as commodity. But what motivates Japanese students and teachers to dance hula and how is it translated into a foreign culture? How do Native Hawaiians participate in this cross-cultural exchange? Through the personal stories of Hawaiian master hula teachers and Japanese teachers and dancers, the documentary examines how tourism, economics and a love affair with the islands of Hawaii has made hula big business in Japan.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Hula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisette Marie Flanary","original_name":"Lisette Marie Flanary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee7b28c3ff2df00226a328b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tokyo Hula, directed by  Lisette Marie Flanary, Doc Edge Festival 2020","key":"6kmaErup-2w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-25T00:59:08.000Z","id":"5ee7b2cba217c00022d72595"}]}}}
