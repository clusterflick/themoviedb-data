Several years ago, she had to put an end to her gloriously drafted independent feature film and went off the grid. She heads to a bar to meet her friend Seonjun who used to make films together. There she bumps into Xingxing, the starring actress of her flop. Xingxing still features in independent films and builds her career. She is with director Ki, the producer of her upcoming film. Xingxing suggests that the three sit together. Director Ki is insensitive and crude as if those features represent a true artist. When he begins to talk about Ranhee’s film, she can’t help but become very sensitive.","popularity":0.0779,"poster_path":"/b4SKL8qPtA8lKhYbp3PHeqSXJYL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Each","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2104895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geum Hannah","original_name":"금해나","popularity":0.5823,"profile_path":"/1UmNUfz2jPj8hXNdE36kDyy4cW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ranhee","credit_id":"615bbbe9eb14fa002a77bec4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2160007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sim Eun-woo","original_name":"Sim Eun-woo","popularity":0.1653,"profile_path":"/6fyTLTt2SVWV1Dm7hn9W1Ifcq9h.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Xingxing","credit_id":"615bbc0f81c7be0025e35bdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2882631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Sung-jun","original_name":"Park Sung-jun","popularity":0.3498,"profile_path":"/pklGYrZBGjO7wPLvSJgCNTjHkZ0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"선준","credit_id":"63758ed32faf4d0082fedb32","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2679436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kang Jeong-in","original_name":"Kang Jeong-in","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615bbc75eb14fa0043df9310","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2679436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kang Jeong-in","original_name":"Kang Jeong-in","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee753d3afa1b00022c206dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":882,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4SKL8qPtA8lKhYbp3PHeqSXJYL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":588}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Korean\", \"english_name\"=>\"Korean\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ko\", \"native_name\"=>\"Korean\"}","note":"The 21th JEONJU Intl.
