The professor and students were never seen alive again. The remains of only five of the victims were ever found, among the barren hills on the road to Cieneguilla. The evidence led to the eventual conviction, in 2009, of members of the Grupo Colina death squad and of Former President Alberto Fujimori for human rights abuse crimes.","popularity":0.0944,"poster_path":"/idd92wPccs91l1du0M4APWbNEUT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8429,"logo_path":"/oFafSWR98EUPZ0KJeRDB6ZJ84Ty.png","name":"TV Cultura","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2011-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Cantuta en la Boca del Diablo","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Gonzales","original_name":"Amanda Gonzales","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee65da20cb3350020bd3e8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Gonzales","original_name":"Amanda Gonzales","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee65f2e97eab40020e92f60","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678673,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Lauer","original_name":"Johannes Lauer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee65f4897eab4001ee74460","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laura Robles","original_name":"Laura Robles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee65f5acb71b8001eb5a1b7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":966799,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roberto Benavides","original_name":"Roberto Benavides","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee690b80cb335001fbe9da5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036172,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fergan Chávez-Ferrer","original_name":"Fergan Chávez-Ferrer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61999c65c26c003706c8a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5810726","wikidata_id":"Q123377165","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uSHBmYu1BfSWYzgUrG0t9dCDQX3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/idd92wPccs91l1du0M4APWbNEUT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lIKMYQbnD5gT2j6UIVwJD5yAl7c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":839}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
