A glimpse of night life in a cabaret, unrestrained abandonment, escape by jazz. Then suddenly a man carrying a swastika bursts in. And everything changes, a giant hand grabs the beautiful singer - a trav - and drops his wig. Artists, lovers, Jews find themselves in a \"salad basket\" towards the camps. The camera points to one of them, who is wearing a pink triangle. Animated on dark backgrounds in a style akin to German expressionism, Triangle laments but does not preach, producing a very moving effect in this.","popularity":0.1089,"poster_path":"/fAreswKaaCbOTawFRMmHj75UYBp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triangle","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pink Triangle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":174463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Doucette","original_name":"Bob Doucette","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee71150afa1b00020c061e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0403619","wikidata_id":"Q116978351","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fAreswKaaCbOTawFRMmHj75UYBp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Specific completion date not listed","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
