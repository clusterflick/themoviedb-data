Aware that all contact is a creation of dependency, the sertanista Sydney Possuelo, who also reflexively narrates the documentary, leads the expeditions that aim to identify the groups, how many individuals there are, establishing territorial limits to protect the area against invaders and loggers in the region.","popularity":0.1801,"poster_path":"/93CNgcuhLj5QLuNLgT7NheHJD8Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Os Arara","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Possuelo","original_name":"Sydney Possuelo","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ee6ad53cb71b8001eb5dff3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Tonacci","original_name":"Andrea Tonacci","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/zBTAI9B2Pu3K1gzxUH8R9IYIAt.jpg","credit_id":"5ee6ad6c3ff2df00216a3039","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10699650","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":837,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ikSeNTDbDwt5vZcP53xLoOvgoIm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":587},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/93CNgcuhLj5QLuNLgT7NheHJD8Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":5968,"name":"amazon rainforest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"pt\", \"native_name\"=>\"Portuguese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
