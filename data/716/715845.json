That summer it had been twenty years since we had walked on the moon. I was jealous of that, so I decided to paint my walls to make a lunar decoration. During the fall I traveled across Europe and wrote a lot. Moona Luna is the result of these two moments.\r This is my first trip to the moon. On the set I authorized Doctor Bonami to become Mr. Bad Actor. Virgins always say everything, so I kept the first shot. The story evokes three sailors working on a French boat and a professor of physics. There may not be whales, but there are many other things.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5goR41g9XIjwivdhs2KW8wQ9BnY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moona Luna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Breer","original_name":"Emily Breer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee7403aafa1b00022c1e402","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ACOhjbbxCNG6bpfvN0IdU2TEjo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5goR41g9XIjwivdhs2KW8wQ9BnY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
