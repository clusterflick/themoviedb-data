An offer from Theo Theodolite to join him in a fried chicken outlet has little attraction for the Waghorn family. However Thoe’s daughter Wilga sees a different side to Henry and his training skills and their relationship might have flourished if Henry Senior hadn’t had an unfortunate accident.  Finally the truth of the accident is discovered and the explosive finale sheds new light on the need for better-trained chickens.","popularity":0.0668,"poster_path":"/gGjm46X9l52aNW6UFVUD7lA4xSh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135581,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent and General Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":294,"logo_path":"/a05DY2oSeUOVFDM61RsQa9x9RoC.png","name":"New Zealand Film Commission","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Egg and Bomb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Wright","original_name":"John Wright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"5ee4877aa217c00022d0fcdd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norelle Ahrens","original_name":"Norelle Ahrens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Wilga","credit_id":"5ee487980cb3350020bbbccc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvio Famularo","original_name":"Silvio Famularo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Theo","credit_id":"5ee489fb97eab4001fe3728f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Vere-Jones","original_name":"Peter Vere-Jones","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/dfVJn5bRpK5qRnxNoloRf8xSHrB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Uncle","credit_id":"5ee48a3ecb71b8001cb3a811","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361390,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janet Roddick","original_name":"Janet Roddick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Clarice","credit_id":"5ee48a7c97eab40020e5ed5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Harcourt","original_name":"Kate Harcourt","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/x4fzhg2Elz1nueeMBsh44vc6hpu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Aunty","credit_id":"5ee48a99cb71b8001db3a2b8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Barrett","original_name":"Paul Barrett","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/u9HIZSZSQXmrLIoJQyzBEJuUhoZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Waghorn (senior)","credit_id":"5ee48b050cb3350022bc2b50","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394069,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Port","original_name":"George Port","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/mrxyc6sgciIfvmtuyLhzHvqtNFg.jpg","credit_id":"6387e7c4229ae215b4609ba5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394069,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Port","original_name":"George Port","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/mrxyc6sgciIfvmtuyLhzHvqtNFg.jpg","credit_id":"6387e7a3a410c8008cd62cec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394069,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Port","original_name":"George Port","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/mrxyc6sgciIfvmtuyLhzHvqtNFg.jpg","credit_id":"6387e7abfb8346008771cc4b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676818,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Bennett","original_name":"Michael Bennett","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee487f697eab4001de20082","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Norman Elder","original_name":"Norman Elder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee4880c97eab4001de200ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3AzOb9LlA5HC5HmHUEzBsZreDi7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gGjm46X9l52aNW6UFVUD7lA4xSh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"New Zealand International Film Festival","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Egg and the Bomb -
