Once in Darjeeling he built a Monastery at 54 Gandhi Road. It was here where the few single-minded Westerners in search of a more meaningful life, began to arrive in the late 1960’s.  Told through the eyes of one of those first Westerners, New Zealander Kim Hegan, as he now, more than 40 years after Rinpoche’s passing, and his Buddhist practice abandoned, will trace the journey he made to Darjeeling 45 years earlier, to tell Rinpoche’s profound story, while healing the trauma that kept him away for so long.","popularity":0.085,"poster_path":"/h8pmm48gX8ztkgRD6DbGaCHienP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2020-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to Gandhi Road","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthieu Ricard","original_name":"Matthieu Ricard","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vzjKn6to28nFnnytDWQGLRz6G9x.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"64eb153ec3c89101007d9edc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yeshe Hegan","original_name":"Yeshe Hegan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee7a572cb71b8001fb60cf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107586,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fred Renata","original_name":"Fred Renata","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f692bf4dbcade003632f65e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787391,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Hegan","original_name":"Kim Hegan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f692bda57530e0036bc1dd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062462,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Margot Francis","original_name":"Margot Francis","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f692c121b1f3c0039b116be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12572442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h8pmm48gX8ztkgRD6DbGaCHienP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kangyur Rinpoche Documentary - Official Film Trailer 2020","key":"q-diZYF-epo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-07T06:56:19.000Z","id":"5ee7a4f0a4f03c001d246dc8"}]}}}
