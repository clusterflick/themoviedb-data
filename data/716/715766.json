In the 1960s, the families there were uprooted and their homes demolished in the name of urban renewal and integration. More than 20 years later, the site of the community of Africville is a stark, under-utilized park. Former residents, their descendants and some of the decision-makers speak out and, with the help of archival photographs and films, tell the story of that painful relocation.","popularity":0.2325,"poster_path":"/rCvm3vloIc4mDT8bZc5Z1n45pQp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remember Africville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2679145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delvina Bernard","original_name":"Delvina Bernard","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5ee6e4789715ae001fa658f0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1643052,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shelagh Mackenzie","original_name":"Shelagh Mackenzie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee6e454afa1b00022c1242b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rCvm3vloIc4mDT8bZc5Z1n45pQp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":41602,"name":"forced relocation"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
