The film concerns a man, violent in nature, driven much against his will into a realization of his soul. At first he combats this realization and fails. He tries to master it and fails. He tries to destroy it and fails. Finally, in the only way he knows how, being faithful to his nature, he accepts it by offering his whole being to its truth. He uses his nature as a prayer and offers his beating heart.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apocalypse 3:16","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Charlot","original_name":"Martin Charlot","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee3d8b9d20c87002130c403","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
