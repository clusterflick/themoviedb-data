The science of “good birth”, which aims to create the perfect human being, sets out to achieve this by preventing reproduction of those perceived as weak, sick, disabled, or otherwise “degenerate”. As early as 1907, the US applied the first eugenics laws, which continued to be in force until the 1970s. In Sweden, 63,000 people were sterilized, mostly after WWII. The film switches deftly between the explanation of historians and the testimony of victims who continue to struggle for recognition of the harm they have suffered, which has been erased from the collective memory. From North Carolina to Sweden and Germany, a terrifying journey into this quest for the “best of worlds”.","popularity":0.2569,"poster_path":"/atpzXGUreFJz3JQVCXiBBMkOrLy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135684,"logo_path":null,"name":"SENSO Films","origin_country":""},{"id":135685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geppert Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hygiène raciale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Rashygienens historia","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","original_name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee62eaca217c0001fd3186f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157844,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valérie Brégaint","original_name":"Valérie Brégaint","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee62ed53ff2df001f67a2c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","original_name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee62ec697eab4001fe5468d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","original_name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee62e9397eab4001ee70680","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","original_name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee62e8d3ff2df002068c0c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","original_name":"Guillaume Dreyfus","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee62e9ea217c00020d1d5c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2678466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Mora","original_name":"Jacques Mora","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee62ebccb71b8001eb571f8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/atpzXGUreFJz3JQVCXiBBMkOrLy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":267596,"name":"rasbiologi"},{"id":267599,"name":"racial hygiene"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"sv\", \"native_name\"=>\"Swedish\"}","note":"Kunskapskanalen","release_date":"2013-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
