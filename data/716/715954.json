The Game of Love and Chance (French: Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard) is a three-act romantic comedy by French playwright Marivaux. The Game of Love and Chance was first performed 23 January 1730 by the Comédie Italienne. In this play, a young woman is visited by her betrothed, whom she does not know. To get a better idea of the type of person he is, she trades places with her servant and disguises herself. However, unbeknownst to her, her fiancé has the same idea and trades places with his valet. The \"game\" pits the two false servants against the two false masters, and in the end, the couples fall in love with their appropriate counterpart.","popularity":0.3391,"poster_path":"/dgEWQsGDlmKyBFVlr2p5JWMzsdt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theatre de la porte Saint-Martin","origin_country":""},{"id":135748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Théâtre Actuel","origin_country":""},{"id":28839,"logo_path":"/mCAwAvHYtWZyAU50uuxmiUgzPfT.png","name":"La Compagnie des Indes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Game of Love and Chance","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":983929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laure Calamy","original_name":"Laure Calamy","popularity":0.532,"profile_path":"/ov3BaihlXFRTzKTc7Hs5KWskEi4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lisette","credit_id":"5ee799a4afa1b00020c0e21a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1789141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Dedienne","original_name":"Vincent Dedienne","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":"/j6tser7BHGoi6cP7bQAXQlCGbMO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bourguignon","credit_id":"5ee799ad15794a001e15863d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clotilde Hesme","original_name":"Clotilde Hesme","popularity":0.4301,"profile_path":"/hPWDBjjk0OJaMdiVRaUBL7jeAcZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Silvia","credit_id":"5ee799b7afa1b00020c0e227","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Maury","original_name":"Nicolas Maury","popularity":0.1959,"profile_path":"/31wQP13EufTzCtldFBU2ckmLsve.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dorante","credit_id":"5ee799becb71b8001cb93988","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Pralon","original_name":"Alain Pralon","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/uENDhemzmtyljhZ7wHJtnfdZeh6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Orgon","credit_id":"5ee799cbcb71b8001cb9399a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyrille Thouvenin","original_name":"Cyrille Thouvenin","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/8wwDyiG0S2Hq1Var8o6SXzYpIx7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"5ee799d4cb71b8001db818e5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Hiegel","original_name":"Catherine Hiegel","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/pcbGRRllIm5vaVjrPgpW0Fyq3TL.jpg","credit_id":"5ee799679715ae0020a69ee8","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Thiel","original_name":"Dominique Thiel","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/d41GXFjFOo8xrDV1InafheTLQYt.jpg","credit_id":"5ee79fc6a4f03c001d2467eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587643,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marivaux","original_name":"Marivaux","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/rR7nDsj4AyXtwGwoudUKVjcP6tc.jpg","credit_id":"66d6da572113eef0eadd54fc","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12526820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dgEWQsGDlmKyBFVlr2p5JWMzsdt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 5","release_date":"2020-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Spectacle – « Le jeu de l’amour et du hasard »","key":"-TBAFp1TeL4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-13T09:46:00.000Z","id":"5ee79a5b9715ae001fa743a5"}]}}}
