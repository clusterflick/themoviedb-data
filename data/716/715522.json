Not surprisingly, there is an emphasis on Swedish athletes. We also see a large Swedish choir performing, although the coverage is, of course, silent. And we see Swedish system team gymnastics, which was an official event, although only three nations took part. The Swedish system consisted of calisthenic-type exercises.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/71WgLDeqF1T46dWj2TO9rmlT2Ts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1912-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olympiade in Antwerpen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/71WgLDeqF1T46dWj2TO9rmlT2Ts.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"english_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"xx\", \"native_name\"=>\"No Language\"}","note":"","release_date":"1912-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
