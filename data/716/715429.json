Nothing is at it seems as the plasticine starts to fly - just don't get too close to the screen. A fantastical clay animation treat.  The jazzy score and trench-coat wearing protagonist in this claymation short promise film noir.  But it soon becomes apparent that the room for rent has something more sinister lurking in it to explain its availability and lack of furnishing.  When the supernatural being attacks the man and his oversized revolver, he has more to worry about than his brain rotting from too much TV.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6uY2kvR8VQOjrNybkJvOO9tcBU8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hot Off The Prescott Productions Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":135634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coupleabucks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unfurnished Room for Rent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2677920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Prescott","original_name":"Barry Prescott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qowFofI9i0CkTm3ul962qtlCxWa.jpg","credit_id":"5ee581813ff2df002067b31a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2677920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Prescott","original_name":"Barry Prescott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qowFofI9i0CkTm3ul962qtlCxWa.jpg","credit_id":"5ee5815497eab4001fe47b5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2677920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Prescott","original_name":"Barry Prescott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qowFofI9i0CkTm3ul962qtlCxWa.jpg","credit_id":"5ee5816bcb71b8001cb56a74","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677922,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Baron","original_name":"Richard Baron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee581d33ff2df002067b3ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677928,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anne Gummer","original_name":"Anne Gummer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee583fd0cb335001fbd3ae6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357281,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Sedgley","original_name":"Simon Sedgley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee581fea217c00022d2e4ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677930,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Frewin","original_name":"Paul Frewin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee5831697eab40020e7b5b2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677935,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Beard","original_name":"Rachel Beard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee58426a217c00022d2e9ef","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677929,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Glyn Frewin","original_name":"Glyn Frewin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee582fb3ff2df002168072d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wV0XWaiTHh6y1nrS5Xa3vnqJQkI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6uY2kvR8VQOjrNybkJvOO9tcBU8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shown at the, Palm Springs International Film Festival.","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
