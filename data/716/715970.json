Revered for its weighty commentary on world affairs, The New Yorker found its sweet side in the wit, whimsy and sheer joie de vivre of Jim’s illustrations and articles. Opening as the artist celebrates his 85th birthday, STEVENSON - LOST AND FOUND is a bitter-sweet romp through the stellar, 67-year career of a remarkable artist. An odyssey of discovery and loss the film unearths a truly dazzling volume of work while facing, head-on, the dark and tragic struggles of the artist and those who loved him","popularity":0.7435,"poster_path":"/ofZtP7kmv2QPRvp8L70FwOz6Dyc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The many lives of New Yorker cartoonist James Stevenson","title":"Stevenson - Lost and Found","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Furr","original_name":"David Furr","popularity":0.3311,"profile_path":"/orA7m2qiLRkOzQY1wWqeakciTWl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5f4161706a34480036b36e2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2751535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Stevenson","original_name":"James Stevenson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"(self)","credit_id":"5f4163ff028f14003260712b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2679882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally Jean Williams","original_name":"Sally Jean Williams","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee7a8b0cb71b8001cb954aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116085,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Bacon","original_name":"Michael Bacon","popularity":0.1711,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4163ab0bb0760031d23b98","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902533,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Deborah Peretz","original_name":"Deborah Peretz","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4162bf6a34480036b37ac7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Grubin","original_name":"David Grubin","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4162a881a7fc0036097fbb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2751532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josie Merck","original_name":"Josie Merck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4162380bb0760033d2e121","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624228,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Axel Baumann","original_name":"Axel Baumann","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4163cf81a7fc003609815c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11193522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"stevensonlostandfound","instagram_id":"stevenson_lost.and.found","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ofZtP7kmv2QPRvp8L70FwOz6Dyc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OFFICIAL TRAILER: STEVENSON - LOST AND FOUND","key":"365720160","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-11T09:32:35.000Z","id":"5ee7a9153ff2df00226a1b4c"}]}}}
