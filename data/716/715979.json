He grew up watching and learning the process of the hangi through his ancestors during the whanau Christmas parties they had in Maketu. Neil decided to take this knowledge to his new home in South Auckland, Manurewa and begin creating his own hangi with the help of his whanau. Guiding his younger generations through the 7 hour procedure, we watch as the Reid whanau create New Zealands oldest Maori dish, bringing friends and family from all over to enjoy this historic kai together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Koro's Hāngi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2679902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Aro-Reid","original_name":"Gianni Aro-Reid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee7acc13ff2df00216c4143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Koro's Hangi Trailer.
