Resonating with Wilson's precise visual stylization, the tape's pivotal image is a young boy looking through a large window in the kitchen of his home, which becomes the portal for his dramatic, often startling inner fantasies. Fire, metal, wind, glass and water, among other elements, serve as points of departure for a series of elegant pictorial compositions and evocative metaphors. Unfolding without dialogue or spoken language, Wilson's indelible visions articulate the fear and mystery of the internal life of a child, and his relation to the outside world.","popularity":0.2571,"poster_path":"/oSbiZAuifeLdSYotuoPS1jiEu7J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stations","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1536658,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolas Economou","original_name":"Nicolas Economou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c18178d8e225001cc8aff8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Wilson","original_name":"Robert Wilson","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/c2NHsGT1n1QmHlWkVKKzZ7Wy4Pm.jpg","credit_id":"5ee67f270cb335001fbe8a82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0491169","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oSbiZAuifeLdSYotuoPS1jiEu7J.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQVSOQZhG89fJtls7IWC1bxeaQ3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1566,"name":"dreams"},{"id":2857,"name":"elephant"},{"id":18379,"name":"bee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
