Vincenzo Bellini's much too rarely staged Romeo and Juliet opera, I Capuleti e i Montecchi, is far removed from Shakespeare's version: rather than telling the story of a tenderly burgeoning love, the piece is an account of the last 24 hours in the two young people's lives. The underlying mood of the piece is thus one of melancholy - which then develops into a catastrophic maelstrom. The premi√®re of the thrilling Zurich production of this bel canto gem, directed by Christof Loy and conducted by Fabio Luisi, was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences alike. The two protagonists also met with acclaim: experience world star Joyce DiDonato in the trouser role of Romeo, with the young Ukrainia soprano Olga Kulchynska at her side as Giulietta.","popularity":0.2196,"poster_path":"/2vE9RqnbVk8l6aG9GcqbUyjNC5A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bellini: I Capuleti e i Montecchi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":276525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce DiDonato","original_name":"Joyce DiDonato","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":"/myd2U5QoH8dEx5TxTEZuA5cnMzw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Romeo","credit_id":"60b49c94a066450041410933","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Kulchynska","original_name":"Olga Kulchynska","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Giulietta","credit_id":"60b49ca5c740d9002b2686d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Bernheim","original_name":"Benjamin Bernheim","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tebaldo","credit_id":"60b49cb56dea3a006f6d10d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Lorenzi","original_name":"Roberto Lorenzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lorenzo","credit_id":"60b49cc63e09f3007a04f4b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexei Botnarciuc","original_name":"Alexei Botnarciuc","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Capellio","credit_id":"60b49ce17d5504002a4e76ee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gieorgij Puchalski","original_name":"Gieorgij Puchalski","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Der Begleiter","credit_id":"60b49cf57d5504007c3b47e7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284199,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabio Luisi","original_name":"Fabio Luisi","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/oleLkdfMGLmuQ4VBcyVtdubIKVi.jpg","credit_id":"60b49d0d62e86f002b3e7b34","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2vE9RqnbVk8l6aG9GcqbUyjNC5A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1104}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
