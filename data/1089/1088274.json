From its very first image, The Natural Son establishes Chor as a filmmaker of stylistic flourish, which would be sustained in various forms throughout his long tenure. Adapted from '30 cents' pulp fiction, it is a Kong Ngee melodrama made in the studio's mould, with Westernised characters and trendy middle-class lifestyles. Yet, Chor's first film is not exempt from the social urgency that characterises the Cantonese cinema of his father, Cheung Wood-yau. The film cloaks its entertainment in a moral deliberation on blood ties, its story about the raising of a bastard child a head-on challenge of archaic family values. An ostentatious start for a colourful and eventful career.","popularity":0.5616,"poster_path":"/tCqdVzoz12PPtdUik3wY4yBz68N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kong Ngee Motion Picture Production Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1959-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Natural Son","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Grass by the Lake","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1786123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patsy Ka Ling","original_name":"Patsy Ka Ling","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/cUjBIIrryfQaGAHMEnxHSzJs3xD.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Fong Man-yu","credit_id":"667d6fc8ed2c184e438d0477","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nam Hung","original_name":"南紅","popularity":0.2307,"profile_path":"/mT28BYk2VjixjMKVLkWXEp9hYS5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fong Man-wai","credit_id":"63f003e3caaca200b9f4fd5a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Tse Yin","original_name":"謝賢","popularity":0.6409,"profile_path":"/5neIbXmuvtdQIygHu6D2wighYwW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Chui Chung-ming","credit_id":"63f003f5a67254008202546c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2405230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Yat-fan","original_name":"Kong Yat-fan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/bbydYBauAHSc5wqMPPLRJyCRM0m.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mok Wai-sang","credit_id":"63f00405a6725400c9f23464","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keung Chung-Ping","original_name":"Keung Chung-Ping","popularity":0.2008,"profile_path":"/fDcMsdLB6ICeQoHWT46fjRucR76.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wan Sum-man","credit_id":"63f00416caaca2008576e9ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Cho-San","original_name":"黃楚山","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fong's father","credit_id":"63f00427caaca200892d7f47","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1331008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Yuet-Ching","original_name":"Lee Yuet-Ching","popularity":0.2055,"profile_path":"/a9A9jftrtex67LcxOax7uFWXS4w.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fong's mother","credit_id":"63f00438a24c5000a13bf2d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1827164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeung Yip-Wang","original_name":"楊業宏","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mok's father","credit_id":"63f00447a24c5000848c154d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1581279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ma Siu-Ying","original_name":"Ma Siu-Ying","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/vocqq2QEsqxFVdX0R0qT2gjsPho.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mok's mother","credit_id":"63f0045c4a4bfc0096374e7e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chor Yuen","original_name":"楚原","popularity":0.6771,"profile_path":"/zDHHM7CAVoixsgkRDwmxqtTxpAi.jpg","credit_id":"63f0046d4a4bfc00f07c5c14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507375,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ho Chee Siang","original_name":"Ho Chee Siang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f0049ba24c5000c0b84e5b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Bing","original_name":"Wong Bing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f00518caaca2008576e9f7","department":"Directing","job":"Continuity"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2125950,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hsu Tang","original_name":"Hsu Tang","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f005ec4a4bfc008ecd81b1","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3356150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kwok Keung","original_name":"Kwok Keung","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f004f115376c008bbf6283","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1505980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eddie H.
