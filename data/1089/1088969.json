The young birds are then sold for $50,000 each, usually to wealthy Arabs. The white falcon is the biggest and strongest falcon in the world; tragically most of them die when exposed to the heat of the desert. The film investigates the methods of the smugglers and shows interviews with falcon dealers, policemen, animal protectors in Europe and America and includes authentic shots from a \"falconbust\" in Cologne, Germany.","popularity":0.0436,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magma films","origin_country":"IS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"International Falcon Smuggling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203272,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vilhjálmur Ragnarsson","original_name":"Vilhjálmur Ragnarsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f233c4a6725400c9f33c96","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3070647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ralph Christians","original_name":"Ralph Christians","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f2339215376c00cb236476","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3070647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ralph Christians","original_name":"Ralph Christians","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f233895249780084f6b51d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":52676,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael John","original_name":"Michael John","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f233cc15376c00b1eeb48c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929671,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Klaus Schäfer","original_name":"Klaus Schäfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f2339ca672540082036038","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3052053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hjörtur Howser","original_name":"Hjörtur Howser","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f233b74a4bfc008ece881f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929672,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Werner Schäfer","original_name":"Werner Schäfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f233a45249780084f6b536","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ehlers","original_name":"Michael Ehlers","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f233aea672540082036045","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
