The film was designed to promote the city of Dublin to its inhabitants and to potential visitors from abroad. Brendan J. Stafford’s crisp black and white cinematography serves the city’s elegant architecture well while the narrator tells of the city’s cultural, literary and architectural history and its many venerable inhabitants. The elegant Georgian squares, the bustling markets, the tranquil parks and the sparkling nightlife present a city that is vibrant, cultured and steeped in history.","popularity":0.1507,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Irish Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Dublin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4189931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Jordan","original_name":"John Jordan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64c7d19c41aac40fb7146a82","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liam Ó Laoghaire","original_name":"Liam Ó Laoghaire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f1889bcaaca2007f5ea7c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015077,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brendan J.
