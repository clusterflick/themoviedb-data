This famine was not preceded by any cataclysmic weather event, nor by a war. This was an ideological crime: decided by Stalin and approved by the Politburo, with the aim of punishing Ukrainian peasants who refused the collectivization of the countryside, cultivated a strong form of nationalism and showed resistance to communist ideology. Drawing on previously unpublished material, on many Soviet films and on a number of particular points of view, including that of Welsh journalist and whistleblower Gareth Jones, this film retraces the story of that famine.","popularity":0.3262,"poster_path":"/qTNjg3fttNN9qLZZt6IfKUvW4hm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2426,"logo_path":"/ebQiHrVpqSs93D3A6eEDy9OFO52.png","name":"Les Films du Poisson","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":57585,"logo_path":"/4ihpCz9d24N4TFqSFEWZ18xQCKI.png","name":"Lobster Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeds of Hunger - Ukraine 1933","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Ukraine 1933: Seeds Of Hunger","type":"(English, Alternative Title)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kester Lovelace","original_name":"Kester Lovelace","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":"/h8Q3nQk0raypAkJmUS0vBJTbKqM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gareth Jones (voice)","credit_id":"67b83adf21d4708b60eb4837","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3548355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Wautlet","original_name":"Elisabeth Wautlet","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":"/7km9DYB4DkqM5EIKOVEUuKWQqR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Soviet Authorities (voice)","credit_id":"67b83af9550329275622624b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Less \"Leslie\" Clack","original_name":"Less \"Leslie\" Clack","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/7fEnPOsS6mtSr5xdU0rEmwfFz9Z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Edouard Herriot (voice) (as Les Clack)","credit_id":"67b83b6c21d4708b60eb48d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Di Giacomo","original_name":"Jerry Di Giacomo","popularity":0.1886,"profile_path":"/ryLffIaRI2uzJOUndFIip1q06DF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Italian Consul (voice)","credit_id":"67b83b8221d4708b60eb48e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Starcevic","original_name":"Ken Starcevic","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Walter Duranty (voice)","credit_id":"67b83b9bbc84d56cbeba5b0a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2059250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Sherfield","original_name":"Bruce Sherfield","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/eV13Ihe8Mt0Q6ZOAxGTFrYZuabO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Accounts (voice)","credit_id":"67b83bb4444dd7fcefba5dd2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2898022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillaume Ribot","original_name":"Guillaume Ribot","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f1d57c5249780084f690fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1699556,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Svetlana Vaynblat","original_name":"Svetlana Vaynblat","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fd0e3c5ada500dee6752e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22020462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKPn7yat9iJ3ymloL1SuInrs7CU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qTNjg3fttNN9qLZZt6IfKUvW4hm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":188266,"name":"starvation"},{"id":214548,"name":"1930s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIPADOC Festival","release_date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
