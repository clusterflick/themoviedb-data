This route was the scene of a tragic accident in the 18th century, when young farmers moving a flock of sheep to the North, perished in a snowstorm. For many years following the incident the track was not used, until the 19th century, when Captain Daniel Bruun from Denmark, accompanied by a photographer and a water-colour artist, crossed the difficult terrain, deep rivers, and rocky heights in sun, rain, fog and wind, marking the way with stones laboriously heaped into cairns.","popularity":0.1082,"poster_path":"/8tA4Th3BOAQtoPGoQr8JJjVLcze.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193778,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ísfilm (IS)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1983-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Across the Interior of Iceland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081289,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Indriði G.
