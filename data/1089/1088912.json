The album’s first track, “Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres,” encompassed the entirety of Side 1 on the original release and was the logical, heady continuation of the epic album-ending Kings track, “Cygnus X-1.” Side 2 commenced with the hard-driving commentary on English culture “Circumstances,” followed by the socially aware and environmentally conscious FM radio hit “The Trees,” and concluded with the instrumental tour de force and longtime concert favorite, “La Villa Strangiato.”","popularity":0.6405,"poster_path":"/2nV3Mjqu36QjCc6U192zew90F4z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rush - Hemispheres (40th Anniversary Edition)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geddy Lee","original_name":"Geddy Lee","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/raaVKa1Dr29hLCZhY7ryOsaNSqx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63f21771a6725400a3a308ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Lifeson","original_name":"Alex Lifeson","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/7daAAB0ZXXsq82IxdBPoCFcyoOz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63f217845249780096426def","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Peart","original_name":"Neil Peart","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/q5VO9FDmiG7iz36SBfj5m1UfH33.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63f21796524978009e78090e","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fyB3sfTvYbGctbXxbGSRuQzcvdW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ftSEC10hl9TXB8c7wx3ahXQ24QW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rqbJVDdtsdHJFLqIokK3Egs0xE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w2Lm8zKidXFrsH4EGIrrjsJVGMy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/feetOmqVLKTl2UheQvHNTIQhFvP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tKUOqV9b0gu4Mxw0F1odyaYHAVO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4DtL6DQUn0piZ0blIsva8VxHzkv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gYIQQ6ziIDkLPYf4RqK8wiqNvR1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFTCRtCO8cvEKsEQUv0aulPEt1k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJGbYYovA6fdMdDHrSECGlLJJva.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2nV3Mjqu36QjCc6U192zew90F4z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2KLcsW0VMgoZO1DrJbS22A8aw2S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
