Evie doesnâ€™t seem to talk very much, though we learn she communicates with everything - the plants, grass, water, TV static and the starlings that gather over the sea. As murmurations form, so awakens a sense of understanding, connection and acceptance between mother and daughter. Murmur is a story of beauty and awe, utilising the stunning spectacle of the murmuration, a sign of greatness, as a metaphor for Autism Advocacy.","popularity":0.596,"poster_path":"/gACK8qttGLM6QqcHIywS2FJoj7W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135346,"logo_path":"/hIwjhVdOOQ1fpdebwOuDQD7bnw0.png","name":"Sky
