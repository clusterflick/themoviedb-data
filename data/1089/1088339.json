Joni Waka also claims that he is the only Jew left in Japan descending from the old Jewish families in the country: a self-proclaimed outsider, a mythomaniac, a homosexual, and the natural center of every party. Confronted with a social pressure, he seems to ignore dominating norms and morals while using his outside position as a henna gaijin (the \"strangest stranger\") as a space of freedom to stage his life and create an everyday comedy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qMhtjJUqg1Yi8KF8zplrov2Ta58.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strangest Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Magnus Bärtås","original_name":"Magnus Bärtås","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b70d35abbc72a4072cb3a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Magnus Bärtås","original_name":"Magnus Bärtås","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b70cd25b893ff6caa5f26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6004326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lSMe4weK0HKEdoZUiGqU2Bo6UhD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bEWFljoLQB0PmtD1dwMaUYF8ilG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qMhtjJUqg1Yi8KF8zplrov2Ta58.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
