The family turns out to be a young girl, Patsy Smith, and her elderly grandfather who need lots of help. This delays Larry from following his dream and going to Venice and becoming a gondolier. Instead, he becomes a street singer and, while singing in the street, meets a pretty welfare worker, Susan Sprague. She takes a dim view of Patsy's welfare under the guardianship of Larry and her grandfather and starts proceedings to have Patsy placed in an orphanage.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/1qpr2k4IQCCuRGnCcOnBGxJYrWE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"FUN...when Crosby croons himself out of jail and lands on a merry-go-round with the meanest of brats!","title":"Pennies from Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":6.857,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bing Crosby","original_name":"Bing Crosby","popularity":0.5428,"profile_path":"/pKd9vFb9t157v03D4BS1bc5PqOd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Larry Poole","credit_id":"52fe4d4c9251416c75136a15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Evans","original_name":"Madge Evans","popularity":0.2079,"profile_path":"/pl8Za5y7tmMoCgTRkpCcSFISvxd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Susan Sprague","credit_id":"52fe4d4d9251416c75136a19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":174992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Fellows","original_name":"Edith Fellows","popularity":0.2192,"profile_path":"/A1aJD5G8g6fH8zAM0MQsb7lSvGQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Patsy Smith","credit_id":"52fe4d4d9251416c75136a1d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Armstrong","original_name":"Louis Armstrong","popularity":0.2435,"profile_path":"/3aYh8VEyvNB4Fj1OwAtty9bwMUv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"52fe4d4d9251416c75136a21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Meek","original_name":"Donald Meek","popularity":0.2737,"profile_path":"/6TTBTlpHK6QG2i8T596LZbwvmJN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gramp Smith","credit_id":"52fe4d4d9251416c75136a25","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gallaudet","original_name":"John Gallaudet","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/qEigby6hgzB4DzfXqRh4S3zpJ6D.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"J.
