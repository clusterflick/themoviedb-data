Levy's killer was Ayat al-Akhras, also 17, a schoolgirl from a Palestinian refugee camp several miles away. The two young women looked unbelievably alike. TO DIE IN JERUSALEM unabashedly explores the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through the personal loss of two families. The film's most revealing moment is in an emotionally charged meeting between the mothers of the girls, presenting the most current reflection of the conflict as seen thru their eyes.","popularity":0.3637,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14913,"logo_path":null,"name":"EJH Produtions","origin_country":""},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Priddy Brothers","origin_country":""},{"id":14911,"logo_path":null,"name":"kNow Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2007-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Die in Jerusalem","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Gyász Jeruzsálemben","type":"TV title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Pethainontas stin Ierousalim","type":"TV title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilla Medalia","original_name":"Hilla Medalia","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/68lHnt3NabSSIV42xDQhFfGhvs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d4e9251416c75136cd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilla Medalia","original_name":"Hilla Medalia","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/68lHnt3NabSSIV42xDQhFfGhvs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d4e9251416c75136cdd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0906091","wikidata_id":"Q7810906","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":190763,"name":"suicide bomber"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TO DIE IN JERUSALEM Trailer","key":"GT5nasvAGNI","published_at":"2010-04-21T20:06:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec70bc3a368544800a795"}]}}}
