The newsboy is hired by Elmer Éclair (played by Lane's younger brother, Walter Lupino) to impersonate the Duke for unstated reasons, and to attend a house party at the Smalls (a last name that leads to several puns) in the Duke's stead. Éclair warns the newsboy to stay away from the girl, as she is his finance. The newsboy is somewhat at sea at the elaborate dinner being confused by the multitude of silverware. He begins to tell a story about lion hunting and there is further mayhem with flying food.","popularity":0.1911,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howdy Duke","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lupino Lane","original_name":"Lupino Lane","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/wFroJOcJqZE8uQQMyaBSc1Zd9se.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Duke of Worcestershire / Newsboy White","credit_id":"52fe4d619251416c751394cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Lupino","original_name":"Wallace Lupino","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/wuFbVhADjY6AxWqeseEKjBF3YRM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Elmer Eclair","credit_id":"52fe4d619251416c751394d3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Taurog","original_name":"Norman Taurog","popularity":0.2086,"profile_path":"/3xm70GFmrRxKAWezI6OEHR8vEEe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d619251416c751394cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016983","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
