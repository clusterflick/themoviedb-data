The husband, although saved from drowning, loses his memory. A child is on the way, and soon a daughter is born to his wife. We watch the passage of time, as his daughter matures and his wife ages. The daughter becomes a lovely young woman, herself ready for marriage. One day on the beach, the familiarity of the sea and the surroundings triggers a return of her father's memory, and we are reminded that although people age and change, the sea and the ways of the fisherfolk remain eternal.","popularity":0.8486,"poster_path":"/pjOcOyNwhgpL3lfVu0WT3EfIQp4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unchanging Sea","video":false,"vote_average":6.368,"vote_count":34,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur V.
