The movie follows several teams to the world's first zero-emissions grand prix on the Isle of Man – the most demanding and deadly circuit on the planet – in 2009 and on their return in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  For the visionaries, it's history. For the petrol-heads it's blasphemy. What's racing without the sound and fury of internal combustion engines? CHARGE is about the future. It's about change. It's about the dream of a clean, green world. It's about the dream of winning.","popularity":0.6159,"poster_path":"/6ubEhBvsdDr8wWIYrzoqI23kFhy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charge
