Chronicling a young sailor's descent into a murky, treacherous underworld of pimps and thieves, after having encountered a Louise Brooks lookalike at a fairground and missed his departing boat, it's a lively moral fable that delights in vivid visual effects and quirky characterisations. If the plot occasionally reveals gaping holes, and the tacked-on ending urging the clearance of the Leningrad slums seems to be rather gratuitous, there's enough going on to keep one attentive and amused.","popularity":0.3918,"poster_path":"/6dsHIj6On95wd1sFaualmvBPwnJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leningradkino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1926-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Чертово Колесо","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Chyortovo koleso","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyudmila Semyonova","original_name":"Lyudmila Semyonova","popularity":0.0514,"profile_path":"/bXTHH165KxjyRwOXud4hkhDnCHF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Valya","credit_id":"5bafca9ac3a36814dd004449","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pyotr Sobolevsky","original_name":"Пётр Соболевский","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/urytNZueqCXcO3pj65hxyPUFJAv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vanya Shorin","credit_id":"5bafcaa40e0a263a05004a04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1540569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Gal","original_name":"Emil Gal","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/ngqGd7TSRYKDYWC150jrnaGSmoE.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Vaudeville Performer","credit_id":"626bcedec56d2d11b0e09a77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":624719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Gerasimov","original_name":"Сергей Герасимов","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":"/gC2I7YQPAKBwNkHVWWIF4nQOH75.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Man The Question","credit_id":"5bafcacf92514120400042bd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1869238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Kostrichkin","original_name":"Andrei Kostrichkin","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/jlIHryx7QnUeuKHuonR8wRcnJuj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Drummer","credit_id":"5bafcad80e0a263a05004a82","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yanina Zheymo","original_name":"Янина Жеймо","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":"/t9jsZSVbqsmlGWX8dhSpC5iuo8X.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"626bb209e3fa2f0a21ddc3c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Tserep","original_name":"Antonio Tserep","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tavern Owner","credit_id":"5bafcab50e0a263a170047d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"N.
