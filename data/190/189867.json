The sense of masterful timing and rhythm, the easy and natural -- though patently Fischinger-esque -- character traits of the subjects, and the smooth precision of both line and movement are all present already. Unique is the black-silhouetted, semi-cartoon characters (not nearly as rigidly self-contained as Lotte Reiniger's cut-out forms) which seem to adhere to no physical limitations whatsoever. Morphing into shapes, structures, objects, patterns, and even one another, as though they were made of pure mercury and set to music. As for the \"story\", it's rather non-sensical, and certainly silly, but also has a slightly dark and devious tinge to it as well; men becoming monsters, uncontrollable shape-shifting and the constant, almost desperate movement.","popularity":0.0876,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1927-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How very strange - as if the world were drunk!","title":"Spiritual Constructions","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Fischinger","original_name":"Oskar Fischinger","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/6NjYxPvqwubzilB9nOlkm1H9ipx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d639251416c751399a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0018371","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":184392,"name":"psychedelic"},{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
