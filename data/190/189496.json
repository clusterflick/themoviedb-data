The strike that followed went for thirteen months and was vigorously and violently opposed by mill owners and police authorities. This was not an uncommon consequence of striking, and strikers were often fired upon throughout the early Twentieth Century by both police forces and the National Guard as was demonstrated in the modern section of D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE (1916) and many other films of the time. THE PASSAIC TEXTILE STRIKE was made by the strikers' Relief Committee to not only show what was happening on the picket lines but to also provide much needed funds for the relief of strikers and their families.","popularity":0.3411,"poster_path":"/dHoSLQp51HU45V5pfk5rPp7SOPD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120380,"logo_path":null,"name":"S.
