On the way, he meets a sweet lady and they hit it off well. However, they don't realize that both are coming to visit relatives who are in the middle of a serious feud. Instead of a warm welcome, her kin tries to blow his butt off and he is forced to make a run for it. Unfortunately, his relatives don't seem much nicer, as they treat him rather poorly to say the least!","popularity":0.1807,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet the Folks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmie Adams","original_name":"Jimmie Adams","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/kzqfGsjKa50hPdhZYbvV72yYN4b.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"James Pettingill","credit_id":"52fe4d639251416c75139911","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d639251416c75139907","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert P.
