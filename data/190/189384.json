His career catapulted with 1993's Lucky Man, one of Koz' slickest and most commercial releases (which is not a bad thing by any means) to date. The album has an undeniably crisp and clean feel, akin to the color schemes used in the artwork. The musical styles range from funky and peppy, as in the opening \"Shakin' the Shack,\" \"Silverlining,\" and the evergreen \"You Make Me Smile,\" to tender and sweet, as in \"Faces of the Heart,\" \"Lucky Man,\" and \"Tender Is the Night,\" which features hypnotic vocals courtesy of Phil Perry. Recorded May 18. 1991. Dave Koz on Sax, Phil Perry on Vocal. Band was Don Boyette - Bass, Mark Shulman - Drums, Carl Burnett - Guitar, Don Wyatt - Keyboards, Kevin Richard - Percussion, Joyce Imbesi - Keyboards, Leslie Smith, Anita Sherman & Delta Dickerson - Backup Vocalist","popularity":0.2851,"poster_path":"/icjGqDzmusYSwsNJrWZY3aSOaGr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7150,"logo_path":"/6wf9IWd1MKS3UR5cKVj5MMcyZcQ.png","name":"Capitol Records","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pioneer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dave Koz & Phil Perry: Live at the Strand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dave Koz and Phil Perry: Live at the Strand Redondo Beach","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":184120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Koz","original_name":"Dave Koz","popularity":0.1643,"profile_path":"/pGDnuCR09EqyDG82zdijbqwLueG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea6eb26db72c00026beec4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Perry","original_name":"Phil Perry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4YUA82W4yELLd5B4kf1BsgrvvZv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea6eb355a4690001f12f5a2","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.691,"height":1107,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/icjGqDzmusYSwsNJrWZY3aSOaGr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":765},{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f1EUpnagb8lqgYCqKLJQjwlOlBT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2002-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Laserdisc","release_date":"1992-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
