He's an Arabic-speaking young man working the night shift at a laundromat and dry cleaners somewhere in the United States. In the aftermath of 9/11, they wash U.S. flags for free. He says they get six or seven per day. He tells us about Napoleon's two wives: Marie Louise for an heir, Josephine for love. Aadid likes Adela, his co-worker. She's his Josephine. We watch Aadid and Adela hand wash the flags and put them in dryers. They fold them. They dance. They stand side by side outside the door of the laundromat looking at the dawn. Will this companionship become something more?","popularity":0.3097,"poster_path":"/hHPX3s5s4SF19wnRiCd9WC05iyr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196759,"logo_path":"/uDnqdLmzK7fZ2xR3UGUqGT7Z4gC.png","name":"Florida State University College of Motion Picture Arts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Josephine","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basel Hamdan","original_name":"Basel Hamdan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aadid","credit_id":"52fe4d659251416c75139d35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saba Shariat","original_name":"Saba Shariat","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Adela","credit_id":"5869a70a9251414e7a0120a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Levi","original_name":"Marc Levi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Customer","credit_id":"5869a7299251414e7a0120b6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Jenkins","original_name":"Barry Jenkins","popularity":0.4499,"profile_path":"/6nld5eQwiJmuLmyesk4EUeCaoo3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d659251416c75139d31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":960350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Laxton","original_name":"James Laxton","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/wD83C5pD7eHdfULlS6pFlWnRs4O.jpg","credit_id":"58696b2c9251414e7500f06f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takia Cameron","original_name":"Takia Cameron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5869a74ec3a3680f4b012182","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1731178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jai Tiggett","original_name":"Jai Tiggett","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5869a6989251414e820124d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darren P.
