And she quickly hooks up with a male partner in crime, in this case a Gentleman Crook played by perpetually grinning Creighton Hale. Mabel seems a little livelier in this film than in some of her other late works. In the very first scene we find her hitch-hiking, and she's forced to make a mad dash for cover when Hale's car nearly hits her. Soon they team up and crash a swanky party in a mansion to steal a jewel from the host's safe.","popularity":0.5104,"poster_path":"/p5fH61sX6HgwCRP28RRSEUyPbMM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Should Men Walk Home?","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Female Comedies - Sollten MÃ¤nner nach Hause laufen?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Girl Bandit","credit_id":"52fe4d619251416c75139441","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Creighton Hale","original_name":"Creighton Hale","popularity":0.2002,"profile_path":"/7rTJcSkHJ77iU62HXcL8NZa6gth.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Gentleman Crook","credit_id":"52fe4d619251416c75139445","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Pallette","original_name":"Eugene Pallette","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/y3n1c9qjmJzGeZWihwm0QWlmDoR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Detective, Intelligence Bureau","credit_id":"52fe4d619251416c75139449","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":1.0454,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Party Guest at Punch Bowl","credit_id":"52fe4d619251416c7513944d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William A.
