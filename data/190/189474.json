The cartoon begins as Koko the Clown emerges from an inkwell-- an iconic image for animation buffs --and then steps over to a chalkboard to draw an orchestra. The band, “Koko's Glee Club,” marches to a nearby cinema (accompanied by a dog who beats cymbals with his tail) where they lead the audience in the title song.","popularity":0.2983,"poster_path":"/u6DLwc9U7vuNprkxORZlY7Kj4cT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Out of the Inkwell Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp the Boys Are Marching","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d5b9251416c75138701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"56c38cd9c3a3684d27000792","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":606084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Fleischer","original_name":"Max Fleischer","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/m4i8FwtAeh3u1J01cdFsCf0G6VB.jpg","credit_id":"56e3276a9251416d370008ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0141912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1028,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u6DLwc9U7vuNprkxORZlY7Kj4cT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":685}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161153,"name":"sing-along"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
