In this film, Buttgereit himself plays Captain Berlin in a yellow jumpsuit with red briefs worn on the outside, capped off by a Spiderman mask and a repurposed flag worn as a cape. Clearly the product of a punk sensibility slamming head-on into a love of the 1960s \"Batman\" teevee show. The film is funny to watch but low on stuff like \"production values,\" \"plot,\" and \"sense.\"","popularity":0.0941,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captain Berlin - Retter der Welt","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bela B.","original_name":"Bela B.","popularity":0.3305,"profile_path":"/hSeyOuRSJoNVfmVpEyQjoR6mqGY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ferngesteuerter Mutant","credit_id":"5bd076c0c3a368662202d413","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Synthetic","original_name":"Peter Synthetic","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mister Synth","credit_id":"5bd076f60e0a266238033bf8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Buttgereit","original_name":"Jörg Buttgereit","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/7mWcREHlwk3ZoAO70j1sErU8ke9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Captain Berlin","credit_id":"5bd0770d0e0a266245032f51","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Buttgereit","original_name":"Jörg Buttgereit","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/7mWcREHlwk3ZoAO70j1sErU8ke9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d5a9251416c751384ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0269048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cAFN9m9VwvoBsZnBVW3oaNDWl3N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
