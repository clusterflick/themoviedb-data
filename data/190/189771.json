Mabel works in a tailor shop, pressing clothes and dreaming of a better life. We're told that she's taken a lot of bumps in life and doesn't know where the next bump is coming from, which sounds uncomfortably close to the leading lady's real-life situation. Her boss is Jimmy Finlayson, but instead of playing the expected sourpuss Finn is quite benign here, and doesn't even punish Mabel when she accidentally sets his toupee on fire.","popularity":0.2965,"poster_path":"/z7P2AX1bL7V0gnfFOoc2KsNAZqR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anything Once!","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Little Girl","credit_id":"52fe4d629251416c75139685","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Finlayson","original_name":"James Finlayson","popularity":0.3658,"profile_path":"/mKzmqNW32JgFYICiQfEFK5m8b8s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mabel's Boss","credit_id":"52fe4d629251416c75139689","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Davidson","original_name":"Max Davidson","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/yo57wZr0Fx0hyklCf0ykqPIOqVU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Granville","credit_id":"52fe4d629251416c7513968d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore von Eltz","original_name":"Theodore von Eltz","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/nq3mPGbn5iqyojutuUam8NXil5A.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Prince Chevalier","credit_id":"52fe4d629251416c75139691","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"F.
