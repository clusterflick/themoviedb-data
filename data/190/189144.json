After having the everyday breakfast Walter makes the last hay of the summer when he listens to the news on his tractor radio that a gigantic asteroid is approaching the earth in a great speed. Unfortunately, all attempts to avert the total destruction of mankind within 16 hours are in vain. He is uncertain how to tell his wife and decides for his own sake to conceal the end of the world from her. Trapped by his own lie Walter gradually remembers his almost forgotten love for his wife and is determined to celebrate the nicest last day on earth for her.","popularity":0.1081,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14265,"logo_path":"/v1WpUx7HbExqOplFJ0BJnigWb2S.png","name":"bildundtonfabrik","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":14266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filoufilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Armadingen","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1170565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Graf","original_name":"Karin Graf","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Helga","credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c75137327","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gernot Hertel","original_name":"Gernot Hertel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Walter","credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c7513732b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170562,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philipp Kässbohrer","original_name":"Philipp Käßbohrer","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c75137311","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170562,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philipp Kässbohrer","original_name":"Philipp Käßbohrer","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c75137317","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170563,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Krauslach","original_name":"Thomas Krauslach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c7513731d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthias Schulz","original_name":"Matthias Schulz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c75137323","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1815597","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
