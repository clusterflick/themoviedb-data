Shanna Strackbein didn’t always know hers, but that all changed when her Papaw, Dewey Holden, pulled out an old box of slides that gave a window into his past she’d only glimpsed before. Spurred on by this discovery, she asked her grandfather to tell more as she leafed through dusty albums in an earnest search to learn the rest of the story. Anchored follows her quest, tracing God’s faithfulness in one family’s life over five generations.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3RbCfrvRgZVg8BudmwB8BBm0Ug9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A True Story of God's Faithfulness Over Five Generations","title":"Anchored: A Grandfather's Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1238,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3RbCfrvRgZVg8BudmwB8BBm0Ug9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":874}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
