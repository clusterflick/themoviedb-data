A dancer and a singer perform a duet with Taeuber’s marionettes and revive Dada as a collective art – still fresh and experimental after 100 years of its appearance.  The masking of dancer and singer bring to mind the courage of Sophie Taeuber. Despite the threat of dismissal from the School of Applied Arts she continued performing as a dadaist – henceforth, dancing with mask and pseudonym.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Dada - King Deer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505945,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anka Schmid","original_name":"Anka Schmid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abc11799251411e9a01983b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5461270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurn Film Festival","release_date":"2016-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
