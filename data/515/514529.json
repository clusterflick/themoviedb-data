He is just starting to doze when the \"dripping\" noise of a leaky kitchen faucet awakens him. At first, he tries to ignore the problem by counting sheep (but the sheep turn into drips). He then tries to drown out the noise but this doesn't work either. Determined to stop the dripping, the dog puts a sponge in the sink to absorb the water. It absorbs too much water and expands tenfold. He then tries turning the faucet upside down. It \"drips\" upside down to the ceiling! He tries stopping it up with a cork but the tap inflates and spews it back out. Finally, the dog has had enough and pulls at the faucet until he's uprooted the plumbing of nearly the entire street! At last, the dog can get to sleep, his house on top of a water geyser!","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malice in Slumberland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alec Geiss","original_name":"Alec Geiss","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aba761f9251411ea7002254","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
