For five decades, St. Louis fielded a second professional team - the St. Louis Browns. The Browns tendency to be remembered as a mere punchline has obscured their place in history, but their story is more than their reputation would suggest. It's the story of what could have been but never was. Of baseball legends lost to time. Of glorious gimmicks. As a beloved team turned fraternity of failure. This is the story of a team that found its place in history by losing its home. It's a story forgotten no more.","popularity":0.8135,"poster_path":"/oxfedyhLwTfBqOITwsNHZxTtPIk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102549,"logo_path":null,"name":"HLK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Visitors in their hometown.","title":"The Saint Louis Browns: The Team That Baseball Forgot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Hamm","original_name":"Jon Hamm","popularity":3.1045,"profile_path":"/mrXE5fZbEDPc7BEE5G21J6qrwzi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ab7facec3a3680a3e021936","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matt Telthorst","original_name":"Matt Telthorst","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fb5bc3a3680a2b01f228","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007460,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nathan Huber","original_name":"Nathan Huber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fbadc3a3680a3e021a57","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007455,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Harris","original_name":"Bob Harris","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fb24925141395e01ff6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007464,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Keith Lutker","original_name":"Keith Lutker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fbd70e0a261feb020c5b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Brule","original_name":"Amanda Brule","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fb6dc3a3680a3e0219fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007458,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Karlovic","original_name":"Eric Karlovic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fb9cc3a3680a28022978","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007462,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elise Moore","original_name":"Elise Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fbc0925141395802065d","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Tolliver","original_name":"Justin Tolliver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7fb01c3a3680a280228b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8119304","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.732,"height":2211,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oxfedyhLwTfBqOITwsNHZxTtPIk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1618}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":167951,"name":"st. louis, missouri"},{"id":243124,"name":"st. louis browns"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The St. Louis Browns: The Team that Baseball Forgot | Promo","key":"d75TuR5bFWU","published_at":"2018-02-28T14:06:27.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5ab7fc65925141395201fe70"}]}}}
