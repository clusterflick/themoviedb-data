In solitary confinement for the last 25 years, Kenneth has pushed back the walls of his cell to become a painter, a poet, the founder of a non-profit, and an art event organizer - while fighting at the same time for justice. At age 18, Kenneth Reams was convicted for capital murder without firing a bullet. He became the youngest inmate on Arkansas death row. Alongside art, the film shows how love can cross barbed wire and the length of an ocean in Kenneth's love for Isabelle, a French artist who wants to become his wife.","popularity":0.4354,"poster_path":"/k6l3wmAeB9GKfI9fGYbGGaNJmYU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85595,"logo_path":"/b7WeslTaEl82WgOywyfWMDwXkWX.png","name":"Intermezzo Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Men","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Reams","original_name":"Kenneth Reams","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kenneth Reams","credit_id":"5d921d6539a1a6000e1f4eae","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Acosta","original_name":"Ana Acosta","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d921e157f4f210018df982a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422161,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karim Amin","original_name":"Karim Amin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d921df98e8702000f05bc85","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Frédérique Widmann","original_name":"Anne-Frédérique Widmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d921d82e1ad790018591cb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422159,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Costanza Francavilla","original_name":"Costanza Francavilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d921de0d4a68b0021a9b736","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162779,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolas Binggeli","original_name":"Nicolas Binggeli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d921e2fd4a68b000fa9b879","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7999994","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k6l3wmAeB9GKfI9fGYbGGaNJmYU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5d19jjbHNvwVVhpbSWJzXbpssAf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":1563,"name":"prisoner"},{"id":6089,"name":"freedom"},{"id":222519,"name":"legal system"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FREE MEN (2018)","key":"ccTZlkhBKLQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-08T16:41:28.000Z","id":"5d921ef68e8702000f05bf51"}]}}}
