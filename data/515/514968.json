Three grandsons embark an anarchic journey into the past – a complex road movie about intergenerational dialogue in Great Britain, Germany and Hungary. Granny Project is a seven-year-long investigation of three young men coming to terms with their heritage through the extraordinary lives of their grandmothers: an English spy, a dancer from Nazi Germany and a Hungarian communist Holocaust survivor. The film deals with classic values and taboo-like historical topics, and the method used is equally important as it gives an insight to the zeitgeist of the young today.","popularity":0.2949,"poster_path":"/6DUzObTPzmIfx7ZESrM3T9jE2Me.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gallivant Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Granny Project","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Nagyi Projekt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Granny Project","type":"Netflix title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779321,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ruben Woodin Dechamps","original_name":"Ruben Woodin Dechamps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abd2022c3a3684362029d4e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"László Kántor","original_name":"László Kántor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abd20029251411ea002950c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196265,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Albert Márkos","original_name":"Albert Márkos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abd203e0e0a2609de02af4f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779321,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ruben Woodin Dechamps","original_name":"Ruben Woodin Dechamps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abd202ac3a368435c02c085","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2012880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bálint Révész","original_name":"Bálint Révész","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac0f01a0e0a264a4e0480c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5687816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"GrannyProject","instagram_id":"gallivantfilm","twitter_id":"gallivantfilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7uajNREVL8FeFOg5KZ8OeXEcf7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zzPBAbP8xvNI5hwhNoHQG8DYReJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.048,"height":418,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m2HvgjnEykq4uop0udL8EOoLVyb.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1274},{"aspect_ratio":2.731,"height":468,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/8hu7GaN7hxyS1U5WMWcLnzKaw3d.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1278}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6DUzObTPzmIfx7ZESrM3T9jE2Me.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11933,"name":"conflict"},{"id":162365,"name":"military"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOCUSPACE","release_date":"2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Granny Project / Trailer","key":"7ZqkcFNV_kU","published_at":"2018-02-24T01:39:06.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5ac0f1929251416018043970"}]}}}
