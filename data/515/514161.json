Without a script, pure chance, any corner. He seeks total objectivity and little by little a series of small everyday stories begin to take shape. He is very sure of his idea, but at the same time very close to it. Thus, without knowing it, he is putting the camera where it should not. What if someone else was waiting for those images to put together \"another movie\" in which Ulysses ended up being responsible for a crime? A story of dense and dreamlike air, of suspense and seduction.","popularity":0.0988,"poster_path":"/vroKa9vwIllmeaJ27ZeCOSznOiD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clase B Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2016-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punto ciego","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álvaro Teruel","original_name":"Álvaro Teruel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ulises","credit_id":"5ab858050e0a261fe50284c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corine Fonrouge","original_name":"Corine Fonrouge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"5eba212d0cb3350021cfacf0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Longhi","original_name":"Luis Longhi","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/gquh3q5ljPtcUhkEl44vVK1A6i3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"5eba2145bbe1dd00228373b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1676724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Ferrer","original_name":"Adriana Ferrer","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/kOh2Eq1sX0Iq6BjoyH6O4MIjvaa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Insp.
