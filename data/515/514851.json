There is a book entitled \"How I Will Be Rich, the Idea Publishing Company\" for a \"great success\". Well, if you have the right luck to sell your Boldizsár, you already have a high-ranking bookstore job. His good or bad fate brings him to the Counts of Nyulassy. But in vain, enthusiasm, if there is a lack of fitness. The Nyulassy family, wishing to maintain the semblance of wealth, completely devastates it. The Countess only takes his book and gets his money on a card, Count Fricie does a little more: steals and sells Boldizsár's car. Countess Dora even exceeds this.","popularity":0.1178,"poster_path":"/gpC0zzQLBtXgasHQqXfBAyX7io6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1942-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A tökéletes család","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Perfect Family","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Muráti","original_name":"Lili Muráti","popularity":0.1457,"profile_path":"/3uRevZFk6cGxxviShppLBbPIyXR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nyulassy Dóra","credit_id":"5e79f3a0c8a2d400172407c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piri Vaszary","original_name":"Piri Vaszary","popularity":0.1972,"profile_path":"/F5fh13f9vYIQR5vgSgDN9fxMOt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nyulassyné, Melinda","credit_id":"5abc2d2fc3a368435f01a1c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margit Zsilley","original_name":"Margit Zsilley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pipi baronessz, Szitai húga","credit_id":"5abc2d3dc3a368437901c8e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miklós Hajmássy","original_name":"Miklós Hajmássy","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Szabó Boldizsár, könyvügynök","credit_id":"5abc2d4e9251411e9201b6d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyula Csortos","original_name":"Gyula Csortos","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":"/t23OVv70jnm7gRN0sGCakk2cvvc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nyulassy János gróf","credit_id":"5e7a03c2a055ef0014317be9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2010086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"László Sipos","original_name":"László Sipos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abc2cec9251411ea701a5cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0035484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.731,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/gpC0zzQLBtXgasHQqXfBAyX7io6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":548}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
