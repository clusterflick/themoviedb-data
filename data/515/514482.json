Drawing on archive footage, animations, movie excerpts and interviews with Havana residents, eyewitnesses and experts, Habaneros runs through key moments in the city’s modern history, from the abolition of slavery at the end of the 19th century to the Spanish–American War, and from the dictatorship of General Batista to the revolution of Fidel Castro. The film concludes by wondering what the future holds. Many Havana locals are encouraged by President Obama’s relaxation of sanctions, but much uncertainty remains.","popularity":0.2402,"poster_path":"/nvhJ96dm8jvzmXB1BNC4iKjxnDJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Essential Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":113253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polite Storm","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":10380,"logo_path":"/nAOapNY0va7a1nt4ZfQYIH5jRq2.png","name":"Nitrate Film","origin_country":""},{"id":148894,"logo_path":"/5an0hahm40POymfNsytcxyqr6lG.png","name":"Splice Post","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habaneros","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Havana","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Temple","original_name":"Julien Temple","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":"/hdaEOb1CAsH4vXWTUHCUvnYLJv0.jpg","credit_id":"5aba34b09251414d2b012d08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1526055,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Organ","original_name":"Steve Organ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe28e9ac616ac003bd4ba0c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2905774,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Caroline Richards","original_name":"Caroline Richards","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe28eb10d417e003e4c640e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2905775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Conway","original_name":"Richard Conway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe28ed170309f003f7e2057","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125208,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew J.
