Earthsatz tries to amplify the cold and oppressive poetry generated by this « pocket world », where life doesn’t exist and particules are replaced by pixels. Maybe we should try to contemplate it for what it really is: a fictional universe that mimics the one we are living in, developing its own autonomy. With photogrammetry, we scanned some parts of the Google-generated world. We built 3D landscapes from them and tried to highlight their surreal caracteristics, playing with mysterious lights, impossible distortions and moving points of view. \"Earthsatz\" is a ride in this corrupted world, celebrating all its fictional, articificial and irrational aspects.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dkYJy458XfeQkwTUDI7mgeMK7vY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earthsatz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2733808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Lafanechère","original_name":"Pierre Lafanechère","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2c6f2822df2e00373d5dc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2733807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Cote","original_name":"Dylan Cote","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2c6f0f9c24fc0037a48f8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dkYJy458XfeQkwTUDI7mgeMK7vY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Besides the Screen","release_date":"2020-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Harddiskmuseum","release_date":"2020-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
