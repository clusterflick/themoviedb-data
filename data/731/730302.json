For the 14-year-old Gau Ban, it is time once again to return to the grave of his parents, murdered by bandits when he was just ten. In the company of his adoptive sister Elle Lagu, Gau quickly comes to realize that his journey is more than a pilgrimage, and that his combat abilities as a student of the Karuda School of Martial Arts are about to be pushed to the breaking point!
