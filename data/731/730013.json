Who Farted? suggests that understanding our place in nature is essential to our continued existence as a species. If we can’t deal with our own flatulence, how can we hope to comprehend the looming climate catastrophe?  Are farts malevolent? Disgusting? Beneficial? Hilarious? What exactly is a fart? And how much does animal flatulence truly contribute to runaway climate change?  From antiquity’s first fart joke to the ubiquitous whoopee cushion, the act of flatus both amuses and dismays... and now may contribute to civilization’s demise. Who Farted? is a frightening, illuminating, and funny journey through the absurd reality of 21st Century human survival.","popularity":0.2917,"poster_path":"/eiKqb2Vi2s0fQxKBAxvqUDFxYXN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syndicado","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Farts are funny!","title":"Who Farted?","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Nerenberg","original_name":"Albert Nerenberg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66cc5c4842ee2ef18748c9c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Oldfield","original_name":"Paul Oldfield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66cc5c55503135ed14168fd2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Silver","original_name":"Matthew Silver","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66cc5c67d6c9c439b31d738d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043358,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Pellerin","original_name":"Daniel Pellerin","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc5dcbbac98c192b6eb083","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nik Sheehan","original_name":"Nik Sheehan","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc5b6010c5e752440d56a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Geordie Trifa","original_name":"Geordie Trifa","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc5d7549094360193edbdf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Fassbender","original_name":"Chris Fassbender","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc5d876287514bd52d7888","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Nerenberg","original_name":"Albert Nerenberg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc5b4d731aded63bb34a39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10481862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eiKqb2Vi2s0fQxKBAxvqUDFxYXN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":325500,"name":"farts"},{"id":326180,"name":"farting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
