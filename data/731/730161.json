She has dreams of a park that are both premonitions of the future and a site at which its absence is played out. An escalating sense of timelessness collapses Aune's two realities, as her body takes on significance as a cipher for a larger process of dismemberment. A love story turns into a film about sex, death and the economy. Filmed in large part in Victoria Park, London, the film is a loose adaptation of 1896 novel Aune by Finnish writer Immi Hellen.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aune, or On Effective Demise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Harlyn","original_name":"Hanna Harlyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f2a2ce84e674200337d2c2c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maija Timonen","original_name":"Maija Timonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2a2cfb2d8ef30038e38cc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maija Timonen","original_name":"Maija Timonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2a2d072d8ef3791fd60b36","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3072416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
