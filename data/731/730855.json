This 20-minute documentary film highlights the life of an indigenous Ngabe farmer in Panama and his unconditional devotion to this so-called \"superfood.\" The film threads together the themes of neoliberal ideology, human rights, and the economics of the chocolate industry. While the demand for chocolate in developed nations continues to raise, the farmers in developing countries, like Panama, are rarely awarded the economic incentive promised to them.  The film utilizes cinema verite techniques with candid interviews. Most of the film hinges on intimate shots in personal working and living space within a small Ngabe community in the Bocas del Toro region of Panama.","popularity":0.0595,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75306,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Day Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Dark Side of Chocolate Production in Latin America","title":"El Cacao: The Challenge of Fair Trade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Aguilar","original_name":"Michelle Aguilar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2d723f596a910036fb4d1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":269507,"name":"el cacao"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El Cacao -The Challenge of Fair Trade","key":"_NZfoqhU9lw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-04-30T14:39:17.000Z","id":"5f2d738d46e75f003807d7a4"}]}}}
