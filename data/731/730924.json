They represent by far the largest religious group and should not be underestimated politically as voters. They take the Bible literally and believe that God created the world in six days, that the world only existed for 6,000 years, and they dismiss scientific knowledge as lies. They fear Muslims and atheists, homosexuality and permissive life. Alcohol, abortion and sex before marriage are taboo. In large parts of the United States, secularism, the separation of church and state, are being removed more and more. The filmmakers of the documentary give a frightening insight into a strange world and show a supposedly modern country, in which large parts of the population have a level of intellectual development as in the Middle Ages and are as reactionary in their worldview as in Islamist theocracies.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/tPWK6rIcDGB9mRtHcijNufmT1xO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ligne de Front","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God Bless America: The Power of Religion in the United States","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2755509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Fournier","original_name":"Sarah Fournier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f461e6571f0950035848740","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12803688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c6a7tzpqivMBmVXWoqJwvb0pggz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r1a7oWNqNfuI5wZwLweYkzYHwhR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tPWK6rIcDGB9mRtHcijNufmT1xO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
