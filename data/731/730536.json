The footage is almost as impressive as the feat of engineering it captures. For many years our curators believed our Mutoscope rolls were slightly shrunken 70mm film, but they were actually shot on Biograph’s proprietary 68mm stock. Formats like Biograph’s 68mm and Fox’s 70mm Grandeur are of particular interest to researchers visiting the Film Study Center because the large image area affords stunning visual clarity and quality, especially compared to the more standard 35mm or 16mm stocks.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kVvkzpirgel2EwEJ46oKvnOprKo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Mutoskop und Biograph","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1902-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flying Train","video":false,"vote_average":7.654,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0390011","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dIINBMIpLsPX55nasMyb9O9mIhl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kVvkzpirgel2EwEJ46oKvnOprKo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tBa99sXaZnIuSMvIMytemT3DaCT.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1902-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Flying Train (1902) | MoMA FILM VAULT SUMMER CAMP","key":"2Ud1aZFE0fU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-09T15:32:09.000Z","id":"5f33a8dda3e4ba0033cec59d"}]}}}
