He seeks another point of view, especially an end, and he relies on the reactions of the actors to invent a new resolution of his history, in a country suddenly raised by a wave of disputes. During the projection of the film, the debate takes place: what is the place of art creation in Algeria today? How to create something without confronting censorship? How to resist ? By making movies or walking in streets towards a new revolution? Two stories intertwine, fiction and reality? A new vision of the Algerian youth of today in full political and artistic questioning.","popularity":0.1337,"poster_path":"/rOIW1VYKWlS6qiTHHds6oYJfVQZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Normal!","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adila Bendimerad","original_name":"Adila Bendimerad","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/6ZIecXV7PJyrszqYAQIUrbrWHq6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amina","credit_id":"67852e44bd793c03544ed1c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1020542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nabil Asli","original_name":"Nabil Asli","popularity":0.6964,"profile_path":"/oNliw17ZT2Bn3R4mEFhzgT6NcKT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nabil","credit_id":"67852e86218fd57acf4f4225","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3807583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Lachter","original_name":"Mina Lachter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mina","credit_id":"67852e9394fc87ef487b3622","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nouha Matlouti","original_name":"Nouha Matlouti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lamia","credit_id":"67852ea694fc87ef487b362d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadjib Oulebsir","original_name":"Nadjib Oulebsir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fouzi","credit_id":"67852eba94fc87ef487b3633","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merzak Allouache","original_name":"Merzak Allouache","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/mUCtwUBJsg0nn3DXVpQeJ5UHfeF.jpg","credit_id":"5f2a75952d8ef30038e56285","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2292839","wikidata_id":"Q3343730","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rOIW1VYKWlS6qiTHHds6oYJfVQZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
