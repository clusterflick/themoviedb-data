The story begins in Toronto, where we learn about his typical Canadian childhood, then moves onto his teenage experience with the Ontario Hockey Leagueâ€™s (OHL) Sarnia Sting. During his time in the OHL, Rich developed a crippling addiction to drugs and alcohol, which threatened to derail both his personal life and professional career. Shortly after debuting in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings, Rich made the choice to get sober, embarking on a wild journey to the rehab clinic back home in Canada, from his brother's dormitory in Worcester, Massachusetts. Sober for over ten years, the viewer learns how Rich leads a fascinating life off the ice, and has become a mentor to many players in the NHL, now in the twilight of his career playing for his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs.","popularity":0.3308,"poster_path":"/atKp5s2wpaujbPuQZte6rnB9G2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Upper Canada Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hi, My Name is Dicky","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Clune","original_name":"Rich Clune","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2b03f1fab3fa0035fcae3f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Prestidge","original_name":"Taylor Prestidge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b0458a698cf0032548200","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haris Usanovic","original_name":"Haris Usanovic","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b0467fab3fa0035fcb05d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Prestidge","original_name":"Taylor Prestidge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b04774b6d9d0034863ae8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haris Usanovic","original_name":"Haris Usanovic","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b04fb45819900315920d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732522,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Best Challinor","original_name":"John Best Challinor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b04ecd132d600388ca70f","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732522,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Best Challinor","original_name":"John Best Challinor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b04983e09f3003526245b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Prestidge","original_name":"Taylor Prestidge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b04aff1759c003788c11c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732524,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caitlyn Sud","original_name":"Caitlyn Sud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2b04c6fab3fa0035fcb141","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12239858","wikidata_id":"Q104177610","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/atKp5s2wpaujbPuQZte6rnB9G2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AkZTS9qO0EBeUepBmSgRB7XTPpE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1803,"name":"drug addiction"},{"id":6483,"name":"ice hockey"},{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"},{"id":40956,"name":"recovering alcoholic"},{"id":260505,"name":"professional hockey player"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer | \"Hi, My Name is Dicky\"","key":"tduucbjqeXQ","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-04-28T04:28:55.000Z","id":"5f2b0584458199003257f798"}]}}}
