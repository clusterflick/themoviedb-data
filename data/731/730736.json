As with the Dalai Lama, Karmapa is the same soul which reincarnates in each successor to the office, who is identified by omens, portents and other signs. The Karmapa line actually pre-dates the Dalai Lama's, and their respective importance has alternated in the course of history with either the Karmapa or Dalai Lama holding precedence. Only one of the current Karmapas lives in Tibet, who is  recognized by the Dalai Lama but controlled by the Chinese government for political ends. The second Karmapa lives in New Delhi, India and was selected by a Tibetan group in exile. The film was shot in India, Nepal and Tibet and features the Dalai Lama as narrator, providing an incisive spiritual and political view of occupied Tibet.","popularity":0.468,"poster_path":"/eddbuRivk2xr4rWkwRDPusHQFK7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karmapa - Two Ways of Divinity","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Karmapa - jumaluuden kaksi tietä","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenzin Gyatso","original_name":"Tenzin Gyatso","popularity":0.162,"profile_path":"/dAtWYY56kQURZFKmdgrCTkakXTw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f2cfb5b17c44300343203be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shamar Rinpoche","original_name":"Shamar Rinpoche","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f2cfb7813af5f00347a5540","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trinley Thaye Dorje","original_name":"Trinley Thaye Dorje","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5f2cfc3cafe2240037fd61f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Coyote","original_name":"Peter Coyote","popularity":1.5648,"profile_path":"/ld3xLYTcZWjAc0bE33DONT7n9o8.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator, English version (voice)","credit_id":"5f2cfc7017c4430034320549","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esko Salminen","original_name":"Esko Salminen","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/74y98xEaOSBC5xp1vpcm9VrFGLW.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator, Finnish version (voice)","credit_id":"5f2cfc90cdbaff0036a38ed5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arto Halonen","original_name":"Arto Halonen","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2cfacf46e75f003707736b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arto Halonen","original_name":"Arto Halonen","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2cfae6a9117f0038aedcf5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2316998,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Viliam Poltikovič","original_name":"Viliam Poltikovič","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2cfaf803726400358419d5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2123846,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vesa Mäkinen","original_name":"Vesa Mäkinen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2cfb0d17c4430036314f42","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arto Halonen","original_name":"Arto Halonen","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2cfb3cafe2240035fc75d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0166236","wikidata_id":"Q14956549","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eddbuRivk2xr4rWkwRDPusHQFK7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188,"name":"buddhism"},{"id":4558,"name":"tibet"},{"id":269487,"name":"karmapa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
