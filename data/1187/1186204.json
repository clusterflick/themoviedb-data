Lex Barker embodies the flawless hero in his films and, as Old Shatterhand, becomes a role model for generations of fans. Revered in Europe, misunderstood and almost forgotten in his native America. But who was this American who rode through Yugoslavia in a leather costume for the European audience? In 1973, Lex Barker died of a heart attack on the streets of Manhattan in New York. But no one recognizes the man who was Tarzan in Hollywood. Nobody knows him or cares about that he, as Winnetou's friend, is revered as an icon in Europe. Lex Barker's European western adventures are just a footnote in American film history. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death, the documentary tells the story of one of the most beautiful men who ever flickered across Europe's cinema screens, for whom European cinema proved to be a stroke of luck and for whom a failed Hollywood career took him via Italy to Germany.","popularity":0.79,"poster_path":"/xdnZO4C0EGJ46jRbYbt5OLnreyd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140574,"logo_path":"/Anoe1ae1Kk9wm8uQbxRsQ1fSaqI.png","name":"Westend Film & TV","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lex Barker - Westernheld und Playboy","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Lex Barker - De Tarzan au playboy de westerns","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Lex Barker - Westernheld & Herzensbrecher","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Lex Barker: de Tarzán a playboy de westerns","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Lex Barker: de Tarzán a playboy de westerns","type":"alternative spelling"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lex Barker","original_name":"Lex Barker","popularity":1.0875,"profile_path":"/9Bsvemc5lCvKNJdS5bt4BEa7TFR.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self - Portrait Subject (archive footage)","credit_id":"6519e336ea84c7014efc2bad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen G.
