The friends are now 25 and living new lives: Dawson (James Van Der Beek) is in Hollywood executive-producing The Creek, obviously based on his own life and considered \"the new hit teen soap at the WB\"; Joey (Katie Holmes) is a book editor in New York with a serious beau; Jen (Michelle Williams) is a single mother; Pacey (Joshua Jackson) is the relatively respectable owner of the reborn Icehouse Restaurant; and Jack (Kerr Smith) is teaching at the high school and struggling with his relationship. A wedding brings everyone together in Capeside, but tragedy strikes, and the remaining friends are left to consider their lives and what they want to do with them. Whether or not you agree with the final choices, of course, probably depends on who you've been rooting for.","popularity":1.6479,"poster_path":"/fWplZ37q4uaa5DgfOlC3q4fhN7h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawson's Creek - The Series Finale (Extended Cut)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Van Der Beek","original_name":"James Van Der Beek","popularity":0.8913,"profile_path":"/5CzRqYzRMNevIu6rB8gUFKpsKZL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dawson Leery","credit_id":"65199c5c9d592c014261307d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Holmes","original_name":"Katie Holmes","popularity":1.9969,"profile_path":"/1o9j7xajyWILCubtElbfovu43DT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joey Potter","credit_id":"65199c6d74507d011c0d932e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Williams","original_name":"Michelle Williams","popularity":3.155,"profile_path":"/mfgKyigaQLI0NtZsaJRVlbUiMdX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jen Lindley","credit_id":"65199c85ea84c7012d67ab39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Jackson","original_name":"Joshua Jackson","popularity":1.6813,"profile_path":"/mH2a5YFd8J7upjjWwEzM75vitA2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pacey Witter","credit_id":"65199c9693bd6900acc75f8a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerr Smith","original_name":"Kerr Smith","popularity":0.9308,"profile_path":"/2XHffxdkDVhaETNi6ajSntQ40du.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jack McPhee","credit_id":"65199cb4ea84c7012d67ab4c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Busy Philipps","original_name":"Busy Philipps","popularity":1.0237,"profile_path":"/7UUe7IgetfpyhNSSpoyaC9iWF7C.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Audrey Liddell","credit_id":"65199ccaea84c700eb99c4b8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Beth Peil","original_name":"Mary Beth Peil","popularity":0.3024,"profile_path":"/dngypOKbFTd4g0frMasQp5KZFn8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Evelyn 'Grams' Ryan","credit_id":"65199d4674507d00ac4545b2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Prange","original_name":"Gregory Prange","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65199dbca199a60138b93aee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26458,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Williamson","original_name":"Kevin Williamson","popularity":0.7728,"profile_path":"/jWgZZoKBU1WFaCO5C7jpMBZ7xJs.jpg","credit_id":"65199d7b93bd6900e12e5515","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87472,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Whitmore Jr.","original_name":"James Whitmore Jr.","popularity":0.8195,"profile_path":"/g57k2R5KmUhmmTuCloNRBw38a0g.jpg","credit_id":"65199daac50ad2014dcdfa78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1219213,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maggie Friedman","original_name":"Maggie Friedman","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/AfZ4yT42u8JmXA6Wr1xVKgo9Qsg.jpg","credit_id":"65199d8b9d592c0122173f0b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8vrtU1ZwO1I7dTmb9ZVWAya6LYU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1432,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fWplZ37q4uaa5DgfOlC3q4fhN7h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1005}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
