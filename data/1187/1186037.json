Farmers Connie and John Doyle work alongside their neighbours, the Vanmechelens, who arrived in Ireland in the 1980s from the Drowned Land of Saeftinghe in Holland/Belgium leaving behind a farm which lay too close to the Doel nuclear power station. Archival media from Belgium and Holland is interwoven with present-day observational footage from West Cork, connecting disparate times and places, provoking reflection, and inspiring action for a more sustainable future.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2023-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hungry Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
