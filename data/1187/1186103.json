With the creation of this magical model universe, twin brothers Frederik and Gerrit Braun have fulfilled their childhood dream of building the largest model railroad in the world. Opened in 2001 in Hamburg's Speicherstadt warehouse district, the exhibition now stretches from the Elbphilharmonie concert hall to Antarctica and is one of the biggest crowd pullers in Europe, attracting more than 1.5 million visitors a year. This film now brings this fabulous dream world to the big screen for the first time with elaborate Cinemascope footage as a documentary
