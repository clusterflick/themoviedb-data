For centuries, the scriptures have shaped Western law, language, and culture; and the stories of the Bible are read and remembered around the world. But how much do we know about the story of its creation? Using expert interviews, stunning cinematography, and dramatic reenactments, Oracles of God The Story of the Old Testament follows the history and archaeology of the Old Testament, from Moses and the Torah through the Israelite kingdom, with special focus on the world's oldest copies of the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls. Filmed on location in Israel and narrated by actor Iain Glen, Oracles of God answers longstanding questions about when, where, and how the text of Old Testament was written, copied, and preserved over thousands of years.","popularity":0.4275,"poster_path":"/h7Qpsxwjwl0I89YgKwQp59HFKU9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Oracles of God the Story of the Old Testament","title":"Oracles of God the Story of the Old Testament","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iain Glen","original_name":"Iain Glen","popularity":1.9808,"profile_path":"/d9CKAAiV1HvSnzzmpDzD0mC0HlX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"651af58c223a8b00e1fabc1b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Danker","original_name":"Eli Danker","popularity":0.4885,"profile_path":"/eejtyn7Qn9Ex6MuJLDS9oOrF7DD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Essene Scribe","credit_id":"651af5d907216600acb530e0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4179696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Haloon","original_name":"Adam Haloon","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Muhammad 'The Wolf'","credit_id":"651af65f74507d00c5785306","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18327676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7Qpsxwjwl0I89YgKwQp59HFKU9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
