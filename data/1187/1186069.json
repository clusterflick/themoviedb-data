Films discussed: Dracula (Tod Browning, 1931), Germany Year Zero (Roberto Rossellini, 1948), The Birds (Alfred Hitchcock, 1963), Weekend (Jean-Luc Godard, 1967).  In the vaults of Concordia University's Visual Collections Repository department slept some 30 ½-inch black-and-white video open reels. They contained Jean-Luc Godard's 14 lessons, spread out from April 14, 1978 to October 21, 1978. The sessions consisted of long and brilliant series of digressions (often uninterrupted), initiated by questions from the audience or from Serge Losique. There are dazzling reflections on editing, economics, actors and actresses, war, political commitment, the media, and we witness the setting in motion of a unique thought.","popularity":0.1354,"poster_path":"/32L52oAH7oPeQvK2msURm0HZgtb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leçons de cinéma de Godard à Montréal, classe 11","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"651976359d592c0102c0119c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4300206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Losique","original_name":"Serge Losique","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6519763c74507d011c0d8547","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":895,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/32L52oAH7oPeQvK2msURm0HZgtb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":605}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
