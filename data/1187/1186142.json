They are gay, lesbian, trans, and they live together in Centre-Sud in the heart of Montreal, in a triplex that is falling apart. Between the parties that sometimes welcome more than two hundred people until the wee hours of the morning, the collective dinners, the great joys and the small despairs, this old flat has transformed the lives of its tenants. Twelve years later, the building is bought by a wealthy family who wants to live there, gentrification being the order of the day. This marks the end of a mythical space that has transformed Montreal's queer scene for a decade. The boxes are too small to contain all the stories that have taken place within these walls. EVICTION is the story of this turning page, as the distraught residents search for a new place to call home in the midst of a housing crisis and land speculation.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/dR5qpThY3ogVlwbqMqt1szT76JZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Éviction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathilde Capone","original_name":"Mathilde Capone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519a7fa93bd69011b8e4eda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathilde Capone","original_name":"Mathilde Capone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65360b2dc8a5ac00fffaaf28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathilde Capone","original_name":"Mathilde Capone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65360b3302842000c59c3379","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29519379","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tSphS7Tm7KaxqOTtWwFKHrdwA1N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dR5qpThY3ogVlwbqMqt1szT76JZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/efBVDjw29Smfm9NvQ6msBnAmsmE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RIDM","release_date":"2023-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
