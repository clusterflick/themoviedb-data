There is stuff everywhere, and a mountain of pills in blister packs lie haphazardly on top of a glass case. The loft turns out to be a clinic and the couple are qualified doctors. They are also artistic: she paints and draws, he is making a feature film, and their patients receive creative therapy in addition to regular treatment. This might not be a sterile, efficient hospital full of white coats, and the treatment rooms might look shabby, but there is real time and attention for people here.","popularity":0.4158,"poster_path":"/zAkLKbgktVoZI59PSdAPkatQVqa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seashore Image Production","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2023-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Clinic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"診所","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802591,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aung Min","original_name":"Aung Min","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67fbe96bc1e0a708cbace62a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Z","original_name":"Midi Z","popularity":0.2562,"profile_path":"/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg","credit_id":"651c118b223a8b00ab3d4a37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Z","original_name":"Midi Z","popularity":0.2562,"profile_path":"/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg","credit_id":"6530130f945d3600ca26f6b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1294367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wu Ke-Xi","original_name":"吳可熙","popularity":0.2428,"profile_path":"/w401WjwYr5m293vuigRv3eOqmjh.jpg","credit_id":"65301315edeb430138a3aa39","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511796,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Pan","original_name":"Peter Pan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65301300edeb4300fe7c327c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29548659","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1822,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zAkLKbgktVoZI59PSdAPkatQVqa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7FCcdpzBF3MPD3uwNUGvZWKTXjq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1350}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":337277,"name":"health-medical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2023-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
