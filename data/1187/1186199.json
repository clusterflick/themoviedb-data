Addressing recent revelations by DOD whistleblowers, the documentary highlights interviews with UFO abductee Tony Topping, who claims a variety of alien types exist and Avi Loeb claiming that extraterrestrials may send AI drones rather than 'manned' vehicles, to make 'first contact' with AI systems on Earth.","popularity":0.4853,"poster_path":"/eb5sDm6zXrVyk5N9sx79wh2uVW1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God Versus Aliens","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481708,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Howland","original_name":"John Howland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6630e9575545ca012443b6d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4678937,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Christopher Lee","original_name":"Mark Christopher Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6630e92090dde0012c2a41c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4678937,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Christopher Lee","original_name":"Mark Christopher Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6630e92a524978012aea9003","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684621,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kathleen Lee \t Matt Smith","original_name":"Kathleen Lee \t Matt Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6630e9676aa8e001291da90b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28247154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kqwzB7aK9MHV3PXwn0m6WFWjMTn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wWRkn6pmQu1pj6TFQZY8Bw2MNpA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eb5sDm6zXrVyk5N9sx79wh2uVW1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGBXpSPka62ihnZdbJ9TZmK2nhf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1575},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mT3qnAHZjfz7ojz2cfJbxDQiAyz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
