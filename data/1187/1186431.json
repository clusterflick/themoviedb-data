Enter \"Robotron\" - a name that seamlessly blended \"robot\" and \"electronics.\" This wasn't just a brand; it was an ambitious answer to the West's technological advancements, a testament to the GDR’s drive to match, if not surpass, Western innovation. Drawing inspiration from the corporate giants of the West, the GDR‘s government merged various businesses to form this tech behemoth. With 16 major hubs in Central Germany alone, it was clear: \"Robotron\" was to be the DDR's technological crown jewel. But what was the Socialist Unity Party (SED), the GDR's ruling party, envisioning with this grand venture? How did \"Robotron\" navigate the challenges of operating within a socialist planned economy, while striving for global excellence? And as it grew to dominate East Germany's tech landscape, why did it always seem to be one step behind the leading global tech powers?","popularity":0.6429,"poster_path":"/xK9SxAlFbXHlKMZdpN0IgOKq5SI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78931,"logo_path":null,"name":"UAP Video GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":823,"logo_path":"/275O5OoKjulWtY1uRHRXaYsrt9I.png","name":"Telepool","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robotron - High Tech made in GDR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Robotron: High Tech made in GDR","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Robotron - Computer made in GDR","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Robotron: Computer made in GDR","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1047,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3jHTM6sDqgZhjXgBk3ZAui0BfD1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1862},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ja3WC2DPhZnqLT13cGtRRniH8y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1912}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/xK9SxAlFbXHlKMZdpN0IgOKq5SI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6104,"name":"computer"},{"id":6566,"name":"computer chip"},{"id":156026,"name":"east germany"},{"id":237481,"name":"computer technology"},{"id":300148,"name":"gdr"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
