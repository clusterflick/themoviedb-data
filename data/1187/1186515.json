Then becomes an obsession? Well, like the Addams Family – voila! The house is a museum!  The Matchbox Man, director Gorman Bechard visits Charlie Mack, who began buying Matchbox cars in 1963, when he was 7; from his initial 20 to 30, his collection exploded to more than 42,000 – one of the world’s largest – prompting him to turn much of his Connecticut home into a showcase of nearly every model and variation ever made. And while he gives a look at his blistering array of colors and styles, he presents a history of a humble toy car that became an international phenomenon.","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":"/s3tBvaHYqxg2btY0P7mWbakoAT7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of one man’s obsession with cars…really really small cars…","title":"The Matchbox Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4302214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Mack","original_name":"Charlie Mack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"651ad9ee223a8b010329d2b8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"651ada19c50ad2012c19f724","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"651ada28ea84c700ca089557","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1108927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dean Falcone","original_name":"Dean Falcone","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651ada3d74507d00ac45d67b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14409438","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1987,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s3tBvaHYqxg2btY0P7mWbakoAT7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1325}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
