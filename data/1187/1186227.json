By no accident, the themes targeted are the usual scapegoats of the American Right—LGBTQ+ issues, Black History, and women’s empowerment—impeding the power of future generations to develop their own thoughts and opinions on critical social issues. By weaving together a lyrical montage of young readers and authors, THE ABCs OF BOOK BANNING reveals the voices of the impacted parties, and inspires hope for the future through the profound insights of inquisitive youthful minds.","popularity":1.3201,"poster_path":"/wcgYS6gv9dA0jBaQQft2eLjPAh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147938,"logo_path":"/5USotp1QuLWIHaJM4p6ODbuTB40.png","name":"MTV
