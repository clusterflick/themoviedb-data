She was just a child when this happened, and memories fade with the passage of time. Thus, the home videos that the most important woman in her life extensively shot begin to enter the picture. The documentary, with the poetic diction of the author's haunting voice, chronicles her journey from the sands of Arabia to the icy Antarctic, where she participated in a popular-science expedition. It is the contrast of two worlds, two completely different places, that brings her to question the titular places of the soul. Where do our memories remain? Where do we really belong at home? And where do we keep those who have already left us?","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/9xW51kYUOEdzrPcGpY282JyfrV2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feryal Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2023-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Places of the Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4308808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamida Issa","original_name":"Hamida Issa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652076f474507d00c57b2f58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360464,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justin Kramer","original_name":"Justin Kramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548e36f2866fa00ab121bdc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519839,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christopher Moon","original_name":"Christopher Moon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548e3a6fd4f8000c7fd4c63","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1756382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rana Eid","original_name":"Rana Eid","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548e3b741a56133693b748a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4308808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamida Issa","original_name":"Hamida Issa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548e33fd55c3d00abff2637","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4308808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamida Issa","original_name":"Hamida Issa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548e345fd4f80013ce9ed34","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4308808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamida Issa","original_name":"Hamida Issa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548e34c43494f0101c911d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29580334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2827,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9xW51kYUOEdzrPcGpY282JyfrV2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
