In this witty and delightfully unpredictable documentary, Rossellini invites viewers to join her on a day out in New York City, where animals—from the microscopic mites that live on her eyelashes to the rats that populate the subways—are never far from her endlessly curious mind.","popularity":0.1279,"poster_path":"/xPACQAY7F3jrvdIXHZfFyTFYyzU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animals Distract Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Rossellini","original_name":"Isabella Rossellini","popularity":2.4103,"profile_path":"/z0zojT6nwDxi35HMcXlVpBfuBAU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65197fc0c50ad200eabe8b57","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Rossellini","original_name":"Isabella Rossellini","popularity":2.4103,"profile_path":"/z0zojT6nwDxi35HMcXlVpBfuBAU.jpg","credit_id":"6519800c74507d00e20e601a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Rossellini","original_name":"Isabella Rossellini","popularity":2.4103,"profile_path":"/z0zojT6nwDxi35HMcXlVpBfuBAU.jpg","credit_id":"65197fd89d592c00b0c8f270","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bohannon","original_name":"John Bohannon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xES4sGHmva0QbtAhXitCTfbm9JJ.jpg","credit_id":"65197fff93bd6900e12e4942","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1839406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPACQAY7F3jrvdIXHZfFyTFYyzU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
