Working as a social worker at the Mission to Seafarers, she discovers a stowaway drifting aimlessly in the harbour, and decides to give the young man shelter in a decommissioned, cold war era nuclear fallout bunker that is being redesigned by her partner Antonia to serve as an archive dedicated to hagiographic graphology (the study of the saints through their handwriting). Hannah then retreats to a secluded cottage deep in the woods to confront pain and illumination alone.","popularity":0.089,"poster_path":"/mnEp2nQf5hGJlHNP1GCpwa8CkGd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravity and Grace","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2553970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Becca Babcock","original_name":"Becca Babcock","popularity":0.1133,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f38581f8813e400375461a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Andreino","original_name":"Aaron Andreino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f385825519bbb00316fe0f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":586529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Dunn","original_name":"Timothy Dunn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f38582a111da1003671e327","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes M.
