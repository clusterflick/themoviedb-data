When he is killed, she opens the envelope, finding half of a mysterious map and a piece of paper with instructions. Following these, Laura travels to Guayaquil, where she comes into contact with an Argentine geologist (Ricardo Bauleo), who owns the other half of the map. It turns out to be the map of a large treasure buried in the heart of the Ecuadorian jungle, in the territory of the fearsome Auca Indians, head reducers. Both are on the road, ready to face all the dangers that may be necessary, in order to get so valuable loot. But Laura's beauty and sensuality will awaken desire in all men throughout the dangerous expedition.","popularity":0.1864,"poster_path":"/pQ3JJ2RBdop9So3llaEz2iaerY0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1969-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cautiva en la selva","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Sensual Jungle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Bauleo","original_name":"Ricardo Bauleo","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/pyolo1BzzQ3QTgiVOkcPbqYJNqc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f36f2b26bdec30033c95883","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Casado","original_name":"Mario Casado","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f36f2c36bdec30032c7efbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Di Palma","original_name":"Julio Di Palma","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f36f2d88f26bc0035bc677d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Libertad Leblanc","original_name":"Libertad Leblanc","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/rdA4KlCm8EHJZT3pqSs4Ffnfqg9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"5f36f2edc4f55200340cc716","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1916385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilberto Peyret","original_name":"Gilberto Peyret","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ivan","credit_id":"5f36f3028813e40035538990","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1009566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Salcedo","original_name":"Jorge Salcedo","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/s5UFPBasC09uR9BvhE0XFDiHdIv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f36f31bc4f55200320ef952","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356708,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ricardo Younis","original_name":"Ricardo Younis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6195e19129733800290b0bd4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315234,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rosalino Caterbetti","original_name":"Rosalino Caterbetti","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f36f37a111da100366d9240","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":999428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Fleider","original_name":"Leo Fleider","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/dL8Wjp2caJjmiPp1eWQeaBoENrf.jpg","credit_id":"5f36f27b111da100366d8f21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016333,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jorge Falcón","original_name":"Jorge Falcón","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f36f29bc4f55200340cc6de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813692,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emilio Spitz","original_name":"Emilio Spitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f36f33611c0660037366200","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813702,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alejandro Saracino","original_name":"Alejandro Saracino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f36f392394a8700328a00cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tito Ribero","original_name":"Tito Ribero","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/dDkswh1VZNUlJAc2lK8QqSVR4sR.jpg","credit_id":"5f36f348c4f55200320ef97c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0188491","wikidata_id":"Q17993630","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yKYbjHK13lJglbF6YbLPEsQLG9l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pQ3JJ2RBdop9So3llaEz2iaerY0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"19691030 - Cautiva En La Selva (Película Completa HD720p)","key":"LP2rbaAMz4k","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-11T19:27:32.000Z","id":"61db2b96924ce5001cba50bc"}]}}}
