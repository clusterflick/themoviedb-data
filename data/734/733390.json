Narrated by landscape architect Gena Wirth, the film analyzes processes of dredging and sand filling as a key infrastructural process in the production of urban space. The film combines observational footage of New York’s massive harbor deepening project with a series of self-reflexive research spirals that take place within the director's imagined computer desktop. As a result, the project not only explores the making of urban coastal landscapes, but also how these sedimentary landscapes are entangled with digitally mediated spaces of discourse and image.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/qhYIFQxfHLKbgc7ZCDbg98QlImE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As If Sand Were Stone...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Mendelsohn","original_name":"Ben Mendelsohn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f38230215a4a10032fb6d11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1208,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhYIFQxfHLKbgc7ZCDbg98QlImE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":804}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
