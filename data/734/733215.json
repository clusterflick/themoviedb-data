Club Arak played Arabic music and queers could dance to the songs they only ever heard at family parties and weddings - where it is not safe to be gay. This documentary tells the story of how Club Arak empowered and encouraged Arabs to gather and celebrate their sexual and Arab identity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/50DgcbcvqY9NX75qDZ5vljH6qWf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Club Arak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1627193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fadia Abboud","original_name":"Fadia Abboud","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f376b2eefcea90037958f0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8106642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/50DgcbcvqY9NX75qDZ5vljH6qWf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
