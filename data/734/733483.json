Elecciones 2004 en Uruguay","overview":"In 2004, after 174 years in which political power was always held by one or other of the parties on the right, a historic change at last became possible in Uruguay. This documentary was filmed in the days coming up to the election, and it shows how the common people saw their country. The main protagonist is the man in the street. With humour, with intense emotions, with a lot of dignity and a passion for politics, these Uruguayans show how proud they are to be playing a role in their country's history.","popularity":0.464,"poster_path":"/lJuoT77qpCGvtVs2H4j6RqhU7CZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones de Hachaytiza","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2005-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way the Wind Blows in October.
