Ian Bostridge heads a starry cast alongside Britten Sinfonia Voices and musicians.  Benjamin Britten and William Plomer’s synthesis of a Noh play and Christian parable set in medieval East Anglia is a unique and extraordinary work – a piece shot through with the strange, exotic sounds of bells, un-tuned drums, organ and chamber ensemble. Curlew River sweeps audiences into a fascinating, unknown world portraying both Buddhist world views and Christian redemption beliefs.  Celebrated tenor Ian Bostridge heads a starry cast to reprise his acclaimed interpretation of the Madwoman. The cast also includes bass-baritone Ashley Riches as the Ferryman, alongside Britten Sinfonia and the orchestra’s own professional choir, Britten Sinfonia Voices, directed by Eamonn Dougan.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tyspOVjoz3LOaHg1Nr0rPEFBdvv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britten: Curlew River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tyspOVjoz3LOaHg1Nr0rPEFBdvv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
