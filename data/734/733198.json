Told almost entirely sans dialogue, LULA DEL RAY is the story of a lonely adolescent girl who lives with her mother on the outskirts of a vast satellite array in the middle of the desert. After a chance encounter over the radio, Lula becomes obsessed with a soulful country music duo, the Baden Brothers. Inspired by their music, she runs away from home and into a world of danger, deception, and disappointment.  Set in the mid-century American Southwest and inspired by the music of Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, and Patsy Cline, LULA DEL RAY is a mythic reinvention of the classic coming-of-age story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bklz3XddHQ9XghOZKU2YdVKENOZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manual Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lula Del Ray by Manual Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bklz3XddHQ9XghOZKU2YdVKENOZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
