In a taunt, tense 90 minutes, three people - a black man, a white man, and a white woman - clash over their contradictory senses of marginalization and betrayal and their contrasting perceptions of illusion and reality.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/luSgVtL0NaPZxi3OAAl5hmKVOby.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kernel of Sanity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregg Daniel","original_name":"Gregg Daniel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3756f211c0660035384cd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742594,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kermit Frazier","original_name":"Kermit Frazier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f37570dc4f5520032104c09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/luSgVtL0NaPZxi3OAAl5hmKVOby.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
