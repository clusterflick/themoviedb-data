People are dying of a mysterious illness, the source of which lies hidden in the water. The survivors hide in their apartments, but the contaminated water flows through their homes. Self-defence groups and despondent loners hunting their own kind roam through the empty streets. In an attempt to save her mother’s life, the heroine ventures out into the unknown, so that she can overcome her fear and attempt to rekindle her relationship with the outside world, which is now humanity’s mortal enemy.","popularity":0.1118,"poster_path":"/5nbW14YA887PYDr0XJRRaw8SoD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102895,"logo_path":"/l7vxt0fHlxH0mgPScm1a2Sv4ZZS.png","name":"Stereotactic","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mom, I Befriended Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2745238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alla Mitrofanova","original_name":"Alla Mitrofanova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3a663e7390c00039648e34","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1992116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Nikiforova","original_name":"Александра Никифорова","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":"/A0yB3C6iVyY0Zp4usTl5vm4zcGy.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"658fe0f74f9a9974be76fab3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2745240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Semenov","original_name":"Sergey Semenov","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3a66977390c00039649051","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2355038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sasha Voronov","original_name":"Sasha Voronov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a66c346aed400346546bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2355038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sasha Voronov","original_name":"Sasha Voronov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a66c7a3b5e60036ee0460","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Sorokin","original_name":"Vladimir Sorokin","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/giSBN0lFfpuRODJa8QKxr0aq3UV.jpg","credit_id":"5f3a66cfbe4b360033b097c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1987280,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pavel Karykhalin","original_name":"Pavel Karykhalin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/hWK3zVtDUENsqo6szZUoF0G7UK6.jpg","credit_id":"5f3a66d77390c0003a61480b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044360,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Evgeny Rodin","original_name":"Evgeny Rodin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a66dd22df2e00365e68b7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2745241,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniil Avramenko","original_name":"Daniil Avramenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a66eb2d1e4000359a8b1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13550038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5nbW14YA887PYDr0XJRRaw8SoD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Holland Island International Debut Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
