Sophocles’ ancient play, written and performed in 429 BC during the time of a plague that killed one-third of the Athenian population, is a timeless story of arrogant leadership, ignored prophecy, and a pestilence that ravages the city of Thebes. At the time the play was first performed, the audience would have been reeling in the wake of a pestilence and its economic, political, and social aftermath. Seen through this lens Oedipus the King appears to have been a powerful public health tool for helping Athenians communalize the trauma of the plague, through a story that is as relevant now as it was in its own time.","popularity":1.7653,"poster_path":"/xAvwzv2xkE2IKXrEOX3mmhSzoHo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theatre of War Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oedipus Project","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Isaac","original_name":"Oscar Isaac","popularity":7.3804,"profile_path":"/dW5U5yrIIPmMjRThR9KT2xH6nTz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Oedipus","credit_id":"5f375c61efcea900349a518f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances McDormand","original_name":"Frances McDormand","popularity":1.5666,"profile_path":"/r0A7hZsM1zuavTr0jN7bwmBcliR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jocosta","credit_id":"5f375c8511c0660035386d30","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Turturro","original_name":"John Turturro","popularity":1.6228,"profile_path":"/6O9W9cJW0kCqMzYeLupV9oH0ftn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Creon","credit_id":"5f375e9b8813e40038580a8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Wright","original_name":"Jeffrey Wright","popularity":1.6811,"profile_path":"/yGcuHGW4glqRpOPxgiCvjcren7F.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tiresias","credit_id":"5f375d548813e40037533377","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Faison","original_name":"Frankie Faison","popularity":0.8362,"profile_path":"/bNHMANGaSqcki768UVAdYiYdawZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Shepherd","credit_id":"5f375d316bdec30033cae54d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Strathairn","original_name":"David Strathairn","popularity":1.1335,"profile_path":"/fhkvTcrCDPTAclTnE7sqQS1NZKq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Messenger 1","credit_id":"5f375d2111c06600373765dc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2742614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Davis","original_name":"Glenn Davis","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/cHKQBPsqqV9UYwxkFZdzP1euk73.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Messenger 2","credit_id":"6439ece1e8d0b4049f9dda16","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130726,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophocles","original_name":"Sophocles","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":"/tdlnIVqgfXh7gpoCekAiuGTDWV9.jpg","credit_id":"6548e2edd55c3d00e21314c7","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Doerries","original_name":"Bryan Doerries","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f375ca8efcea900349a51fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eXdq7VREMbPDSepqtcsyeQgzLJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":861,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xAvwzv2xkE2IKXrEOX3mmhSzoHo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Summer Nostos Festival","release_date":"2020-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Oedipus Project Trailer","key":"_Poph2fvdQc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-09T18:14:55.000Z","id":"6179a213229ae200900a7209"}]}}}
