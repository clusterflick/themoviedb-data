Draeger's was their last show ever in their Chelsea space. At his advice, the dealer rented a storage unit at Storage Mart to store the unsold stock. Draeger asked if he could store a few items with the dealer: a huge tripod, a few Sotheby frames and a recent sculpture that he had hammered from a NYC parking sign. Four years later, Draeger received a call from the producers of Storage Wars, asking permission to feature his work in the show. Storage Mart auctions off any possessions from a unit that remains unpaid for three months. All Draeger's objects and many of his friends' artworks changed owner. The sculpture, which the new owner Joe P. calls a \"crazy installation\", has never been seen again.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/A4eTLw4t2Lht4Qjgyp6WvzekQRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storage War Loot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Pauletich","original_name":"Joe Pauletich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f36ad2fc4f552003308e441","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1908518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Draeger","original_name":"Christoph Draeger","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/AtItlJhKmsAwBCh7gqTPKaHMflj.jpg","credit_id":"5f36acf86bdec30032c74143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A4eTLw4t2Lht4Qjgyp6WvzekQRy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
