The film uses poetry-like film semantics to travel a sociopolitical path between gun violence, leader figures, war images and subsequent refugees. It is composed of physically manipulated 24 frames per second, using bleach etching, watercolors, oil pastels, markers and cuts using sharp objects. At times, the film which is fed through a projector is manually slowed down until it burns. The suggested impact of the leader figure initiates a physical cataclysm to the body of the film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nMOwtRAB8F6xPUSQLlL7kPQ5WXr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Universal Leader","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orit Ben-Shitrit","original_name":"Orit Ben-Shitrit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3864bb519bbb003170036a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1188,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nMOwtRAB8F6xPUSQLlL7kPQ5WXr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":792}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Crossroads 2020","release_date":"2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
