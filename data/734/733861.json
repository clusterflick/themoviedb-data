Concentrating on the expression of bodies in movement, the piece frames cultural manifestations historically linked to anti-colonial resistance alongside contemporary trends aligned with a consumer-based industry embraced by emerging economies today. The registered dance sessions involve individuals and groups that perform in a staged event at \"Le Casino\", a cinema and theatre hall built in the 30's that also served for meetings of the worker's union of the city's port.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/33b62TH0iC4wDJalRoPb3gVjIhq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinéma Casino","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1760807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bárbara Wagner","original_name":"Bárbara Wagner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uddU5jo38aX004PJ6MUtWgseDb8.jpg","credit_id":"5f39b79c7390c00037604cb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin de Burca","original_name":"Benjamin de Burca","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tDTltE25fdexpKZsXdgMxey1MJV.jpg","credit_id":"5f39b7a8519bbb003473f5aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin de Burca","original_name":"Benjamin de Burca","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tDTltE25fdexpKZsXdgMxey1MJV.jpg","credit_id":"5fecd7f431644b003f099488","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2917100,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jerome Chereau","original_name":"Jerome Chereau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fecd804e004a600422895bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1760807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bárbara Wagner","original_name":"Bárbara Wagner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uddU5jo38aX004PJ6MUtWgseDb8.jpg","credit_id":"5fecd7e731644b003f099476","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2917102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samuel Narsou","original_name":"Samuel Narsou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fecd823c4ad590041e862b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2917101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnaud Minatchy","original_name":"Arnaud Minatchy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fecd8124ccc50003f7f52c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12797266","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/33b62TH0iC4wDJalRoPb3gVjIhq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1001}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
