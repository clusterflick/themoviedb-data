Israel interrupts the broadcast of \"Sawt Al-Sha'eb,\" as Fairuz finishes performing Talal Haidar's poem \"Wahdun\" (They Alone) and starts singing another verse in which she declares her eternal love for Lebanon. Meanwhile, ships are evacuating those fleeing the flames of war—three enormous contradictions. Coincidence can carry so much meaning.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9EK6gvdesWz8MWosgnk8JAYytOJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2006-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled (To the Lebanese Citizens)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Cherri","original_name":"Ali Cherri","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6757f920abc1edadc0c53ed1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1161,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9EK6gvdesWz8MWosgnk8JAYytOJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":776}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
