After his attempt to meet with her fails due to an angry superintendent in her apartment building, he receives some help from the genie of the spittoon who provides an effective way to get to her balcony. Once they depart the angry man gives chase, aided by two mice and a bathtub, attacking with a water jet and a cannon and no concern for the girl's safety. From 1926, this is one of Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman's earliest works.","popularity":0.0761,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harman-Ising Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aladdin's Vamp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Aladdin's Battle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugh Harman","original_name":"Hugh Harman","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/6aVWLy6yqpN8OdrkLzH3LeUcO2N.jpg","credit_id":"6759cf99e2eda6864b40c05b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Ising","original_name":"Rudolf Ising","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/mPcWz8CHJTftnY4QRmpJRmw07Bm.jpg","credit_id":"6759cfa3e2eda6864b40c05f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10695378","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
