Featuring Ana Farache, the film was meant as a tribute to classic cinema actresses who inspired him in his youth. Unfortunately, it was left unfinished. Nearly 40 years later, after Amin appeared in a dream detailing the film, his friends Paulo Cunha and Ivan Cordeiro revisited the original footage Ivan had shot and decided to “complete” the project, calling it a “transcreation.” This work embodies the spirit of affective and anarchic super-8 filmmaking from Brazil’s Northeast during the military dictatorship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A CHEGADA DO TREM FANTASMA À ESTAÇÃO DA SERRA DA BORBOREMA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
