Shot over one day in London, the film captures a visit that Osaro made to her immediate family, who emigrated from Ireland; her parents had initially moved to Ireland from Nigeria.  Although Osaro's family is a short distance away geographically, the film carries a sense of reconnection with the present while referencing the past. Scenes shift from Osaro’s parents and siblings filmed in real time to close-ups of old photos of extended family members, held in the frame until they blur out. Osaro’s unfamiliarity with the Super 8 medium gives her freedom to use the camera in a way that's unbound to tradition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2024-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things Are Tough - Things Are Glorious","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5112907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Osaro Azams","original_name":"Osaro Azams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759aa6fda3bd39b878612d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
