But it is not the military actions that are at the center of what is happening, but the fate of people, their sorrows and hopes. A young first-year Dandelion, drafted in the last days of the war, suffers completely childishly from the fact that he will not get military glory. His older friend, Dervoed, in front of whom his wife and son died, is suffering unable to cope with the mental pain. In contrast, the Rebel, who was taken to the military enlistment office right from his own wedding, is nervous and fierce. A real \"war dog\", he only knows how to kill. What to do when the war is over, where to put yourself?","popularity":0.2276,"poster_path":"/rVUzS8Jqp8DnG7mVJubDAOqooaK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14620,"logo_path":"/zbQk1aw57z6LUOSQzb0MoZDLiUz.png","name":"Gosteleradio USSR","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1985-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Privates","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Ryadovye","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirill Lavrov","original_name":"Кирил Лавров","popularity":0.4554,"profile_path":"/9ZPBmI1vsbGW5A3hRm9ZDMFKz8w.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"675862e6637463229eafd481","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Nevedomsky","original_name":"Леонид Неведомский","popularity":0.2797,"profile_path":"/fzbDglyVpxRKsj1z4tbJoxKxVs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"675862fa460447b09de41652","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Tolubeyev","original_name":"Андрей Толубеев","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/tWrvQCjZQuT5aSy21h6meKpdK7K.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67586303637463229eafd48a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4960103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksei Falileev","original_name":"Алексей Фалилеев","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6758630ef81bcdb9cb63356d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larisa Malevannaya","original_name":"Лариса Малеванная","popularity":0.2011,"profile_path":"/8Wa255OWC74jG7G2Q2tKkA2yPAY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6758642feedec22d8aec0db3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3148750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyudmila Sapozhnikova","original_name":"Людмила Сапожникова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67586440eedec22d8aec0dc7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":556851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Bedova","original_name":"Татьяна Бедова","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/2jai945vddbX9qUhOXjn9kQXQkx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"675864931287d9b46ba19bff","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2106153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Tarasova","original_name":"Tatyana Tarasova","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/40XHiXzehmiW88PFrmOlW9d35fP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6758649e31f9d1c8f23729d2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1773970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Palmov","original_name":"Олег Пальмов","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":"/rPrF7ZTPtmzWB61zkC9v8PjJpPf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"675864a91287d9b46ba19c09","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriy Stoyanov","original_name":"Юрий Стоянов","popularity":0.2582,"profile_path":"/608WncKqcLdTMo6jucbpsyqNT5q.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"675864b38842b711121ada56","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2039486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgi Tovstonogov","original_name":"Георгий Товстоногов","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/cCIOLfLInpi4hD1BwcjAulSFsza.jpg","credit_id":"675864f6f81bcdb9cb6336d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118746,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aleksei Dudaryov","original_name":"Алексей Дударёв","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/7sGzI6NxWeAxkJRKX3pJczh2wkP.jpg","credit_id":"67586510f81bcdb9cb6336e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uuUY8hIajsgN1kvSzt7iL56CaJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rVUzS8Jqp8DnG7mVJubDAOqooaK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
