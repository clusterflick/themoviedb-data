Close-up shots of a woman smoking, a television screen and other scenes are accompanied by an intimate voice over: \"Maybe the moment of the split will reproduce itself endlessly. Maybe the moment of the split never existed. Maybe the moment of the split will dissolve into light.\" Heidi Tikka questions the Freudian notion of the split subject by replacing it with her vision of an endlessly layered, multiple and rhythmic process. On the Threshold of Liberty is greatly philosophical but also explicitly sensual, operating on the affective, rather than cognitive level.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xWWD0UjIOSiusCnta3YlKJtoR7u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Threshold of Liberty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heidi Tikka","original_name":"Heidi Tikka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759e59f2b451a26baf6ca82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xWWD0UjIOSiusCnta3YlKJtoR7u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
