However, her impetuous and rage-prone temperament causes her problems, triggering public episodes of wrath that draw criticism and a court order forcing her to participate in a five-week group therapy program.  She arrives at Sacred Circle, a retreat in the midst of nature in Umbria. Initially, Lola feels completely out of place and attempts to sabotage the experience; however, just as she begins to find serenity, a call from her manager prompts her to return to the stage. After an intimate night with Ravi, the retreat leader, Lola returns to Naples. Despite her renewed success, she decides to give up her race for fame to seek a deeper existential balance.","popularity":0.1381,"poster_path":"/kOhaM8IrLqNl3lnMll1YfPHnFn0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246912,"logo_path":null,"name":"P1
