Narrated by three of its members—Eulalia Carrizosa, Patricia Restrepo, and Clara Riascos—through semi-structured interviews that intersect the personal, professional and political, this short film also reuses Cine Mujer’s archive. Its purpose is, one the one hand, to contribute to restoring its legacy and, on the other hand, to reframe and resignify its images within women’s ongoing battle for equality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film By Cine Mujer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Restrepo","original_name":"Patricia Restrepo","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"675a0e6e9fe2066e69ea867d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eulalia Carrizosa","original_name":"Eulalia Carrizosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"675a0e8a30336932a5638a61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Clara Riascos","original_name":"Clara Riascos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"675a0e959a20f2fb98949bac","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Cervera","original_name":"Lorena Cervera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675a0d8affbc0fcc3d44c5f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Cervera","original_name":"Lorena Cervera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675a0df58733a1c110d0853b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113616,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sonia Kerfa","original_name":"Sonia Kerfa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675a0e139fe2066e69ea8667","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
