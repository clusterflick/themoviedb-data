He creates flamboyant and fantastical costumes that challenge our perception of gender - showcased in different landscapes from the Turner Contemporary in Margate to woods in Kent. In this film, Robert explores his identity as an artist, a trans woman and a son. Mum Georgie has always empowered him to be true to himself, so when sheâ€™s given a terminal diagnosis, Robert turns to his art as a coping mechanism.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert and Georgie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1774422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clare Richards","original_name":"Clare Richards","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/lwqwJGLsdcsYjyKyC0p1vgeb9sE.jpg","credit_id":"675988d1359dc5fc883f1b80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
