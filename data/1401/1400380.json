This is a story of fraternal bonds, of community, belief, and of the transformative powers of performance. Fiction and reality become one: the farmer becomes a general, the young man becomes a brave prince, the metal worker becomes a hero. Bardi is a choral film, sung by different men and boys. It is an ode to a different kind of community, a closed world of transmission and belief, where the forging of the self is played out in a theater of horses and of men.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kairoi Films","origin_country":"MA"},{"id":8469,"logo_path":"/gSSXLuayChi5h9KEuzfwd2UjWjm.png","name":"Louverture Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":210690,"logo_path":"/v3g2Sjn0G0oOJVCgvaA37aQvoqW.png","name":"K Films","origin_country":"MA"},{"id":2622,"logo_path":"/2ZWtZLYbuQVPNvLJNv85uhEhZkO.png","name":"Ciné-Sud Promotion","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Bardi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1354676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tala Hadid","original_name":"Tala Hadid","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/baZTOJxIAFK65W5zl5Bz4BfG6t6.jpg","credit_id":"6758c47f0ab7e8077cfc1917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1354676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tala Hadid","original_name":"Tala Hadid","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/baZTOJxIAFK65W5zl5Bz4BfG6t6.jpg","credit_id":"6758c4967680b1177f3ac377","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Abdelmounim El Jarib","original_name":"Abdelmounim El Jarib","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6800fd624f59c24c0dad2d34","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11483190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gCKxqz9YJmefZ6Eg9WHIS7g3RBB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8HYhEBc0q91slE0ETqqWJpkhOeF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
