Black colour covers his consciousness and he loses touch with reality.

Not finding a way out of the city, the man freezes like a stone himself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/85DZn3c0fbCfQn3PibI7RmJAkzJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222425,"logo_path":"/hd5kbxSnZE95OICrmwEws5p3Lfq.png","name":"Vilniaus technologijų ir dizaino kolegija","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2025-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5111933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","original_name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758dc355c364c4a67ffc642","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5111933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","original_name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758dc405c364c4a67ffc648","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5111933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","original_name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758dc4d5c364c4a67ffc654","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5111933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","original_name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758dc5939b533d942485833","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laurynas Kamarauskas","original_name":"Laurynas Kamarauskas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758dc6326b9b8adaffee4d5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laurynas Kamarauskas","original_name":"Laurynas Kamarauskas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758dc692d200c84f1910e6a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5111933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","original_name":"Rebeka Salomėja Kavaliauskaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758dc7639b533d94248583f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34968383","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/85DZn3c0fbCfQn3PibI7RmJAkzJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vilnius Short Film Festival","release_date":"2025-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
