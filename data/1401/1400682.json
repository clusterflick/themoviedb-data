From his unique upbringing as a Southern Jewish Cajun to navigating life in New York City, Matthew shares side-splitting anecdotes about cultural quirks, family dynamics, and the absurdities of modern relationships.  With mathematical precision and laser wit, he tackles everything from the nuances of anti-Semitism to the emasculation of dating a professional athlete. Whether dissecting the inefficiency of French phonetics, the upsides of maternal mental illness, or pharmaceutical origin stories, Broussard delivers a performance both intellectually engaging and snort-inducingly funny.","popularity":0.0519,"poster_path":"/pEuGWvVlB404ZVC0IK7g8cLx5mJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matthew Broussard: Hyperbolic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3082799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Broussard","original_name":"Matthew Broussard","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/AcubBpAfHiwGSrDm2UzJ8rxSqQv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6759b5700b15bdb9ec1f446a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3082799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Broussard","original_name":"Matthew Broussard","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/AcubBpAfHiwGSrDm2UzJ8rxSqQv.jpg","credit_id":"6759b562a174bb78f4a59a65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2735166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Katz","original_name":"Jason Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759bc04a174bb78f4a59b1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3684864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Webb","original_name":"James Webb","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759bc180b15bdb9ec1f44e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3082799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Broussard","original_name":"Matthew Broussard","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/AcubBpAfHiwGSrDm2UzJ8rxSqQv.jpg","credit_id":"6759bc2cf0f1ea799ba70f63","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113037,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Sogar","original_name":"Laura Sogar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759bc4ae2eda6864b40bd7b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2735166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Katz","original_name":"Jason Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759bc6a65ef4e91d7e8db37","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2735166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Katz","original_name":"Jason Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759bc837c3704a1a8ec93fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3684864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Webb","original_name":"James Webb","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759bcb3359dc5fc883f2339","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xDSCbGz7S1JMJ4w6PQWxTROSg4S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.499,"height":409,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8PzzXDz44kSEKZuLfCPhicsBbyJ.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":613}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pEuGWvVlB404ZVC0IK7g8cLx5mJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jtcTkw9Q7LesabmEYTIkICO5Ooq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
