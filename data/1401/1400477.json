The construction of the biographical narrative revisits key moments in Selma's career, such as when she traveled with theater companies, her first time as a drag queen, and her debut as a performance artist. Her personal life is also explored, from her childhood in the countryside of Rio Grande do Sul to her acceptance of her gender identity. Her current work adds a new challenge to the struggle of the LGBTQIA+ community in the capital of Santa Catarina: she holds a public office, never before held by a trans person. She has the decision-making power to advance the struggle of the LGBTQIA+ community in the capital of Santa Catarina.","popularity":0.2913,"poster_path":"/dJOVxGJ7c9kVCoRcSYfJccaPzLy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102561,"logo_path":null,"name":"An Independent Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2024-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Selma Light: Para os aplausos do público","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selma Light","original_name":"Selma Light","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"675901af7c3704a1a8ec7fc3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5112174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcos Albuquerque","original_name":"Marcos Albuquerque","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675902ab359dc5fc883f0f26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5112175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Oliari","original_name":"Mariana Oliari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675902c7359dc5fc883f0f3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":2148,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/prjUoAPFZBk7uG4gg4EdKfg0rYe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3815}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":2865,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/dJOVxGJ7c9kVCoRcSYfJccaPzLy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1931}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":239589,"name":"jornalism"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":343583,"name":"selma light"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"14","descriptors":["Sensitive Themes","Inappropriate Language"],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
