Using the slogan ‘think once, think twice, think bike’, the film features a graphic depiction of an accident to shock the audience.  A very similar tactic is still in use today in the recently launched ‘Think – take longer to look for bikes’ campaign which also shows a motorcyclist crashing into the side of a car.  A Department for Transport report from 2006 concluded that the most common cause of motorcycle crashes is a ‘right of way’ violation…the majority of these incidents occur at T-junctions and it is usually the motorist – rather than the biker – who is at fault.’  ‘In around 65% of these ‘right of way’ incidents, a driver somehow fails to see a motorcyclist who should be in clear view.’","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Office of Information for Department of Transport","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Think Bike - Jimmy Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Think Bike - Jimmy Hill (1978)","key":"3rA0jdLUJn8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-06-28T18:58:10.000Z","id":"6758692c15442011ffe82862"}]}}}
