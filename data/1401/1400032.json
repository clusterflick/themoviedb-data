Although they are in different fields, their names differ by only one letter. Suzuki, who hates to lose, is irritated by being compared to the other dancer. One day, Sugiki suddenly invites Suzuki to \"aim to be champion together in 10 Dances.\" 10 Dances is a competitive dance where dancers who have mastered Latin and standard dance compete in 10 dances. Suzuki initially refuses Sugiki's proposal to teach each other and aim for the top because it seems too reckless. However, he is overwhelmed by Sugiki's provocative and competitive attitude and accepts in anger. The two are opposites in terms of personality and everything and they clash, but as they take lessons every day, they work hard together and gradually close the gap. Then, Suzuki gradually realizes that he is starting to be attracted to Sugiki.","popularity":0.4171,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205952,"logo_path":null,"name":"EPISCOPE","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":185004,"logo_path":"/tyHnxjQJLH6h4iDQKhN5iqebWmX.png","name":"Netflix","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"10Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"10 Dance","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"テンダンス","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryoma Takeuchi","original_name":"竹内涼真","popularity":0.5725,"profile_path":"/oT5B5nkQt1iwVtk8L86QeSuGTYq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shinya Suzuki","credit_id":"6757d50a31f9d1c8f237113b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keita Machida","original_name":"町田啓太","popularity":0.9125,"profile_path":"/fbc42SNQgPSbx3jtv2Z5Vsrt6MO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Shinya Sugiki","credit_id":"6757d5127680b1177f3aa4ee","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keishi Otomo","original_name":"大友啓史","popularity":0.2651,"profile_path":"/fHIRSwbRmRhEvfb9zaCLhj9WnE0.jpg","credit_id":"6757d45c3509719dd1476d0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keishi Otomo","original_name":"大友啓史","popularity":0.2651,"profile_path":"/fHIRSwbRmRhEvfb9zaCLhj9WnE0.jpg","credit_id":"6757d46a3509719dd1476d1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1057922,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomoko Yoshida","original_name":"吉田智子","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6757d4b48842b711121ac40b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5109963,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Satoh Inoue","original_name":"Satoh Inoue","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6757d4c131f9d1c8f2371110","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34762360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n5QG4O48JWPsP6x7i5YCGNH8kO6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":13141,"name":"based on manga"},{"id":289844,"name":"boys' love (bl)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
