Instead, he’s met by a robotic, automated voice calmly informing him: “...unfortunately, all our operators are busy right now...” Stuck, with no other means of communication, he has no choice but to wait. Surrounded by an endless expanse of sand and rocks, boredom quickly sets in, forcing him to find creative ways to pass the time. As the monotonous hold music plays on, isolation begins to wear him down, and he’s left desperately hoping for a response that can’t come soon enough.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":"/jvkuI4bBx9W3bfyyK37dwQFM4u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"After crash landing on a desolate planet, an astronaut is left stuck waiting for rescue with nothing to do.","title":"Singularity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3784196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Docking","original_name":"Hugo Docking","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6YW8Qpqab57k0gLf9lXY7kjRran.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Spaceman","credit_id":"6759fc20dd5a30c42daf1f82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilary Beaton","original_name":"Hilary Beaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Interactive Voice Response","credit_id":"6759fc60a04b3be5d9882726","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Flowers","original_name":"Joe Flowers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Call Operator","credit_id":"6759fc800d4f1dabc022b9b2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503087,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Pip Denning","original_name":"Pip Denning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fc975f4d3aa3c74cc17a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503084,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Erin Hilsdon","original_name":"Erin Hilsdon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fcea7ab27ae97e26c953","department":"Art","job":"Prop Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503089,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Conor Mullin","original_name":"Conor Mullin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fd059a20f2fb9894992f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503089,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Conor Mullin","original_name":"Conor Mullin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fd128733a1c110d08306","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503089,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Conor Mullin","original_name":"Conor Mullin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fd20dd5a30c42daf1f9e","department":"Art","job":"Prop Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503089,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Conor Mullin","original_name":"Conor Mullin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fd2f0720626735185b67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113517,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Leeming Froudakis","original_name":"Alexander Leeming Froudakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fd7f9fe2066e69ea8310","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113518,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"George Poole","original_name":"George Poole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fda730336932a5638769","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Flowers","original_name":"Joe Flowers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759fdb98733a1c110d0833d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jvkuI4bBx9W3bfyyK37dwQFM4u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Singularity Trailer","key":"833260460","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-05T10:39:10.000Z","id":"6759fdf19fe2066e69ea8323"}]}}}
