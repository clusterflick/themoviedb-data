Each of the five parts takes up and highlights one of the formal details of the initial image: my own silhouette during the prologue, the parallels of the shutters and windows, the immobility of the cars, the passing movement and the triangle of the pavement. Each part rhythmically reorganizes the initial image, the rhythms are inspired by the formal aspect of the detail.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rue X Décomposition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlo Werner","original_name":"Carlo Werner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67593d7aa174bb78f4a58cd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
