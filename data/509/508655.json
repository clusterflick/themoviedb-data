Nothing special, a common thing - that's exactly what taxi driver Vanya, who takes an order from Tina, thinks so. Together they have to spend the whole night, during which the driver learns that among Muscovites long ago vampires live on equal terms, who also, like everyone, want love. I want her and Tina, who, despite the eternal life and blood-sucking nature, has not lost the naivety inherent in girls looking for true love in nightclubs.","popularity":0.0797,"poster_path":"/SXnddJUOL501KEqdTZOYU0Ni9P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1038,"logo_path":"/o62j8ZNXmRTrq6ThviFWiL9zb8J.png","name":"Bazelevs
