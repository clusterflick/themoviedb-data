From the 1920s, vivacious Clara Bow and seductive siren Louise Brooks are most remembered, but none made the impact of Marlene Dietrich, an icon of mystery, or Greta Garbo, with her perfect features and gloomy introspection. From the power of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis to the seductiveness of Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner, Hollywood studios produced their own brand of beautiful, sassy and confident women. But it wasn't to last. The era drew to a close with the supreme fame of Elizabeth Taylor and the tragic death of Marilyn Monroe.","popularity":0.4977,"poster_path":"/8qRbebdpOEg0bhcsOq2YcfnPlK7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":17179,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Arena","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Screen Goddesses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth McGovern","original_name":"Elizabeth McGovern","popularity":1.6454,"profile_path":"/4R4NGwaGCTzAoMy0fWuVs3xm6dA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a99cacf92514127ea0112ad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David M.
