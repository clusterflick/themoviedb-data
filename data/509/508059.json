Two people on a stroll at the end of an night, at the end of the Berlin myth of Prenzlauer Berg: they are sexy, they are young, they are forlorn. It could be a wild summer. There will be two happy days in Berlin. The movie tells the tale of a place, the tale of a love, the tale of longing for a new beginning. More than an extraordinary independent movie, a universal big-city novel which could, without that affectionate local color, take place in every metropolis. Exodus or exitus: 'Tenerife EXIT' plays between and with them both.","popularity":0.1158,"poster_path":"/q5z9SdlwKRtXBXDkvqTk0lz9swd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teneriffa EXIT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Eckert","original_name":"Christian Eckert","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"5a95f0b2c3a36859f7000185","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Faßnacht","original_name":"Paul Faßnacht","popularity":0.217,"profile_path":"/g0UsdA2N2RX9nqB2rolpeO5ydqp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The German","credit_id":"5a95f0c09251417b150001a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1597476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietmar Obst","original_name":"Dietmar Obst","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pensioner","credit_id":"5a95f0cf0e0a2654470001f8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1671053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernd Heiber","original_name":"Bernd Heiber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a95f09f0e0a2654470001ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1965145","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q5z9SdlwKRtXBXDkvqTk0lz9swd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
