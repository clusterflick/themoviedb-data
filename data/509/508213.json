The idea of producing European films financed by American funds, in fact, originated in Italy with Paramount Pictures. Masterpieces such as Nights of Cabiria, Romeo and Juliet and The Conformist, to name just a few, were created precisely thanks to the work of these two men. The exclusive testimonies of Gioia Levi and Tony Luraschi, the children of the two executives, describe how their fathers were not only businessmen but how their lives were dedicated entirely to cinema.","popularity":0.2395,"poster_path":"/3GFCSfU2LKi9HbVTmXNObBACPfe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Italian Jobs - Paramount Pictures e l'Italia","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriano Giannini","original_name":"Adriano Giannini","popularity":0.7759,"profile_path":"/kJiwMKAFUgHreid1ES0xrG8r5H0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narratore","credit_id":"5ed0d98de4b57600202d6af8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felice Laudadio","original_name":"Felice Laudadio","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d99d5c071b001e2c569e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gioia Levi","original_name":"Gioia Levi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9a8528b2e001f65d35d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438865,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Enrico Lucherini","original_name":"Enrico Lucherini","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9b7e4b576001f2f2b3d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Luraschi","original_name":"David Luraschi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9c4e4b576001f2f2b52","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Luraschi","original_name":"Tony Luraschi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9d0e61e6d001cce3a34","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319525,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claudio Masenza","original_name":"Claudio Masenza","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9dae4b576001e2c7703","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Montanari","original_name":"Francesco Montanari","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/aMNmw6Du3rgTGbmXJS4P8W9vssc.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9e7e4b576001e2c770a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761814,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tonino Pinto","original_name":"Tonino Pinto","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9f2aaec7100206b67b0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Scarano","original_name":"Greta Scarano","popularity":0.296,"profile_path":"/sqx4AEA5Dn2J8Q2f8iyTtGA7mKt.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Se stesso","credit_id":"5ed0d9fd98f1f1001deca4d5","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Spagnoli","original_name":"Marco Spagnoli","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/9zMUNaCim06plJRLSC6YRk2UUmG.jpg","credit_id":"5a96c76bc3a3685a2400c8e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7313300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iBEGmTZ7rZ3MPtUInoF2AbNLpxe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1571,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3GFCSfU2LKi9HbVTmXNObBACPfe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
