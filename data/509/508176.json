Nothing stirs far and wide.  Suddenly, a figure comes out of the forest, running quickly to the farm.  There's a quick grab and the hunting rifle is hidden in the gutter.  There's a jump to the window sill:  Obermeier Martl creeps like a cat into his room.  No one's seen him.  At the same time, the doorbell rings at Doctor Rauch's place.  The hunter's mate Hias is standing outside.  \"Doctor, you have to bandage me:  I've been shot!\"  By whom, he doesn't know.","popularity":0.2017,"poster_path":"/9EpPTiM7v92PphgRaagCqrvvfyQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tonlicht-Film GmbH, Peter Ostermayr","origin_country":""},{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1936-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hunter of Fall","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Richter","original_name":"Paul Richter","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/8NxDkOULXevn2rgUysQQlB0VD90.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Friedl","credit_id":"5a96e41a0e0a26015c00044c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":591197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Holl","original_name":"Georgia Holl","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Burgl","credit_id":"5a96e42a0e0a260165000434","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Adalbert Schlettow","original_name":"Hans Adalbert Schlettow","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/vH9V40S4DsKceDEZiWgCZZabKky.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Blasi","credit_id":"5a96e44b92514128a40003ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1330936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thea Aichbichler","original_name":"Thea Aichbichler","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Buchnerin","credit_id":"5a96e45a0e0a260150000452","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustl Gstettenbaur","original_name":"Gustl Gstettenbaur","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/3AcR5jwBB0mBA8HZjPn0jVN11lM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Toni Donhart","credit_id":"5a96e46792514128ad00043c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Pinegger","original_name":"Rolf Pinegger","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lenz","credit_id":"5aca98ab9251414344003a55","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Rösner","original_name":"Willy Rösner","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/mbMfmlJjQBa70NySfDL4KBz8leu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Birkhofbauer","credit_id":"5aca98bbc3a3687e950039c0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Deppe","original_name":"Hans Deppe","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/4izzHQgMQFCfxmaf8QSOOsHvWB0.jpg","credit_id":"5a96a9c2c3a36859ff0086e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50890,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Dalman","original_name":"Joseph Dalman","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb18c8c3a368776c83a3b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50890,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Dalman","original_name":"Joseph Dalman","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb18d192514108d1fb1bd1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ludwig Ganghofer","original_name":"Ludwig Ganghofer","popularity":0.144,"profile_path":"/iqrnU67tZtooJHaVETbWhumDTiK.jpg","credit_id":"5cbb191dc3a36872c98532a8","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0027833","wikidata_id":"Q5261166","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9EpPTiM7v92PphgRaagCqrvvfyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":987}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
