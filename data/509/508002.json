For nearly a millennium, this vigorous and soulful music was part of the celebration of Jewish life in Eastern Europe. In the early decades of this century, the music took root in America. Klezmer musicians learned hundreds of tunes by ear and their ears were open to Gypsy, Ukrainian and Greek melodies of the old world, as well as to the new sounds of American jazz. Music born in Eastern Europe lived on in the imaginations of composers for New York's Yiddish theater, men whose tunes entered the mainstream through such unlikely adapters as the Andrew Sisters. Eventually Klezmer went underground as its audience assimilated into mainstream American culture.","popularity":0.2565,"poster_path":"/cRmbZ2WR8L5bL1FcmqdggQDxSH1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4095,"logo_path":"/zR0M1hMBNRKyYnRHMidK9WjUsUX.png","name":"First Run Features","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Jumpin' Night in the Garden of Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Schwartz","original_name":"Leon Schwartz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a95c1780e0a262f0400641e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hankus Netsky","original_name":"Hankus Netsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a95c1ea92514154f1005de0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":128886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Byron","original_name":"Don Byron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a95c1f6c3a36811a3005b91","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Alpert","original_name":"Michael Alpert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a95c202c3a368117d0057f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Sapoznik","original_name":"Henry Sapoznik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a95c463c3a3681170005ea5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Bressler","original_name":"Judy Bressler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a95c4700e0a262f0d0068d4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Tarras","original_name":"Dave Tarras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a95c47e0e0a262f0d0068e0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161764,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michal Goldman","original_name":"Michal Goldman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c1d151ac2920085552e12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161764,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michal Goldman","original_name":"Michal Goldman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a95c1a192514154ed005b39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colin Macnab","original_name":"Colin Macnab","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a95c42392514154eb005fe0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161764,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michal Goldman","original_name":"Michal Goldman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a95c19592514154ed005b2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986781,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boyd Estus","original_name":"Boyd Estus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a95c1c392514154fa005ea1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0349667","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cRmbZ2WR8L5bL1FcmqdggQDxSH1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2315,"name":"jewish life"},{"id":242485,"name":"klezmer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jumpin' Night in the Garden of Eden","key":"nT7VgDxjBPU","published_at":"2008-07-02T17:47:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a95c2f9c3a368118f005b4c"}]}}}
