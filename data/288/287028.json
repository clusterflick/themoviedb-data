From a rat infestation in the slums, a fast-spreading virus grips Hong Kong, inducing panic when the government is slow to react. Mercilessly cut down by censors for its frank portrayal of class and political conflicts at the time of its release, the film found new critical acclaim in during the SARS outbreak decades later. In 2011, it was placed on Hong Kong Film Archive’s list of the 100 must-see Hong Kong films of all time.","popularity":0.3098,"poster_path":"/idwoe3yvtCmrdEd6YAazvl0XE7a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eng Wah & Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1970-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"瘟疫","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Yesterday Today Tomorrow","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Chang Chung","original_name":"張沖","popularity":0.4796,"profile_path":"/pIyhvE3PyKaDl9cahuWzQXKm9FT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Paul Cheung","credit_id":"53ef3bb6c3a3685af2000ee1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Chang","original_name":"Yang Chang","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Xie Wei-Xian","credit_id":"5be9433b92514143e0036462","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":987137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Sit Ka-Yin","original_name":"薛家燕","popularity":0.4396,"profile_path":"/vaa8WG3iml4ZNbBwXJFiXqtIcyH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Law Tsui-Kam","credit_id":"5c97f2db0e0a264cc6c19e1b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Tsang","original_name":"曾江","popularity":0.7206,"profile_path":"/aq7XLUzruedjRFI3Zk0PZyubsYv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Health Department Chief Zhou","credit_id":"53ef3be9c3a3685ae7000f59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Chu Kong","original_name":"Paul Chu Kong","popularity":0.417,"profile_path":"/wQGNPHgGOr1g1lwhcKRgi8hMNJl.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ah Ken","credit_id":"657084ee41ad8d06e1865fdc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":548053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Law Lan","original_name":"羅蘭","popularity":0.778,"profile_path":"/fRKqfqmZgjfMdxoSQl5zZLsr4Bd.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Song's Sister-in-Law","credit_id":"657094d579a1c300fe780dbd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Lung","original_name":"Kong Lung","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/oAEt5kke5pYczZ9602An7IJiLfq.jpg","credit_id":"53ef3bf9c3a3685af8000e39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001851,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Albert Camus","original_name":"Albert Camus","popularity":0.1341,"profile_path":"/pOFEkfGDCQ3wQrC8Y9YuDcYpf3Z.jpg","credit_id":"53ef3c0fc3a3685aed000e37","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689012,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Goh Eng Wah","original_name":"Goh Eng Wah","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582f7a55c3a3683b050048b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lee Kia In","original_name":"Lee Kia In","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582f7a62c3a3683b02004e90","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Lung","original_name":"Kong Lung","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/oAEt5kke5pYczZ9602An7IJiLfq.jpg","credit_id":"582f7b23c3a3683af0004bc7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0193663","wikidata_id":"Q123354344","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/idwoe3yvtCmrdEd6YAazvl0XE7a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
