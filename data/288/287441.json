While the voice-over recites facts and names, photos take us into the past and the everyday lives of the people. The second part takes us to Greece in 1965, where the masses are protesting against the removal of the liberal Georgios Papandreou. – Two years later the military junta seized power in Greece. When Filmecho/Filmwoche called the film “communist”, it was doomed. It was rarely shown and originated the stigma that ultimately made it impossible for Peter Nestler to continue to work in Germany.","popularity":0.0925,"poster_path":"/76KR1V4dKwBCE7nHv7zloQIozYt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Greece","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"53f264f90e0a2675bc00650d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013999,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Reinald Schnell","original_name":"Reinald Schnell","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59817d8cc3a3680caa00ddf7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"59817da0c3a3680ceb00f276","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"59817d5e92514151e700f1c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27439,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Míkis Theodorakis","original_name":"Μίκης Θεοδωράκης","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/i89gSLWQlTKvxtORF1UwzIoMjxG.jpg","credit_id":"646c89b833a3760101fc5e56","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"5f0f8ee8a1074b003738f668","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1448618","wikidata_id":"Q35805648","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x4ETM4smjaE9XG9qpFVr1yBRQOO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/76KR1V4dKwBCE7nHv7zloQIozYt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
