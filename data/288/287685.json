They’ve been paying him his pension all this time, unaware that his former landlords have been cashing the checks.  When, one day, the assistant head of the bakery, Tony, pays a visit to Meiseken’s place to get a hold of an old recipe, someone’s got to play the part of Meiseken!  The fraud blows up in the landlords’ faces; but in the end, Tony gets the recipe book and even a new bride.","popularity":0.2331,"poster_path":"/bie98Rby1JnJUnGmHuOP69sb7ww.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29546,"logo_path":null,"name":"F.D.F.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1937-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meiseken","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Eichheim","original_name":"Josef Eichheim","popularity":0.1799,"profile_path":"/lXt1MWiAQKZJuDUk2vLy7cWXj5G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Alois Brüggler, Kleinbauer","credit_id":"53f3d3f20e0a267f7a000011","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rotraut Richter","original_name":"Rotraut Richter","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hedwig, Brügglers Enkelin","credit_id":"53f3d40a0e0a267f80000012","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Kampers","original_name":"Fritz Kampers","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/yiSZ1ZMztKK9XIRhQl2z8EdDT0n.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sebastian Huber, Gastwirt","credit_id":"53f3d42a0e0a267f86000024","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Aulinger, Handwerker","credit_id":"53f3d4380e0a267f8900000f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beppo Brem","original_name":"Beppo Brem","popularity":0.1826,"profile_path":"/Auj6DTOiNgAYUBxhfPQ8sQpqtOB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Michel, Knecht","credit_id":"53f3d44e0e0a267f86000027","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Berger","original_name":"Josef Berger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gendarm","credit_id":"53f3d45d0e0a267f8d000020","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Peukert","original_name":"Leo Peukert","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/dLBwA8lKrFzKCSq1n2UiwV9hJTN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hämmerleins Bürodiener","credit_id":"5abd6e61c3a3685c530005a2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":591219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susi Lanner","original_name":"Susi Lanner","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Ursula Meiseken","credit_id":"5ad350c592514173700261d9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Pohl","original_name":"Klaus Pohl","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/7w1iGL6f1pnNBj2SUn6TbSwUQgu.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5ad350d60e0a266c1f02a9b6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Reithofer","original_name":"Josef Reithofer","popularity":0.3219,"profile_path":"/8jArQYqjpT8MwWH7FwxjZj85gd5.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Hämmerleins Abteilungsdirektor","credit_id":"5b105aaa9251415ee900ce45","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Deppe","original_name":"Hans Deppe","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/4izzHQgMQFCfxmaf8QSOOsHvWB0.jpg","credit_id":"53f3d3d70e0a267f7a00000d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354850,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anderl Kern","original_name":"Anderl Kern","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6daf030e0a265efb01d49f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630599,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Wallner","original_name":"Max Wallner","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6daf36c3a3685562019a39","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738060,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Walter Sieber","original_name":"Walter Sieber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6daf450e0a265f0101c5d0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029227","wikidata_id":"Q6810314","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bie98Rby1JnJUnGmHuOP69sb7ww.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
