Before he leaves, his father asks him for a meeting. Consul Leuchtenthal wants to get his son a \"good\" marriage before he disappears overseas. The old man has the very young, attractive Christine von Auffenberg in mind, who runs a breeding farm for chinchillas. This would fit in well with the consul's business, as he earns good money as a fur trader. Ernst is not too keen on marrying a woman his father has chosen for him, especially as he does not love Christine. In the local children's home he meets the light-blonde Marianne, and for him it is like love at first sight.","popularity":0.4625,"poster_path":"/eQRGUONxk8B30Xvr2zVmDrMnRHL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30107,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra
