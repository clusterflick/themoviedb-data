'Saudade' is the portrait of a threshold: the end of high school, which we experience through Miguel. Set amidst the backdrop of the Ecuadorian economic crisis of 1999, 'Saudade' tackles notions of economic dislocation, friendship, family and young love while juxtaposing the crumbling of Miguel's life, against the crumbling of his country.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/1CFSYMfnIB2PoTR67TJashbZm0d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2014-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saudade","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019669,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Zapata","original_name":"Jorge Zapata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655533a09653f613f8645bfc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Carlos Donoso Gómez","original_name":"Juan Carlos Donoso Gómez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5RWwSyUmZ8Y5Wo2WJMtOKx31pUm.jpg","credit_id":"59515b80c3a368134a00f049","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037482,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergio Venturini","original_name":"Sergio Venturini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23382c397df000149b6447","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Micaela Rueda","original_name":"Micaela Rueda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e233844397df000129b1d82","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2512952,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sarahi Echeverria","original_name":"Sarahi Echeverria","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2336eb2811a10017a489cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Carlos Donoso Gómez","original_name":"Juan Carlos Donoso Gómez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5RWwSyUmZ8Y5Wo2WJMtOKx31pUm.jpg","credit_id":"5e2338141bf2660012f8ad77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1994468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Silva","original_name":"Julia Silva","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/ogOIuSgNlVfLGNwucSCzySSFUoq.jpg","credit_id":"5e23385abfeb8b0013d18a31","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3257022","wikidata_id":"Q18709378","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1CFSYMfnIB2PoTR67TJashbZm0d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
