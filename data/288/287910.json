These lyrical fragments sweep in and out as with the tides; a time-based symmetry slowly emerges as the film reveals itself to be a perfect circle.","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":"/eO5vh0KlTLPXOSzoIylMDZshb07.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mouches Volantes","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Elective Affinities II","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Gottheim","original_name":"Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y6YJWdMk6006kMVK1CwZXWtD713.jpg","credit_id":"53f5cb4dc3a36833f40036ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8531474","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eO5vh0KlTLPXOSzoIylMDZshb07.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Whitney Museum of American Art","release_date":"1976-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
