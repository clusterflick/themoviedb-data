They live on the distant Tureia island in the French Polynesia, Pacific Ocean and have just been told that something is wrong with their son Maokis heart. It is a consequence of living only 100 km away from the island of Moruroa, where France has tested 193 atom bombs for 30 years. Several of their family members are sick and Moruroa can soon collapse, which can lead to a tsunami likely to drown all of them. Vive La France is a personal and intimate story about harvesting the consequences of the French atomic program.","popularity":0.8385,"poster_path":"/lcfkLrOHnj3EMnkiQeYDzkFlfIA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2014-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vive La France","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kua","original_name":"Kua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"53f3427bc3a3685ad9007145","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teariki","original_name":"Teariki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53f34283c3a3685aed006c07","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354587,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Titti Johnson","original_name":"Titti Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f34237c3a3685ae7006ea6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helgi Felixson","original_name":"Helgi Felixson","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f34226c3a3685add006aca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helgi Felixson","original_name":"Helgi Felixson","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f34204c3a3685ae2006b7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354587,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Titti Johnson","original_name":"Titti Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f3421ac3a3685ad900713d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3527010","wikidata_id":"Q23419294","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bNZ1qxAQrysZ98LqQBmRb0OF9bT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lcfkLrOHnj3EMnkiQeYDzkFlfIA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6038,"name":"marriage"},{"id":12551,"name":"nuclear bomb"},{"id":156630,"name":"remote island"},{"id":166450,"name":"south pacific"},{"id":180803,"name":"polynesia"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
