He sells his field and uses the money to buy a broken-down old Peugeot 504 from an European couple. Boubacar wants to try his hand at being a bush taxi driver. But very soon, he sees that his dream cannot become reality : the engine of the old jalopy dies on him. Boubacar is ruined. His wife is forced into prostitution in the corn fields to meet the family's needs. But Boubacar is a resourceful, philosophical man. He strips the car down and uses the engine of the 504 as a barbecue to sell grilled corn in the streets. His hopes of being rich are renewed.","popularity":0.1079,"poster_path":"/uoIisbx6l4yCj0GFcrYSQqGPNW8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tabou-Tabac Films","origin_country":"BJ"},{"id":30207,"logo_path":"/tkZkUdRNysbqGCRFsvM14USFlti.png","name":"45 RDLC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BJ","name":"Benin"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peugeot Barbecue","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":308731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Odoutan","original_name":"Jean Odoutan","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/4smENRcwYwpTB7jJ3tO6MNIuS6K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Boubacar","credit_id":"53f0e7ac0e0a2675b8003ba2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1353841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurentine Milebo","original_name":"Laurentine Milebo","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/yGSfawXvhHNVXZoQMRuXU0ZKq4b.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fati","credit_id":"53f0e7b80e0a2675bc0039fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Agboliagbo","original_name":"Gladys Agboliagbo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rafia","credit_id":"53f0e7c60e0a2675b8003ba8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Agboliagbo","original_name":"Olivia Agboliagbo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Djita","credit_id":"53f0e7d50e0a2675a9003ba8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Dorlipo","original_name":"Didier Dorlipo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Didier-Djack (Nuhuru)","credit_id":"53f0e7e60e0a2675af003b55","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adama Kouyaté","original_name":"Adama Kouyaté","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Vieil édenté","credit_id":"53f0e7fd0e0a2675bc003a04","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koffi Gahou","original_name":"Koffi Gahou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Beau-frère Boubacar","credit_id":"53f0e8110e0a2675bc003a0c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Odoutan","original_name":"Roland Odoutan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Camara","credit_id":"53f0e81d0e0a2675b8003bbe","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Houngbo","original_name":"Claire Houngbo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Tante","credit_id":"53f0e8280e0a2675ac0039f5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chimène Agboliagbo","original_name":"Chimène Agboliagbo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Fifi","credit_id":"53f0e8350e0a2675ac0039fc","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Sallan","original_name":"Guy Sallan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"El Hadj Traoré","credit_id":"53f0e8470e0a2675b2003c37","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":308731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Odoutan","original_name":"Jean Odoutan","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/4smENRcwYwpTB7jJ3tO6MNIuS6K.jpg","credit_id":"53f0e78d0e0a2675b8003b9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":308731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Odoutan","original_name":"Jean Odoutan","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/4smENRcwYwpTB7jJ3tO6MNIuS6K.jpg","credit_id":"53f0e7960e0a2675a9003b99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0229234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8JilJP3FH6bhBxEEz8DpyzgUxpL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uoIisbx6l4yCj0GFcrYSQqGPNW8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
