The relationship between a career criminal and a blind girl (a stunning performance by Josephine Siao) form a portrait of marginalized life in a rapidly-modernizing Hong Kong. The profound chemistry between Patrick Tse and Josephine Siao onscreen served as the primary inspiration for the famed hit man-blind girl pairing in John Woo’s award-winning film The Killer (1989).","popularity":0.181,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tse Brother's Motion Picture Production Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1968-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Tse Yin","original_name":"謝賢","popularity":0.6409,"profile_path":"/5neIbXmuvtdQIygHu6D2wighYwW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Yeh Hsia","credit_id":"53ef33b2c3a3685af2000e3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Siao Fong-Fong","original_name":"Josephine Siao Fong-Fong","popularity":0.3757,"profile_path":"/aO8CRYiKw8UwoW27okaEjUmghT9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Liu Lu Ming","credit_id":"53ef33c0c3a3685aff000e51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Lung","original_name":"Kong Lung","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/oAEt5kke5pYczZ9602An7IJiLfq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Inspector Lu","credit_id":"53ef33c9c3a3685add000dce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheng Yee","original_name":"Cheng Yee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ta Niu","credit_id":"57fe9d4b9251411428006b28","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mang Lee","original_name":"Mang Lee","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sophia","credit_id":"57fe9d68925141154e0066a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1397650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lin Jing","original_name":"Lin Jing","popularity":0.3024,"profile_path":"/x291dpHL1D7LRrQrlGtVbJA6xJl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sister Li","credit_id":"57fe9d9dc3a3681de600a940","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Lung","original_name":"Kong Lung","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/oAEt5kke5pYczZ9602An7IJiLfq.jpg","credit_id":"53ef33d9c3a3685add000dd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566149,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lam Wa-Chiu","original_name":"Lam Wa-Chiu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fe9dfbc3a368523d0065b6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72434,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sung Ming","original_name":"Sung Ming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fe9f17c3a368528500550a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693658,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luk Hua Chun","original_name":"Luk Hua Chun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fe9fd6925141154e006798","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Tse Yin","original_name":"謝賢","popularity":0.6409,"profile_path":"/5neIbXmuvtdQIygHu6D2wighYwW.jpg","credit_id":"57fe9cce92514114b300661a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Lung","original_name":"Kong Lung","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/oAEt5kke5pYczZ9602An7IJiLfq.jpg","credit_id":"57fe9fbd9251411514006352","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Suen A-Foo","original_name":"Suen A-Foo","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fe9fabc3a368523d006660","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0193060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1968-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
