He has a dream of opening a fast food restaurant for kids selling only pink and blue food. When his boss (Evan R. Press) tells him to spend a few days with the company's top seller, Stephanie (Gheree O'Bannon), he accidentally gets involved with an eccentric con woman named Verushka (Yelena Danova) instead.
