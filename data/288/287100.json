It sends him into a downward spiral of paranoia and doubt as he fumbles his way through the theatre of the absurd that we call life. Using humour and a playful tone, the film examines the fragility of human nature, when our bearings get lost and our imagination takes over, highlighting our common fears, doubts, hopes and resilience.","popularity":0.2454,"poster_path":"/eiFXZOoCAvRavyvZk4c6o1mebs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Breathe","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Faille","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacek Petrycki","original_name":"Jacek Petrycki","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296305a7e403d00668169d2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Rozenberg","original_name":"Paul Rozenberg","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296308a5a469072f666cd70","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3571069,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tornike Shengelia","original_name":"Tornike Shengelia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629630690f21c61539506019","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535156,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Octávio Espírito Santo","original_name":"Octávio Espírito Santo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296307409ed8f1253562787","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509258,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andro Sanovich","original_name":"Andro Sanovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62963061df86a834e233f6b6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597004,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heidi Fleisher","original_name":"Heidi Fleisher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62963084ca83541355cd814a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Grivel","original_name":"Philippe Grivel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296307c0f21c6153899d039","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Kirtadzé","original_name":"ნინო კირთაძე","popularity":0.2599,"profile_path":"/hh8M1iMxstDDUD2Jlsuv0Hp6E5v.jpg","credit_id":"53efab73c3a3685ad90018a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Kirtadzé","original_name":"ნინო კირთაძე","popularity":0.2599,"profile_path":"/hh8M1iMxstDDUD2Jlsuv0Hp6E5v.jpg","credit_id":"53efab80c3a3685ad90018a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3958034","wikidata_id":"Q18111970","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eiFXZOoCAvRavyvZk4c6o1mebs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
