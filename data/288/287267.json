He was unsuccessful in his mission to have the papal ban against his emperor lifted.  The young Walti, who works in the cloister, jokes with the cloister' cook, Severin, because Dietwald's cold stare scared him.  Severin rebukes him, saying that Dietwald has been carrying a heavy burden.  Once, Dietwald had his own fortress.  This, however, was destroyed during an attack and his wife killed.  Since then, he has not seen his daughter again.","popularity":0.1966,"poster_path":"/r6CCd41oGBbQljElzlPHvEjZUZf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tonlicht-Film GmbH, Peter Ostermayr (Berlin)","origin_country":""},{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1935-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Klosterjäger","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich Ulmer","original_name":"Friedrich Ulmer","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/4SDULBlzuab0T3PAtnzqn2Z2Q4y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Heinrich von Inzing","credit_id":"53f10ad50e0a2675a9003f24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Richter","original_name":"Paul Richter","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/8NxDkOULXevn2rgUysQQlB0VD90.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Haymo, der Klosterjäger","credit_id":"53f10ae40e0a2675a9003f27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Eichheim","original_name":"Josef Eichheim","popularity":0.1799,"profile_path":"/lXt1MWiAQKZJuDUk2vLy7cWXj5G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Schluttemann, der Vogt","credit_id":"53f10af80e0a2675a9003f29","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1958974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Radspieler","original_name":"Charlotte Radspieler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yZ2zINLzGeU5ghZmlg9d9lSyAya.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gitti","credit_id":"5a6da99d0e0a265f0401cd32","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Schaub","original_name":"Olga Schaub","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Josepha","credit_id":"5a6da9bc925141075d015bc4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Obal","original_name":"Max Obal","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f10ab60e0a2675b8003ef4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46840,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Francke","original_name":"Peter Francke","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6da86ec3a368554101bdf0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50920,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Roland","original_name":"Marc Roland","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6da8c2925141075d015ad4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228490","wikidata_id":"Q1194836","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r6CCd41oGBbQljElzlPHvEjZUZf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1935-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
