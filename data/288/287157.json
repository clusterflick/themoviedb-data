The Lapita Navigators. The proud forefathers of many cultures in the tropical Pacific. They are losing their homes and crops because of sea level rise. Their livelihood and culture are dramatically threatened as the islands they live on are flooding day by day. By chance, a sailor, Steve Goodall, came across them on his travels and discovered they knew nothing about the current forecasts for sea level rise. Once informed they asked for his help. The outcome and conclusion of this story will be told in the context of an event celebrating their living culture, a culture at a cross roads of great importance for all of us.","popularity":0.6242,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FM","name":"Micronesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Someplace with a Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chevy Chase","original_name":"Chevy Chase","popularity":1.9039,"profile_path":"/A1X2BvR8vEXvwXdJa5uYAYVCO2k.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"53f01055c3a3685af8001e44","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Goodall","original_name":"Steve Goodall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e729a568de0ae00135712a0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Goodall","original_name":"Steve Goodall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f00fafc3a3685aed001e7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353618,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gary Dini","original_name":"Gary Dini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f00fbac3a3685aff001f49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6372,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzanne Warren","original_name":"Suzanne Warren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f00fcec3a3685aed001e80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353619,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Terry Huntington","original_name":"Terry Huntington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f00ff3c3a3685ad9002299","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Goodall","original_name":"Steve Goodall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f00ffec3a3685add001e4e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Goodall","original_name":"Steve Goodall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f01007c3a3685aed001e88","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Russell Long","original_name":"Russell Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f0101bc3a3685ae2001e4d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353621,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Larry Huntington","original_name":"Larry Huntington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f0102ac3a3685ae7001f94","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Goodall","original_name":"Steve Goodall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72a713f9aa470019d21761","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1766101","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":911,"name":"exotic island"},{"id":33480,"name":"environmental"},{"id":166450,"name":"south pacific"},{"id":206509,"name":"sea rise"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
