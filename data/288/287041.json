A static camera depicts images of a pipe, clock, and smoke against a whitewashed brick wall. The superimposed titles were added in 1971, and include the labels ‘Figure I’ and ‘Figure II’, phrases that recur throughout Broodthaers oeuvre, and echo Magritte’s concern with the relationship between object, image and language.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ceci Ne Serait Pas Une Pipe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Broodthaers","original_name":"Marcel Broodthaers","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ef5221c3a3685ae70010ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0315372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
