His entire mission is put at risk when he kills a rival for her love, a French journalist and blackmailer. (This film was a heavily re-shot 76 minute version of the 1933 film Typhoon but with a dramatically altered plot from the original where the Japanese are now portrayed as unsympathetic villains. The new version was approved by German censors and released in 1934 although its critical reception was poor. It is possible that Wiene, who had left for Budapest in 1933 following the Nazi rise to power, did not personally work on the new version).
