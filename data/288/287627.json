Orpheus, who is able to defeat Hades with the power of art, is unable to conquer his own human defects. Amor is sympathetic to Orpheus' sufferings as he mourns his dead beloved, and lets him know the message sent by the Gods, namely that he may take her home from the underworld if he is capable of not looking at her.","popularity":0.142,"poster_path":"/8MK81ouysco8fe8wY1ekOF2jM9M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest
