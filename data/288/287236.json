Legislators are calling the shots and putting public schools in an ever-shrinking box. WLCSC Board of School Trustees and Superintendent of Schools, Rocky Killion, want to secure resources and legislative relief necessary to achieve the school district’s mission of creating a world-class educational system for all children. The school district’s strategic plan will introduce a model of education that puts decision making back into the hands of local communities and public school teachers, rather than leaving it in the hands of legislators and ultimately lining the pockets of corporations.","popularity":1.2924,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":30197,"logo_path":null,"name":"West Lafayette Schools Education Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":30196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Klink Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The next great ambition in public education, Rise Above the Mark, aims to make the United States a world leader once again.","title":"Rise Above the Mark","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Coyote","original_name":"Peter Coyote","popularity":1.5648,"profile_path":"/ld3xLYTcZWjAc0bE33DONT7n9o8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"53f0cd3a0e0a2675b50038c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Diane Ravitch","original_name":"Dr. Diane Ravitch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education and Education Historian","credit_id":"53f0cd550e0a2675bf00386b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond","original_name":"Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Charles Ducommun Professor of Education, Stanford University","credit_id":"53f0cd760e0a2675b50038cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Marc Tucker","original_name":"Dr. Marc Tucker","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"President and CEO of the National Center on Education and the Economy","credit_id":"53f0cd850e0a2675b2003992","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Pasi Sahlberg","original_name":"Dr. Pasi Sahlberg","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Director General of National Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation in the Ministry of Education in Helsinki, Finland","credit_id":"53f0cd980e0a2675b80038f3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Vollmer","original_name":"Jamie Vollmer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Author, speaker and supporter of public schools","credit_id":"53f0cdaf0e0a2675a9003923","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Klink","original_name":"Jack Klink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f0d09fc3a3685aed002bd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1447,"name":"indiana, usa"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":10873,"name":"school"},{"id":158671,"name":"public school"},{"id":161779,"name":"corporate take over"},{"id":193547,"name":"teachers and students"},{"id":206512,"name":"public education"},{"id":206515,"name":"usa politics"},{"id":206516,"name":"west lafayette, india"},{"id":206517,"name":"indiana public schools"},{"id":206519,"name":"corporatization"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rise Above the Mark -
