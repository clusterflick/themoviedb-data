At that time, tensions were rising within the education system: CEGEPs and universities were being occupied by students. In this climate of protest, the students of the École des beaux-arts seized control of their institution and declared self-management, establishing the “Republic of the Beaux-Arts” — a collective creation reinvented day by day; a true living cultural manifesto.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La république des Beaux-Arts - La malédiction de la momie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Laflamme","original_name":"Claude Laflamme","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6907ba6bc30a49727b463ee8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvie Lapointe","original_name":"Sylvie Lapointe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6907ba7fc8900d7b40472ad5","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
