She is accompanied by Dandy Andy, a middle-aged man dressed like Abe Lincoln. After gliding upon a magical trunk, they reach a world of whimsy, complete with kooky contraptions, calliope music, rope tricks, and stories which are told with hand-drawn cartoon illustrations. (Apparently, there was no budget for actual animation.) When Polly pulls an onion out of her pocket, she’s reminded of an adventure at the Castle of Gloom, where character actor Percy Helton is a henchman, and she’s arrested for being happy and sent to the onion dungeon.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nKIWZLhUqGAxDwR19mMG6HY9c0o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polly Pockets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nKIWZLhUqGAxDwR19mMG6HY9c0o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
