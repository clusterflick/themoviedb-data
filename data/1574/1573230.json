In her community near Mühldorf, she has helped deliver almost all of the village's residents, and she can still remember each of the approximately 6,000 births. For twenty years, she worked with her mother in her maternity home—mostly around the clock and without a day off. After her mother's death, she was one of the first to start performing home births in the early 1980s, initially for eco-warriors, anthroposophists, dropouts, and women's rights activists. Paula is still working today in her daughter's midwifery practice, which is now in its sixth generation of bringing future Obertaufkirchen residents into the world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hebamm is a Hebamm bis zum Schluss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Seidl","original_name":"Julia Seidl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690725a3783661a1262fe8ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Munich International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2002-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
