In a country where more than 850,000 Deaf people receive little institutional support, silence becomes both a barrier and a form of connection. Through classrooms, homes, and everyday life, the film observes a community building its own means of understanding and belonging. Among those leading the way are Melkin, Dairy, and Jonathan, the teachers, students, and leaders within Guatemalan Deaf Ministries, where the language of hands has become the language of hope.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":279160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brooklawn Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A look at Guatemala’s Deaf community as they build connection and identity through their own language.","title":"Sin Voz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melkin","original_name":"Melkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6906cd47c8fbe205e9463d93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dairy","original_name":"Dairy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"herself","credit_id":"6906cd501329dee76a5980cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan","original_name":"Jonathan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6906cd599a3969e4a8597ec3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Grant Knaus","original_name":"John Grant Knaus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906cc12ad482181ac081254","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790365,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex zhort","original_name":"Alex zhort","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906cc2482f0402fb1e129dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790367,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zack Millsaps","original_name":"Zack Millsaps","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906cc6e82f0402fb1e129f3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5403277,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Connor Futch","original_name":"Connor Futch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906cc8df5c0a7b3f64639cf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Grant Knaus","original_name":"John Grant Knaus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906cc9cfc643cca74dd825c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5790364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Grant Knaus","original_name":"John Grant Knaus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906ccad145ccbe0b12fe649","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38796837","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1643,"name":"deaf"},{"id":163092,"name":"guatemala"},{"id":188953,"name":"sign languages"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
