The filmmakers map the local execution sites, study historical records, and visit the places where these gallows once stood. The aim is to find out whether only silent traces of the past remain in these places, or something more that cannot be rationally explained.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey into a dark chapter of South Moravian history where life and death were decided under the open sky","title":"Šibenice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
