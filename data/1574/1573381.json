Filmed out of a moving car, the landscape appears monotonous, the repetitive succession of rivers, fields and trees only interrupted by electrical masts, bridges and roads. The title of the film, Monotony is Nice (Monotonie ist schön), refers beyond the recordings as such, since monotony, regularity and repetition are also the basic principles of Posenenske’s creative process.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monotonie ist schön","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
