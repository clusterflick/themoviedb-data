It was produced by Gilmour and Charlie Andrew. Gilmour's wife, novelist Polly Samson, wrote most of the lyrics, which she said addressed mortality and aging. Their children contributed additional vocals, lyrics and instrumentation. The song \"Luck and Strange\" features keyboards recorded in 2007 by the Pink Floyd keyboardist, Richard Wright, who died in 2008. The album also features a cover of the 1999 song \"Between Two Points\", originally by the British band the Montgolfier Brothers. This release includes Dolby Atmos and high-resolution stereo mixes plus four bonus tracks.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4WyVQHPhXORfs305aTCkARjIVcw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Gilmour: Luck And Strange","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gilmour","original_name":"David Gilmour","popularity":0.7687,"profile_path":"/n1KOcuMSdNHY0pewz6fEWl6zHYD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - guitar, piano, lead vocals","credit_id":"6907c592ea482b28582feb5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367506,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Eno","original_name":"Roger Eno","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":"/xfo23Dk2ujRVkjWfaLUt3z6gHdG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - piano","credit_id":"6907c623022e519fe12fec51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":220903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Pratt","original_name":"Guy Pratt","popularity":0.3207,"profile_path":"/lb4yPXRboPumVqm26nykWipNHhN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - bass guitar","credit_id":"6907c64c145ccbe0b12feabe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4953085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Betts","original_name":"Adam Betts","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - percussion, djembe, drums","credit_id":"6907c686ea482b28582feb88","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve DiStanislao","original_name":"Steve DiStanislao","popularity":0.0796,"profile_path":"/gleC3eaZ8a9kn5ta5N3C5MCnh3V.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - drums","credit_id":"6907c6a8b15b07b06ee1300f","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q125582617","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3x6ExKTA37GJg2YDOknze4zsnO0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4WyVQHPhXORfs305aTCkARjIVcw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
