Guided by rapper and spoken-word artist Séamus Barra Ó Súilleabháin, a group of teenagers channel personal histories and cultural pride into original work that speaks to identity, belonging and resilience. More than just a recording studio inside a metal container, The Kabin emerges as a sanctuary of self-expression and solidarity, showing creativity’s power to reshape how young people see themselves and their language, and their world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gealtra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Canty","original_name":"Brendan Canty","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":"/40Gw1Xx0C7XuI5rNASVD8I8LgaZ.jpg","credit_id":"6906b5551be149ee3de12a97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ybKj4ztWb8zgCF8ldukZxKY2PLb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14985,"name":"ireland"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":267698,"name":"irish language"},{"id":309684,"name":"cork"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gealtra - Teaser Clip","key":"UVipzjZ5YeQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-10-16T16:52:47.000Z","id":"6906b50bc9e03067f7463a4b"}]}}}
