Set in a quiet Kenyan university, the film follows a young student caught between two worlds - the material allure of an older, persuasive suitor, and the intellectual awakening sparked by a classmate who challenges her to define her own meaning in life. Through a minimalist yet emotionally charged encounter, the story explores the value of knowledge, identity, and the silent test of self-worth that every soul must face - the blank page.","popularity":0.3071,"poster_path":"/6M29DG7mWr7xtgP2Ve0g2tSRcZt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270566,"logo_path":"/4oplIe92VmeEMEYXhdSbQrNIHC.png","name":"Lohkast","origin_country":"KE"},{"id":270565,"logo_path":"/uhw4Kq1maJ1zGcJukkGijQ9prH0.png","name":"Lohkast Pictures","origin_country":"KE"},{"id":270569,"logo_path":"/5vAXnx5AA3eJ7fZEOurZS8LRyws.png","name":"Lohkast Records","origin_country":"KE"},{"id":270567,"logo_path":"/v6MrqBwY85FkzLnbnQpK5KRqCSF.png","name":"Lohkast Audio","origin_country":"KE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fill it or don't, the choice is yours.","title":"Life's A Blank Page","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Suitor","credit_id":"6907e671c8900d7b40472bc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5792154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Wanjiru","original_name":"Michelle Wanjiru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Student","credit_id":"6907e6bace5dbdaec6598769","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072161,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Brian Samuels","original_name":"Brian Samuels","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Class Student","credit_id":"6907e72ad722e2eec64c8adc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"6907e75f01ad2aefe14c8874","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"6907e7775f980ebe26472c9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"6907e799863b56dbeddd8626","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"6907e7e4145ccbe0b12febc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5792170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seth Kiroso","original_name":"Seth Kiroso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6907e7fe3db6c50eb3472d0a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5792172,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian samuel","original_name":"Brian samuel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6907e83c18cfd0ed9a472ce8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5792154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Wanjiru","original_name":"Michelle Wanjiru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6907e85814c2d273e24c8a36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"6907e88cbb0103f3870817bd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5792170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seth Kiroso","original_name":"Seth Kiroso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6907e8aa22e808726a5982c6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38705080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"ongigejames","instagram_id":"ongigejames","twitter_id":"jamesongige"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":767,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LrE6mP7m1qAqyo3mcBWdntRkmC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6M29DG7mWr7xtgP2Ve0g2tSRcZt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":325761,"name":"admiring"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
