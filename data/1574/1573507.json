Using CG animated elements and simulations, the body on screen sometimes resembles a human body, sometimes the body of a plant or tree, and in other moments a fossil-like structure from an indeterminate time. The work,  which has both Video and augmented reality elements, was commissioned by PCAI - Polygreen Culture & Art Initiative and was part of the show 'Sheltered Gardens', Athens, 2022.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/v6obpMr0rmCdspYcf6ogRnefFf1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"​Strong, Feeble, Unfixed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5791682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Papamargariti","original_name":"Eva Papamargariti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fXFQz5juQtk6J53PkjKwv7pUEFi.jpg","credit_id":"6907b8f4863b56dbeddd858a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1728,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v6obpMr0rmCdspYcf6ogRnefFf1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
