Navigating through all her timelines, she explores her endless possibilities of her destinies.  Introducing in a new montage form, a collage of in-concluded narratives, The Kingdom of Fairies weaves fragments inspired by the fleeting aesthetics and unfinished narratives of TikTok and short-reel culture. The film drifts through the emotional urgency and spectacle of perfection that define our hyperconnected age, where love becomes simulation, heartbreak becomes performance, and identity becomes mimicry shaped by algorithmic desire. In a world numbed by excess, the longing to rediscover magic and the freedom to feel becomes a quiet act of resistance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"the kingdom of fairies","title":"the kingdom of fairies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
