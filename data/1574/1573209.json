Black pine, in particular, is considered especially productive in its later years. In Hernstein, the old tradition of resin tapping has been preserved. The resin from here is considered among the best in the world and is used, among other things, to make ointments. Director Wolfgang Niedermair accompanied the people here and documented their lives in harmony with nature. He portrays a hard but also fulfilling profession, one that is practiced by only a few today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Kraft des Waldes - Die letzten Pecher von Hernstein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
