The video unfolds as a dialogue between a human and a zoomorphic AI being, each examining the other’s roots, traces, and intentions. At times they experience unease and a sense of threat, yet moments of recognition and mutual understanding occasionally emerge. In these brief encounters, the fear of invasion dissolves, giving way to the possibility of a shared, interdependent ecosystem.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8QnVFESi0PI6AogoXlu6BQJb2ST.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"​Precarious Inhabitants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5791682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Papamargariti","original_name":"Eva Papamargariti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fXFQz5juQtk6J53PkjKwv7pUEFi.jpg","credit_id":"6907b6c1410d559b8a4c857c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":1136,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8QnVFESi0PI6AogoXlu6BQJb2ST.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":862}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
