The police learn that jewel thieves are planning to knock over the Wilson gem collection, and the brothers take precautions. One evening, Marie Duquesne, dressed as a bride, appeals to the brothers to help her avoid a distasteful marriage to an old man. The brothers let her stay the night; Mortimer resents her presence, but Wilson falls in love with her. The following morning, the butler tells Wilson that, suspicious of Marie's nocturnal prowling, he has called the police; and a policeman soon arrives and takes her into custody. That night the butler is prevented from looting the safe by Marie, who has returned to the house. Marie, who is a detective, sees to the arrest of the butler and then turns her attentions to Wilson.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Danger Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016763","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
