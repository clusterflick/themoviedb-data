Yung, its associate producer and cinematographer, joined the surveillance team of the Narcotics Bureau to acquaint himself with the workings of the drug trade. This paved the way for The System. In addition to the cat-and-mouse game between the cops and the druglord, a fascinating thread traces the relationship among dealers, junkies and mules in Sai Ying Pun. The title hails from Brecht’s The Threepenny Opera, another tragedy concerned with a capitalist society’s oppressed and exploited nobodies.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1976-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opium: The White Powder Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Cowell","original_name":"Adrian Cowell","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690749c0091934fd3708149f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Yung Wai-Chuen","original_name":"Peter Yung Wai-Chuen","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690749d383237f8d55472a59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
