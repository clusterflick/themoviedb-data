Shot in 2006, scored over the next few years, and released on VHS in 2012, is a slow-cooked music video manifestation of Zignoto’s ongoing music project Slobberkiss Intl. Zignoto describes the film as an aggregate of visuals they were fascinated with, and collecting onto video, in a time before they had social media platforms at their disposal for sharing. While living in Louisville, Kentucky, Alan (or ‘Al N’, ‘Arsenio’, ‘Raw Thug’) collaborated with multiple groups of the improvisational and genre-escaping DIY midwest landscape, including Softcheque, Sapat, Kark, and others. The film offers a casual, pedestrian, almost ambient glimpse into the suburban environments of Louisville, set to experimental, sometimes casiotone, musical accompaniment.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homeopathic Remedies for Blindness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5789781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Zignoto","original_name":"Alan Zignoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690678bf45b7cae6c8463b21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
