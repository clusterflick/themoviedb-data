Befriended by a heavy-drinking reporter named Jack Rawson, Helen rises to the position of advice-to-the-lovelorn columnist. One night Helen is assigned to a missing-girl story, and Jack promises to accompany her. However, he gets drunk instead, and later, awakening from a stupor, he stumbles upon the scene of a murder. Slipping into unconsciousness again, Jack awakens the next morning to find himself accused of the killing. Helen, with the aid of one of her lovelorn letters, investigates the story and uncovers the real murderer. Jack reforms and Helen takes him home to meet her mother.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deadline at Eleven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0011099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
