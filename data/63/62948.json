The film is told in 4 stories by 3 filmmakers. Three of the stories deal with married couples of various ages confronting the turning points of their relationships. A fourth story is interwoven throughout, providing bookends and context in the form of a story about ten year old twins, who, tired of sharing their bedroom set out to build a wall between their beds to create their own spaces. In building the wall to separate, they come to fully appreciate all things that connect them. Bedrooms explores human relationships, their myriad complications and the daily choice we face to either make them work or to move on.","popularity":2.0628,"poster_path":"/7pp0JKc5UnfBamPgE2VKPGwqERm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Lies Behind Closed Doors","title":"Bedrooms","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Belfi","original_name":"Jordan Belfi","popularity":0.4941,"profile_path":"/n5hN1Ik6gKGiX5xVpFUMeTjdGED.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Julian","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Benz","original_name":"Julie Benz","popularity":1.8511,"profile_path":"/avcCYkQjRM7qgE0MZ5VXcK3XcKz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xander Berkeley","original_name":"Xander Berkeley","popularity":1.328,"profile_path":"/oBoKGfngGGZmSVGFslphYjc23WO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Bloodgood","original_name":"Moon Bloodgood","popularity":0.994,"profile_path":"/9CGOg5nGFlQ3IWwbElMAEJMm9Iq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Beth","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Bostwick","original_name":"Barry Bostwick","popularity":1.1741,"profile_path":"/z2jlL5g5PMxelSHMXFF03fTSsLl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Roger","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Clarke","original_name":"Sarah Clarke","popularity":1.2283,"profile_path":"/bClQYkwMBVnXrVRs52TFbqX3oVE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Janet","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Garcia","original_name":"Jesse Garcia","popularity":0.8239,"profile_path":"/eyPXWMPoJATwiOW40uJ8Kk1irM7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sal","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987f5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Kelly","original_name":"Kurt Kelly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987f9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enn Reitel","original_name":"Enn Reitel","popularity":0.3757,"profile_path":"/eTLCNbqkj5ZlIGgXenVPMZ3qRYQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Walter","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e0987fd","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maury Rogow","original_name":"Maury Rogow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"John","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e098801","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Sprayberry","original_name":"Dylan Sprayberry","popularity":0.836,"profile_path":"/buzNvV8K6PpCsGg0bVfbW82wHmq.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Max","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e098805","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":209225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellery Sprayberry","original_name":"Ellery Sprayberry","popularity":0.3134,"profile_path":"/3fnTvcleXkzyIAaiqLJX0ICnYTX.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Daisy","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e098809","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee Wallace","original_name":"Dee Wallace","popularity":1.217,"profile_path":"/gVnwovXGgGcny8LJ3w9j3I9xTE7.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Marnie","credit_id":"52fe4695c3a368484e09880d","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1249819,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"The Angel","original_name":"The Angel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ajFtvVxcMygApnC0CCLz6yTDvsx.jpg","credit_id":"601c5e767ad08c0041dfa573","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1390533","wikidata_id":"Q4879417","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7pp0JKc5UnfBamPgE2VKPGwqERm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
