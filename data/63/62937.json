They watch some animals reproduce before being ushered into the Emerald City by singing suits of armor and a lavish parade of overweight cops before meeting the Wizard, a devious little man who transforms eggs into uncontrollable forms, much to Billina's dismay.","popularity":0.5737,"poster_path":"/kI2VTnfiumP9Du9xoHTKP2c0OCu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78825,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ted Eshbaugh Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":120795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Laboratories of Canada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wizard of Oz","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El mago de Oz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Eshbaugh","original_name":"Ted Eshbaugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4694c3a368484e0986a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Joslyn Baum","original_name":"Frank Joslyn Baum","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9df461e22d28001b62f7eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
