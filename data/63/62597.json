The odyssey is a homecoming for singer Chhom Nimol and a transformation for the rest of the band as they perform with master musicians and record new songs along the way. More than a rockumentary, the film serves up a portrait of modern Cambodia as the band tours through Phnom Penh and beyond, crossing a great cultural chasm with the same spirit of Cambodia's original rock pioneers.","popularity":0.274,"poster_path":"/7KrqDTlbLRFnvytDxE455lmINS9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleepwalking Through The Mekong","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Holtzman","original_name":"Ethan Holtzman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4684c3a368484e094f5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zac Holtzman","original_name":"Zac Holtzman","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4684c3a368484e094f61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chhom Nimol","original_name":"Chhom Nimol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4684c3a368484e094f65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ralicke","original_name":"David Ralicke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4684c3a368484e094f69","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Dreux Smith","original_name":"Paul Dreux Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4684c3a368484e094f6d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Senon Gaus Williams","original_name":"Senon Gaus Williams","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4684c3a368484e094f71","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235578,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Pirozzi","original_name":"John Pirozzi","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4684c3a368484e094f59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1024995","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KrqDTlbLRFnvytDxE455lmINS9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
