McLaglen plays Big Tim Channing, an ageing but powerful gangster who raises young newsboy Dan Mason as his own son. Upon reaching adulthood, Mason (John Baer) becomes a law student, with the covert (and illegal) help of Channing. Despite his checkered past, Mason opts for honesty when he falls in love with Fern Fellows (Kathleen Crowley). This decision ultimately spells the doom for Mason's mentor Big Tim.","popularity":1.6261,"poster_path":"/2PDGg2mtk92fs3bicTKVbzOaCPc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The inside story of a criminal empire spawned on city streets...its laws executed in back alleys in bullets and blood","title":"City of Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor McLaglen","original_name":"Victor McLaglen","popularity":0.4535,"profile_path":"/vYj8mVtT8CgQOHH8eRNMl7pA7F1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Big Tim Channing","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Baer","original_name":"John Baer","popularity":0.1574,"profile_path":"/3DYdyMZqIjQOOad2tMqvnXOwlAn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dan Mason","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Crowley","original_name":"Kathleen Crowley","popularity":0.5407,"profile_path":"/rakzWrmqwJtHSfmpr5Lcji4fzAX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Fern Fellows","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Caruso","original_name":"Anthony Caruso","popularity":0.7058,"profile_path":"/8eDPQrngmyQW8NrNbZ9oOfOM9ti.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tony Finetti","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Vincent","original_name":"June Vincent","popularity":0.3225,"profile_path":"/uBAv5zckQ9N4y39TkU274SmfIWY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Linda Fairaday","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d47","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Reeves","original_name":"Richard Reeves","popularity":0.5511,"profile_path":"/wDWCY3RbEyDMfO58RwRwV2diEX.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Angelo Di Bruno","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d4b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Maxey","original_name":"Paul Maxey","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/AnJk4FnJ64z4Xw9nuv9rGApeEX1.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Davis, Disbarred Lawyer","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d4f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Ferguson","original_name":"Frank Ferguson","popularity":0.6918,"profile_path":"/u71gKHci5XMUrpOou8peFEYphXM.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"District Attorney Hunt","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d53","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Travis","original_name":"Richard Travis","popularity":0.1517,"profile_path":"/yrTujfazJzokubJk7jhMpXBjkpD.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Phil Jergins","credit_id":"52fe467fc3a368484e093d57","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay E.
