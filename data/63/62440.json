Their ancestors - European Jews - were forced to convert during the Spanish Inquisition. Isolated in Catholic countries, rejected by local Jewish communities, they battle to become Jews regardless of the consequences. The Longing, set in Ecuador, tells the story of their attempt to regain their birthright. On the Internet, they have found an American rabbi committed to helping \"lost Jews\" reclaim their identities. He meets them in Guayaquil, where he has difficulty getting the local Jewish community's support in facilitating their conversions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Connecting with ancestors, reclaiming faith.
