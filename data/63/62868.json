Having resolved to embrace the challenges of nature, he leaves his home in the city of Ayodhya. Neelkanth walks alone into the cold stormy night, wearing nothing over his shoulders or under his feet, carrying nothing - no maps, no money, no food - except inner courage, confidence and a silent spiritual strength. At the Saryu River, he enters the cold, raging current. Neelkanth is swept away, leaving behind all that was familiar.","popularity":0.1474,"poster_path":"/2n90FOntrCneInz5fH5RmWck4iE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109965,"logo_path":null,"name":"EUA, Infinity Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mystic India","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"India misteriosa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Índia Mística","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2147296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Latesh Patel","original_name":"Latesh Patel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mCWq4z0Nbvrx6uhVq7rCL8urKRp.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Neelkanth (11 anos)","credit_id":"5bbea2820e0a262359004cc4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter O'Toole","original_name":"Peter O'Toole","popularity":1.351,"profile_path":"/bk2AIN5yjqkthDUxUH0Q4U2ekRH.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Narrador","credit_id":"5bbea2c60e0a26249c001515","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2147299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rupak Mehta","original_name":"Rupak Mehta","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Neelkanth","credit_id":"5bbea312c3a36844fb001267","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Melton","original_name":"Keith Melton","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/gVnsIvVoGOXhgAYmOfeHcjIpmgV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4690c3a368484e097ac5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":38793,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mose Richards","original_name":"Mose Richards","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4690c3a368484e097acb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0400675","wikidata_id":"Q6948947","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2n90FOntrCneInz5fH5RmWck4iE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/mCWq4z0Nbvrx6uhVq7rCL8urKRp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hGGhVon5bIg9NlaBOcfrsgl9tAz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Neelkanth - Mystic India trailer","key":"UIyibcAxkRU","published_at":"2007-03-04T13:56:53.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6b9c3a3685448006559"}]}}}
