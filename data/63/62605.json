Feeding off the demon's pride, the symbiont stone slowly transforms Morg into an all-consuming beast with the power to threaten both Heaven and Earth. Facing impossible odds, it's up to Michael and the Guardian Force to prove the old Proverb true: that pride comes before the fall. Featuring the inventive action and effects that have made Angel Wars the top-selling inspirational action-adventure cartoon, Episode 3 explores the dangers of a prideful life.","popularity":0.8137,"poster_path":"/272ubWvvSo5qTEdJRfHpLixxhSf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Backyard Digital Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":26574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faith for Today","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angel Wars: Grace and Glory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Angel Wars: Guardian Force - Episode 3","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Billingslea","original_name":"Beau Billingslea","popularity":0.3915,"profile_path":"/tU2NJQ5m1sRlwpw9ljyt5NJB0Bf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Swift","credit_id":"57ce004ac3a36868d9007ae4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nanci Johnson","original_name":"Nanci Johnson","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kira","credit_id":"57ce0068c3a36867dd0023a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Moran","original_name":"Justin Moran","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Eli","credit_id":"57ce007b925141794c00778e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.J.
