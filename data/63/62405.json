He arrives on a burro, which doesn't get along at all well with her; she convinces him to buy a car. They head through the desert, but the car breaks down, and throws Donald out, then takes off on its own with Daisy trapped inside the rumble seat. The car hits a rock, throwing Daisy into a mud puddle, to Donald's excessive amusement. Daisy pulls a unicycle from her purse, and rides off.","popularity":0.6762,"poster_path":"/ipZj0bN6yqtIIWCIhhYNTpb1JFs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first official Donald Duck cartoon","title":"Don Donald","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":49,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Donald, der Caballero","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Don Paperino","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Nash","original_name":"Clarence Nash","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/x2g2hbu4RRIcn6Q5RT8gpWR1FKV.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Donald Duck / Donna Duck (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe467cc3a368484e09359b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11426,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ben Sharpsteen","original_name":"Ben Sharpsteen","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/nfruaWGIjvI99oXmyzmsnGkdDL9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe467cc3a368484e09354f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Merrill De Maris","original_name":"Merrill De Maris","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe467cc3a368484e09358b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2107,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul J.
