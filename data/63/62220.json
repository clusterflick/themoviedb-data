However, mention THE DA VINCI CODE today, just about anywhere, and you’ll find that everyone has heard of it and the majority have read it! This would be remarkable enough if THE DA VINCI CODE was purely a work of fiction, but the interwoven facts, that are indeed the backbone of the novel, put it in a class of its own. Yet the history, paintings and locations that inspired Dan Brown’s tale are equally as fascinating as the book itself, and this program has been devised to take you on an intriguing journey of discovery in search of the facts behind the fiction.","popularity":0.0656,"poster_path":"/pgdddoIXpsxnyJhYZW4A9gEuytO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Da Vinci Tracking the Code","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgdddoIXpsxnyJhYZW4A9gEuytO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
