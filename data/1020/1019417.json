Inspired by France's Grand Guignol style of horror theatre, and utilizing a lyrical language both visual and verbal to capture the strange poetry of the Mojave land and soundscape, Serpentine Pink follows a reclusive biker woman and her John Wayne-obsessed exotic dancer lover's disturbing fallout after a violent acid attack. An ethereal psychic and her aspiring healer companion converge with supernatural forces in an attempt to confront and then heal the women's - as well as their own - deep-rooted, personal pain that comes from trying to break the cycle of possessive love.","popularity":1.3564,"poster_path":"/vSihHZdrQ3wHKvMwC3qbgBOUiFg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hard Knock
