There were two hurdles to overcome in the realization of the ceremony: first, a group of Ainu had to be convinced, who were against a revival of the tradition. Secondly, there were only a few members of the community who knew the details of the ceremony at all, since most of them had already been celebrating a wedding in their own style for over 80 years.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6aWc7r33AX9m07fyanJH8pYLLBH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wedding Ceremony of the Ainus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3685245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayano Shigeru","original_name":"Kayano Shigeru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6311affabe55b7007bf332ff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1763730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Himeda Tadayoshi","original_name":"姫田忠義","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/em2qMgg9lPrsskHBiCy9T3nDA8o.jpg","credit_id":"6311ae037fcab3007a20c351","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241422,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shûkichi Koizumi","original_name":"Shûkichi Koizumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6311aeab7fcab3007fbe4115","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241422,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shûkichi Koizumi","original_name":"Shûkichi Koizumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6311aebebe55b7008d7f474f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6aWc7r33AX9m07fyanJH8pYLLBH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
