He can be considered as Latvian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or Václav Havel. Twenty years he spent in Soviet prisons because of anti-government thinking. In a 1983 trial by the Latvian SSR, Astra said, “I believe this time will fade like an evil nightmare.”  The fate of Gunārs Astra himself was tragic. Like Alexei Navalny in Russia, Astra was poisoned with tea on a train to Saint Petersburg. A week later, Gunārs Astra died. Astra’s death became a symbol of light on the long road to the restoration of Latvia’s independence.","popularity":0.2344,"poster_path":"/1N1iRuWkySrmWoaJvsH1de3wtyu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90476,"logo_path":null,"name":"SKUBA films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Astra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liene Laviņa-Kalnaella","original_name":"Liene Laviņa-Kalnaella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63111309126ec30092a0e0cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gundars Rēders","original_name":"Gundars Rēders","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63111324a2e602007d2bda99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandijs Semjonovs","original_name":"Sandijs Semjonovs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/tYZDVNEBVFlNH3oupB07CF6Qxvu.jpg","credit_id":"6311167ac048a9008fe8f9a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edmunds Jansons","original_name":"Edmunds Jansons","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/bGtoeKNNjvZt4SFNHj6TYfhFwma.jpg","credit_id":"631116b6c048a9008fe8f9ae","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297708,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandra Alksne","original_name":"Sandra Alksne","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640758323e2ec800a636bcbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raits Valters","original_name":"Raits Valters","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ef141bdd56802f0cbe03f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4037467,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jānis Šipkēvics","original_name":"Jānis Šipkēvics","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ef19f68188803057e5327","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","original_name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ef1f4c0a30802dd6fc328","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2231045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Pāss","original_name":"Pēteris Pāss","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ef21c23a31403027b43fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29517399","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1N1iRuWkySrmWoaJvsH1de3wtyu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmwh1aFEeu3f5VSMD40sp6oZfBy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Splendid Palace","release_date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ASTRA (2023) | trailer - ENG subs","key":"wR1Ewpfq2t0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-24T09:25:55.000Z","id":"65dccbef3dc8850168429a72"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gunārs Astra.
