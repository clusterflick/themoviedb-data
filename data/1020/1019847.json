Con bravura is about conspiracy conflating the paths of a rather unconventional nun and an intrigued young man – each of them bears secrets and the encounter could incite a flaming romance, though one suffocated by war.Munk set the film in the mountain capital of Zakopane and its vicinity, allowing breathtaking views from a cable car and using his experiences of the Nazi occupation in the area to add gritty reality. The director plays a cameo as a priest with several of his industry friends also making appearances.","popularity":0.1595,"poster_path":"/e8xgxTIPcV1CA0uwX4HxtDuXADI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe
