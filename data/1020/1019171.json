The tragic events of that day left four dead. Chicano Moratorium: A Question of Freedom is a harrowing, eyewitness documentary of the events of August 29, 1970 and their immediate aftermath, including the murder of Chicano journalist, Ruben Salazar. In contrast to biased TV news reports of the period, this student-made short offers an impassioned, unvarnished community account of the unrest and violence unleashed by the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department in response to the otherwise peaceful march in protest of disproportionate Chicano casualties in the Vietnam War.","popularity":0.4238,"poster_path":"/p8MSnYIt3nDWw71dw78DQA4ReiD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicano Moratorium: A Question of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Myrdahl","original_name":"Thomas Myrdahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcbf7abdec00082ec99a9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683812,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jose Rivera","original_name":"Jose Rivera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcbe8abdec0007d6efdc1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolai Sherbin","original_name":"Nikolai Sherbin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcba512425c009d7d5562","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683811,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carlos Chavez","original_name":"Carlos Chavez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcbcaf6fd18007aaf34f2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolai Sherbin","original_name":"Nikolai Sherbin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcb937fcab30091db54c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Myrdahl","original_name":"Thomas Myrdahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcb76e942ee007e9aff7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Myrdahl","original_name":"Thomas Myrdahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcc30c048a9008fe8a0d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683813,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Hunt","original_name":"John Hunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcc25f6fd18007aaf350d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Myrdahl","original_name":"Thomas Myrdahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630fcb80e942ee0092f9e1c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p8MSnYIt3nDWw71dw78DQA4ReiD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8XMlAGmWrt5WuLFDKYhd1TPkyzz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":181557,"name":"anti war protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
