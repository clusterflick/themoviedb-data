But crotchety old Farmer Al Falfa, who's sick with the flu, rejects the cure -- at first.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/yv25dH9ZuG9EB1SHkRdvQnNwqRJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aesop's Fables Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day by Day in Every Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0402955","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yv25dH9ZuG9EB1SHkRdvQnNwqRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1923-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
