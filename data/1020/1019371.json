He described this voyage in several papers. Many travellers to the Sierra Tarahumara followed his traces. After his return he was locked up in psychiatric clinics until shortly before his death. The film reconstructs authentically Artaud's route: from the dances behind the mission settlements to the Peyote rituals of the shaman. Behind the fear and fascination of the unknown Artaud senses another order. \"I shall find the real drama\" he writes. \"It need not be on the stage\".","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ritual der schwarzen Sonne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerd Roscher","original_name":"Gerd Roscher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6310be281511aa0080d75686","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1331269","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
