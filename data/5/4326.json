A lethargic sub-culture of students, artists, bohemians and barflys had flourished among crumbling buildings. Part of that microcosm is barkeeper Frank, semi-formally called 'Herr Lehmann' by friends and patrons. He hangs out drinking, sports utter disregard for anything beyond SO 36 and lazily pursues an affair with cook Katrin. His lifestyle is gradually disturbed, when his parents show up for a visit, things go awry with Katrin and his best friend Karl starts to act strange. Meanwhile, political turmoil mounts on the other side of the Wall.","popularity":0.9335,"poster_path":"/1jxhEu4H4dOMA5cLxRbGd7K5KUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230,"logo_path":"/yHUO3r7pjGTvtXLFb4zA66vC7cU.png","name":"Boje Buck Produktion
