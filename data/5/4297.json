Not only in France but all over the world, Truffaut's Hitchcock interview developed over the years into a standard bible of film literature. In 1983, three years after Hitchcock's death, Truffaut decided to expand his by now legendary book to include a concluding chapter and have it published as the \"Edition définitive\". This film describes the genesis of the \"Hitchbook\" and throws light on the strange friendship between two completely different men. The centrepieces are the extracts from the original sound recordings of the interview with the voices of Alfred Hitchcock, Francois Truffaut, and Helen Scott – recordings which have never been heard in public before.","popularity":0.4285,"poster_path":"/y4vF1vFBicCSX4qw9m6eQ6sB0Bj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monsieur Truffaut Meets Mr. Hitchcock","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Chabrol","original_name":"Claude Chabrol","popularity":0.3612,"profile_path":"/myzAC2aVHhqLxzb7Bqo7xVtOloG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Hitchcock","original_name":"Patricia Hitchcock","popularity":0.2584,"profile_path":"/bgMYy4SJLFcFex91an1D593pBY9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Morgenstern","original_name":"Madeleine Morgenstern","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad63","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Louis Richard","original_name":"Jean-Louis Richard","popularity":0.2226,"profile_path":"/pT0vIOIESVdy1AincoVJowRksRI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad67","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":18489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Truffaut","original_name":"Laura Truffaut","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad6b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Truffaut","original_name":"François Truffaut","popularity":0.9068,"profile_path":"/75zp0S5OTo8Y6nLOzherJ9s656A.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad6f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Hitchcock","original_name":"Alfred Hitchcock","popularity":1.3971,"profile_path":"/108fiNM6poRieMg7RIqLJRxdAwG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad73","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Scott","original_name":"Helen Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5544ea70c3a36856e50017e9","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fischer","original_name":"Robert Fischer","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36203,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simone Stewens","original_name":"Simone Stewens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43b9c3a36847f806ad57","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0298068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y4vF1vFBicCSX4qw9m6eQ6sB0Bj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
