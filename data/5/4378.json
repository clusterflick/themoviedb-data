This documentary examines the personality of the killer who died in 1976 during voluntary castration surgery at the age of 30. Vilified by the press for his heinous crime,  Bartsch also became a case study for famous found criminal psychologists like Alice Miller (who maintains that no one abuses without being abused as a child, and murderers tend to have their own childhood abuse denied by the adults around them). Bartsch never met his birth parents, he was raised in a clinic and later adopted by a cold, unaffectionate couple. By the age of 15, he tortured and killed his first child victim. This informative, fact-filled documentary provides enough details for viewers to come away with a broader understanding of the nature of the criminally insane and society's role in their formation.","popularity":0.1557,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obituary of a Beast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfried Rasch","original_name":"Wilfried Rasch","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c09d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Sch端bel","original_name":"Rolf Sch端bel","popularity":0.131,"profile_path":"/jB51wYRnRfrS0L86zbU0QXnGV2v.jpg","credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c06b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Lentz","original_name":"Michael Lentz","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c071","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Lentz","original_name":"Michael Lentz","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c077","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Sch端bel","original_name":"Rolf Sch端bel","popularity":0.131,"profile_path":"/jB51wYRnRfrS0L86zbU0QXnGV2v.jpg","credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c07d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36792,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jelka Naber","original_name":"Jelka Naber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c083","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ingeborg Janiczek","original_name":"Ingeborg Janiczek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c089","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Bolbrinker","original_name":"Niels Bolbrinker","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/k3QJKcgl4kHbRF58b0Kp0Sx8uXZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c08f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Harald Reetz","original_name":"Harald Reetz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43bdc3a36847f806c095","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0087773","wikidata_id":"Q105394095","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
