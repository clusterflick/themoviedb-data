Intending to remain at the Berghof for three weeks, Hans is gradually contaminated by the morbid atmosphere pervading the place. Wishing very much to be considered a patient like the others, he achieves his ends and stays in the sanatorium for ...seven years. During this time, he has enough time to take part in the furious philosophical debates pitting against each other Settembrini, a secular humanist, and Naphta, a totalitarian Jesuit. And to fall in love with the beautiful but enigmatic Clawdia Chauchat. When he is finally discharged in 1914 - along with all the other patients - it is only to plunge into the horrors of World War I.","popularity":0.9284,"poster_path":"/vvNfceXVqwCWhgj1DhNbdVcA6sS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opera Film Produzione","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Franz Seitz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iduna Film Produktiongesellschaft","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La montagne magique","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Eichhorn","original_name":"Christoph Eichhorn","popularity":0.2356,"profile_path":"/gNmRXmiKk79yssYGuy9B07dJkAb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hans Castorp","credit_id":"52fe43acc3a36847f8066e47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-France Pisier","original_name":"Marie-France Pisier","popularity":0.6251,"profile_path":"/l8umVAuHCPsJSFgHmP3nfCCrfwD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clawdia Chauchat","credit_id":"52fe43acc3a36847f8066e43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flavio Bucci","original_name":"Flavio Bucci","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":"/lZoYVFD8ebEwM2VQLeVDNg62SJu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ludovico Settembrini","credit_id":"52fe43acc3a36847f8066e4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Aznavour","original_name":"Charles Aznavour","popularity":0.5153,"profile_path":"/yC3yv9Z8J8v4UteLFiDIx97fKYx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Naphta","credit_id":"52fe43acc3a36847f8066e4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Steiger","original_name":"Rod Steiger","popularity":0.9423,"profile_path":"/brIyEn13q7IQr0MoNcU529roNbr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mynher Peperkorn","credit_id":"52fe43acc3a36847f8066e3f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Christian Blech","original_name":"Hans Christian Blech","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/j7UNNNlIX8mr9M6c6c1PE39NNQv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hofrat Behrens","credit_id":"52fe43acc3a36847f8066e53","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Radszun","original_name":"Alexander Radszun","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Joachim Ziemßen","credit_id":"52fe43adc3a36847f8066e57","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Hielscher","original_name":"Margot Hielscher","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/58IiXcZVw9tk6prJXQTS4OdlmZQ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Frau Stöhr","credit_id":"52fe43adc3a36847f8066e5b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gudrun Gabriel","original_name":"Gudrun Gabriel","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":"/woX8zPlxdtPXxXMv71VaeFbLHUB.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Frl.
