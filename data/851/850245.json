She is clearly not comfortable, looking a little paranoid as she glances around her as if checking that there's no one laying in wait around the next corner. She's easy to startle, flinching as a car drives by in the background. She lets out a shuddery breath to calm herself, then hugs herself, trying to provide the comfort she's been deprived of for so many days.  As Kylie (Maya Kendrick) paces, she experiences jarring flashbacks to an event that is clearly traumatic for her. Between the flashes, Kylie looks more and more upset, holding her head and cursing to herself. She keeps looking at something in her hand. Her world is clearly falling apart. She finally brings the phone to her ear, making a phone call. \"Something happened. W-we need to talk,\" Kylie says, anguished.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4bj4Qs7oDi3SHhMWsYpi557OE0K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/p4SuncmnR1bxoA6GNVEA4tQIn4y.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You're Safe Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1842045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Wright","original_name":"Whitney Wright","popularity":21.609,"profile_path":"/rrpgHJnZ1L3QWFlPSbrpJDXR3YZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60ed63f8140bad007ea43bd5","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1808389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Kendrick","original_name":"Maya Kendrick","popularity":4.146,"profile_path":"/5dd1tiEqEWJcglvT59yNH8A1ORq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60ed64006dc50700493da091","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":123139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derrick Pierce","original_name":"Derrick Pierce","popularity":4.974,"profile_path":"/d4BUS7c1ztnAES5OoF0y3UtgtXK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60ed6408b7abb50047a6aaaf","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1909553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Bronson","original_name":"Nathan Bronson","popularity":6.749,"profile_path":"/wWbUiHSgvZ9J3nZBdWwjxD3TXSy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60ed640f397df0007e265f60","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":42259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Masterson","original_name":"Eric Masterson","popularity":14.048,"profile_path":"/9gej1Owbbt5YQWjiUYsFXvjphD1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60ed6416140bad005d33c77f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1731005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craven Moorehead","original_name":"Craven Moorehead","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":"/q7qf2299QpDYYOA5Jwbk5RaNIbH.jpg","credit_id":"60ed63e9dcf875005fee03ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4bj4Qs7oDi3SHhMWsYpi557OE0K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
