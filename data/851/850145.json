Tens of thousands of lives were ruined. Today, nature has begun reclaiming the area of the exclusion zone surrounding the old power plant. But the consequences and the suffering are still felt today. Chernobyl is a lesson for the present. It warns us about the risks of our ever-evolving modern society. But Chernobyl taught us more importantly about the cost of lies. By highlighting the flaws in the Soviet Union system, it revealed how they can lead to disaster, and how the way we tell information about what really happened can cause harm. The past cannot be undone, but we can learn from it.","popularity":0.1399,"poster_path":"/ixcZCaq7VMTYIBNUiZSEJHulVnI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chernobyl: The Invisible Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3041535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxane Schlumberger","original_name":"Roxane Schlumberger","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ccd51a806730122e82484","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14637914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/88NqBMaGbxolr8wM08EzBC1godA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ixcZCaq7VMTYIBNUiZSEJHulVnI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1929,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nGeoeJUthcpUHxPqzb7bed4vHlQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1356}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
