The hotel founded in 1899 helped the region to prosper and later Hitler to come to power. From 1929 the hotel supported the NSDAP and even after it was closed down in 1945 it was used as a hiding place for persecuted facists. The filmmaker Cuini Amelio-Ortiz born in La Falda and now living in Germany tells the story of the hotel in a fictional and documentarian style, moving somewhere between legend and reality; Showing that German history left its traces in South America and how the fate of the inhabitans of La Falda is knitted together to Hitler Germany.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","original_name":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee2afca44d09005ecfaaea","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","original_name":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee2aeb6dc507005fc49e01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","original_name":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee2b11706e56002edea419","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3157020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hector Navarrete","original_name":"Hector Navarrete","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee2b295f622b002fe39287","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2034688,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergio Gazzera","original_name":"Sergio Gazzera","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee2b47ab1bc7007413efa1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
