The camera follows to Leicester, where a young man is late for a job interview thanks to a variety of incidents including a freight train blocking the line and an improperly secured door at Derby. The film is a modernised version of an older theme for British Transport 'Right Time Means Right Time', where the accumulation of many minor delays on the part of BR staff soon add up down the line to make a train very late.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/oKeLJ0BhTQE9I7Ni7ITitDby0Si.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52835,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Transport Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Promises Promises...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ritchie","original_name":"James Ritchie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60eeb88c0f0da50048823428","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2683797,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maurice Picot","original_name":"Maurice Picot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60eeb8a46dc507002e06ef69","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3157447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Tambling","original_name":"Richard Tambling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60eeb87cdcf875008033a61c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3157447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Tambling","original_name":"Richard Tambling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60eeb881cf1afd007533d99d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3157449,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Black","original_name":"Stuart Black","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60eeb8c50f21c6005f5300b2","department":"Production","job":"Unit Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951390,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John W.
