Those Left Waiting is a collaborative documentary that allows refugees in camps spread throughout distant corners of the world – from Africa and the Middle East to Asia and Europe – to take control of how their stories are told. Featuring footage of both the hardships and happiness in their daily lives, shot and streamed in real time, this one-of-a-kind project is as insightfully exploratory as it is expansive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Left Waiting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14485006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
