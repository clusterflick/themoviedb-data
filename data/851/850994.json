He places bets with his friend Charlie, but Charlie has become disappointed with Max's lack of control. Max starts to beg family and friends for large sums of money, but no one's willing to help. Even his successful older brother has doubts about why he needs the money. His younger brother Kyle might be his only hope, but he's in a little bit of trouble pocketing money from his \"side\" gig. With bank letters threatening to take his house, he becomes more desperate for quick money. He thinks all he needs is just one more sure bet to keep him above water, but luck plays a wicked game.","popularity":0.7122,"poster_path":"/iVvLYqzJouQI1UqtQFKUalxEQza.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-11","revenue":2000,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Luck plays a wicked game.","title":"The Debt Of Maximillian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1947742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Lee Eller","original_name":"Travis Lee Eller","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/3dIb80444buuj4Vb1lknQPLLeWK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maximillian","credit_id":"60f5eb1ce72fe8002f8a3acb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2278192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Valeriano","original_name":"Mark Valeriano","popularity":0.1554,"profile_path":"/bf2Iy1mSFFAEjwpdcMH58A22OII.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"60f5eb3112c604004670a9ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelica Briones","original_name":"Angelica Briones","popularity":0.0736,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nena","credit_id":"60f5eb7cad87f7005c23d2aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3164029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Prendergast","original_name":"Kate Prendergast","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Heather","credit_id":"60f5ebb9c439c00072824ed7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Pilkington","original_name":"Marie Pilkington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"60f5ebe3d7cd0600459b2d8c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikiko Flynn","original_name":"Mikiko Flynn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Chloe","credit_id":"60f5ebf942d8a50045fdf6fc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wali Habib","original_name":"Wali Habib","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"60f5ec2d8258fc002d8f3e40","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2927619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Elden","original_name":"James Elden","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Addicted Man","credit_id":"60f5ec88d7cd06005d7a4628","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Pablo Castañeda","original_name":"Juan Pablo Castaneda","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/vQ4X2Yba50ATIhq4ZWkeZeBovk7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dealer","credit_id":"60f5ec9f7b7b4d007355a500","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Canyon Heston","original_name":"Canyon Heston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Akron","credit_id":"60f5ecb453866e00466821ed","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2008605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maddison Bullock","original_name":"Maddison Bullock","popularity":0.2596,"profile_path":"/uS380VZ0UVNEg7Ig3OsNowb7wCB.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bank Employee","credit_id":"60f5ecdd7b7b4d0020ec1c47","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Maniraho","original_name":"Jonathan Maniraho","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Waren","credit_id":"60f5ed0f12c604007447665a","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2846608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Kurushima","original_name":"Kyle Kurushima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Worker 2","credit_id":"60f5ed40af58cb0046cd2f03","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaeme Velez","original_name":"Jaeme Velez","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Gunman 1","credit_id":"60f5ed628258fc007396b4a0","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah F.
