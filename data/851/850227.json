A revealing, deeply personal account of artist Jocelyn Tribeâ€™s life, Poleng utilises contemporary movement, Balinese dance, and archival and family photographs to delve into the complicated tangle of mixed-race identity, growing up with an absent parent and intergenerational relationships. Layered, luminous and presented with at times excruciating honesty, this dance documentary duets presence with absence in chronicling a life only half-understood.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poleng","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desak Putu Warti","original_name":"Desak Putu Warti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"611095c101e4d1002ec90f5c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jocelyn Tribe","original_name":"Jocelyn Tribe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"611095c58c44b9002fe6613e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naina Sen","original_name":"Naina Sen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611095930c271000808572f6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naina Sen","original_name":"Naina Sen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6110958e426ae8004605c50b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naina Sen","original_name":"Naina Sen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6110958a223e200045f8fdc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naina Sen","original_name":"Naina Sen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61109598387651002b20ce80","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
