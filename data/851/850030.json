The grammar of No Common Sentence is defiant, it is slow, it is repetitive, it is messy, and it ruptures conventions within cinematic language as it also retreats into a rhythmic tide pool of imagelessness.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fnqeMABfA8VfsgSzkNhfrdGZzRz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Common Sentence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orla Mc Hardy","original_name":"Orla Mc Hardy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ec974353f83300749b3c56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1619,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fnqeMABfA8VfsgSzkNhfrdGZzRz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Huner Francis/ Missing Observer Studies","release_date":"2020-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
