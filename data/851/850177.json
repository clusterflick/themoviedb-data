Their intimately-made film This is a stained glass window (2019) draws on conceptual art and performance documentation to self-reflexively survey their then-15-year collaborative relationship, inspired by a description of the friendship between Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy as a “thinking business for and with each other”. Within the work, they explore topics such as labour and support, from a unique and multilayered perspective.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is A Stained Glass Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
