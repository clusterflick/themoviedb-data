Jung An Tagens frighteningly frenetic and earsplitting dissonance is complimented perfectly by Rainer Kohlbergers constantly evolving, neon-tinged visual freak-out. The result is relentless and painfully overwhelming, but like a horror movie, Emergence Collapse demands – and ultimately rewards – your attention.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":"/2qdWPnKPS0dVJ9EP4xQS5vo3KO5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emergence Collapse","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Kohlberger","original_name":"Rainer Kohlberger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/jjWzhTAlXBjaNPkFJiL7JnklBAp.jpg","credit_id":"60efba176dc507008162fd16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jung an Tagen","original_name":"Jung an Tagen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60efba51ab1bc70047bb9690","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1zknxHcH7QDh2I1Rb9KbxTIdGg3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1003,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2qdWPnKPS0dVJ9EP4xQS5vo3KO5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":751}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3307,"name":"surreal"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rainer Kohlberger & Jung An Tagen - Emergence Collapse","key":"N51g2nZ31Ec","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-14T11:00:07.000Z","id":"6114e884006b01002f1d0a09"}]}}}
