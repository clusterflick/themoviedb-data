Eye-catching, almost otherworldy and unashamedly provocative, this commentary on class, sexuality and urban stratification appropriates the pathologising label of ‘Other’ to shine a light on the explosion of ‘lifeforms’ in the Spanish capital today. Featuring the clever use of 8mm to create a surreal, pseudo-documentary look that draws in and distances simultaneously, Madrid, Bad Life is a sophisticated and thought-provoking high-concept work.","popularity":0.1233,"poster_path":"/y07JZSsvW3VPENhmdbyr8H4bLuA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madrid, Bad Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Ruiz","original_name":"Ignacio Ruiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vrF9siacZXh0yBQEsAYGpq9qZdT.jpg","credit_id":"6110a09e01e4d10075436187","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2863755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabela Bianchi","original_name":"Isabela Bianchi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hhuVwYZUSBiHYJnXH3nLWgQIqHo.jpg","credit_id":"6110a0a801e4d1005e8ed428","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Adiego Almudevar","original_name":"Pablo Adiego Almudevar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6110a0c938765100604b611d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Gómez García","original_name":"María Gómez García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6110a0c2e63571008083c874","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18082230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y07JZSsvW3VPENhmdbyr8H4bLuA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":693}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
