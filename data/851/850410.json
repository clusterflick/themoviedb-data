It is a symbol of North America, of progress, and of nostalgia.  Reporter Stud Terkel travelled 2,000 miles across the United States by Greyhound. From Seattle to Chicago, he observes his fellow-passengers. He meets a number of travelers who appear to be very interesting people: a Native American boxer on his way to his birthplace in Montana, a bar owner who was a bank robber in a former 'career', a 99 year old woman who is still running a busy hotel, and, of course, a pedigree cowboy.  The spectator of this film listens to their personal stories, watches the beautiful scenery, and is treated to famous feature film fragments in which the Greyhound bus plays a part. Seven states and two time zones later, he is back in his cinema seat.","popularity":0.0863,"poster_path":"/kUeqTtYym7hKrmAF2jisdauEZXU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westbourne Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ridin' the Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Studs Terkel","original_name":"Studs Terkel","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/weQxTiTG49Zejd3UHjocrVtyRxk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60edffb9a44d09004664e750","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3156789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carina Cooper","original_name":"Carina Cooper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60edff8511386c007571492e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3156791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Kane","original_name":"Susan Kane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60edfffeb7abb5002a0ec3e3","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Purdie","original_name":"John Purdie","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee00c30f0da5004880e0e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3156790,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rod Kitchen","original_name":"Rod Kitchen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60edffeb0f0da5005fd35fa9","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146755,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aad Wirtz","original_name":"Aad Wirtz","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee0077b7abb5005e022b9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":473,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brian Tufano","original_name":"Brian Tufano","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee00b4abf8e200467ca163","department":"Crew","job":"Lighting Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":959072,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rene Haynes","original_name":"Rene Haynes","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee00158c3159007d8d65a6","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3156794,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Chilvers","original_name":"Keith Chilvers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee0039397df000462e5f53","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274057,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mike Lax","original_name":"Mike Lax","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee004bab1bc7005e37076e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927883,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Shepard","original_name":"Paul Shepard","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee00909369a2002a924ace","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1971004,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Barker","original_name":"Alan Barker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ee0068706e560045c248ca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kUeqTtYym7hKrmAF2jisdauEZXU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Ridin' the Dog\"   1989 Greyhound Buses Documentary","key":"BaaaqJm4xJM","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-12-22T11:45:22.000Z","id":"60edff269369a200743d9be7"}]}}}
