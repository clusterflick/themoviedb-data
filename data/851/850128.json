Boggs, the U.S. Department of State’s official geographer (1927-1954). Graphic artist Boris Artzybasheff was allegedly recruited as a consultant for the effort, according to Timothy Barney, Mapping the Cold War: Cartography and the Framing of America’s International Power, 2015. Unfortunately, the creative ideas Boggs described below - using aliens and spaceships - never made it into the movie. Instead, the movie is a relatively straight-forward animated map movie with a theme of growing globalization.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/9k1271MRkfURO3fpIgoIw8wiWkO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157208,"logo_path":null,"name":"United States Government","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expanding World Relationships","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Hilberman","original_name":"David Hilberman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecf1eb140bad005d3309d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1543210","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9k1271MRkfURO3fpIgoIw8wiWkO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
