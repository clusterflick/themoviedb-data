Revised and set to music by Paul Görnert,\" is how the film describes its theme in the opening credits: as in the famous film by the Lumière brothers, people stream out of the factory gate. The footage from 1953 shows Tower Block I, in front of which buses are waiting to take the workers home. The older images taken by Oskar Barnack in \"Workers leaving the Leitz factory\" were probably taken in 1915 in front of the gate of the old optics building.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wenn die Glocke ertönt - Eine Fabriktor-Studie von Oskar Barnack","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5830374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Görnert","original_name":"Paul Görnert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692054062041a7d4ce4a30f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
