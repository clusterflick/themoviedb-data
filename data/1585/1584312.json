The man begins to iron the blanket. Shortly afterwards, a woman in a yellow sweater stands there and begins to iron the same blanket. Together they take turns ironing. But despite their efforts, the blanket remains wrinkled, because the creases they are trying to smooth out are the very ones they themselves are causing. What begins as a joint activity soon escalates into a conflict. Conceived as a loop, the film deals with themes such as control, naivety, and the bittersweet hope for renewal, inviting viewers to find parts of themselves in the simplicity of everyday objects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Iron Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5828438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruta Vasiliauskaite","original_name":"Ruta Vasiliauskaite","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691ef504aaba19850e05852d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
