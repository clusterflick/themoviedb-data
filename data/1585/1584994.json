Behind the rhyme there are original Christian messages, but, as these messages are not explicit, leaving a gap between the messages and the rhyme. The gap allows a variety of interpretations and visual images of the rhyme, which are explored in this documentary by an Indian resident, a Taichi teacher, botanists, an artist, and bell ringers. The rhyme may be seen as the symbol of inclusive and diverse Glasgow.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE BIRD, THE TREE, THE BELL AND THE FISH OF GLASGOW","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
