From workplace microaggressions to housing discrimination, her daily struggles are interwoven with poetic sequences where traditional garments, textures, and memories become tools of resistance and an escape. As fashion transforms into a language of identity and protest, the film explores how origin defines worth - not only for fashion items, but for people as well.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/dNssxTEMKw2kfhZEZh6MqiMWcSx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Uzbek","iso_639_1":"uz","name":"ozbek"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MADE IN X","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4522236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ava Merson-O'Brien","original_name":"Ava Merson-O'Brien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ava","credit_id":"692061bf65fbc1253fc2d392","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2766053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Shoubber","original_name":"Sam Shoubber","popularity":0.2457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69206212910795ad2b058ac6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5830477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronika Kulisheva","original_name":"Veronika Kulisheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6920624036273465f24a313e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5830478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Porter","original_name":"Ben Porter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"692062528f5de963ba2e31d7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5830479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Ivanova-Kozhevnikova","original_name":"Sofia Ivanova-Kozhevnikova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920631a1700b33bc3fa2ff6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dNssxTEMKw2kfhZEZh6MqiMWcSx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
