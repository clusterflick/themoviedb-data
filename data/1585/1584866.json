This new staging of Jean-Philippe Rameau’s Baroque masterpiece is colourful, eccentric, full of wit and free of taboos, yet also surprisingly deep.\r Louis XV had Platée performed for his son's wedding festivities in 1745.

In 1749, the Paris opera added Platée to its repertoire, notwithstanding the outrage sparked by the libretto.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean-Philippe Rameau: Platée Czech National Theatre, Prague","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
