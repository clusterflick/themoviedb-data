Barnack filmed the spa gardens and the buildings on the left bank of the Lahn with the water tower and the legendary Hotel Balmoral, where Richard Wagner, among others, stayed. The Kaiser Bridge can be seen in the background, and the spa house on the right. Spa guests drink from the springs. The film was probably shot before the outbreak of World War I (August 1914), most likely in the early summer of 1914. There is also a photograph of the filming with the original Leica: it shows Barnack with his film camera on a hill above Bad Ems.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1914-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lahntal, Bad Ems","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5830366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Barnack","original_name":"Oskar Barnack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69205f990423198c74fa3198","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
