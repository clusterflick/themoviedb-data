A benign little creature, Buster morphs into a nightmarish beast to mete out vengeance to Eugene's enemies. His victims are the only ones besides Eugene who can see Buster, the creature becoming visible at the time of their deaths. The exception is Aloysius Murphy, whose rare brain disorder allows him to see Buster as well. Eugene learns of this and decides Murphy needs to be wiped off the face of the Earth. He tracks him down but learns too late just how uncontrollable Buster really is.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2bRAaSbUU5FlENBgh9zn26LVakw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polonia Brothers Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolie Canales","original_name":"Yolie Canales","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Judge Ellingham","credit_id":"691e5be1b860710ad8fa2839","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5827597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Sterling Chan","original_name":"Brian Sterling Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"ER Doctor","credit_id":"691e5c385cbec5bcc2c2cb91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5827637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Garrison","original_name":"Rob Garrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eugene","credit_id":"691e60242d4268c8e7c2cb78","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2125994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Hatch","original_name":"Tim Hatch","popularity":0.1946,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"EMT","credit_id":"691e6039a0f5efe42b2e2852","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1506464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Kirkendall","original_name":"Jeff Kirkendall","popularity":0.6365,"profile_path":"/7KZEjoDa9tlH3NiRPvoupwGUXV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"EMT","credit_id":"691e6044fa4775837505826a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Himmelberger","original_name":"Natalie Himmelberger","popularity":0.1594,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Hollander","credit_id":"691e605c37e91ebd9f21a314","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Titus Himmelberger","original_name":"Titus Himmelberger","popularity":0.2629,"profile_path":"/49SjwFawOCkbMXVVlIeCxWG4iKJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Murphy","credit_id":"691e6076a51566d4b6c2cb8f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Van Sant","original_name":"Ken Van Sant","popularity":1.0088,"profile_path":"/btaWmXWtYdcbiajHqKpzERkad9n.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dempsey","credit_id":"691e6087f1ccd57d674a283c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Piper","original_name":"Brett Piper","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/t5TFv4QuoahwG8KGjtWjVQR8xnc.jpg","credit_id":"691e609b552287864ac2cb33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Piper","original_name":"Brett Piper","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/t5TFv4QuoahwG8KGjtWjVQR8xnc.jpg","credit_id":"691e60a935e81483aefa2860","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Piper","original_name":"Brett Piper","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/t5TFv4QuoahwG8KGjtWjVQR8xnc.jpg","credit_id":"691e60c15e3e862606eb649f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593057,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anthony Polonia","original_name":"Anthony Polonia","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e60d5f5d7da36d8adb9a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Piper","original_name":"Brett Piper","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/t5TFv4QuoahwG8KGjtWjVQR8xnc.jpg","credit_id":"691e60ef3c7a51189feb6513","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Polonia","original_name":"Mark Polonia","popularity":0.4174,"profile_path":"/jvMznGqvfSCeQ45aGAhb2KZ8cCP.jpg","credit_id":"691e610017c4c5b81feb648d","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35093852","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2bRAaSbUU5FlENBgh9zn26LVakw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Physical","release_date":"2025-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
