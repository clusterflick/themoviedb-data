Based on a play by Kathy Acker, this thirty minute film is an experiment in translation, not only between mediums and formats but between decades and bodies. Iit can be seen as a continuation or exacerbation of a literary gesture initiated by Acker, who set a drama about the French Revolution in early 1980s New York City, transposing this historical content into the language and bodies of downtown punks, drug addicts and sex workers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Implosion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2510394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
