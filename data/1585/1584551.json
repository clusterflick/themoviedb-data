Also characteristic of his work, the scene takes place in front of a mirror, suggesting the kind of personal self-reflection that one is capable of – both good and evil. The video makes clear cinematographic reference to the ‘alter-ego’ transformation in Mamoulian’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and to the “You looking at me?” sequence performed in front of a mirror by Robert De Niro in Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, which also inspired Gordon’s Through a Looking Glass (1999).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rwxDj0lOBa5AkZCdxI7ViKB13lF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Making of Monster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Gordon","original_name":"Douglas Gordon","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691f4d63f1f72334af2e2c0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rwxDj0lOBa5AkZCdxI7ViKB13lF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
