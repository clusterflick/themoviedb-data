Among those present are participants in the '27th Wetzlar Association Shooting Competition'. The parade consists of festively decorated cars and horse-drawn carriages and wagons. The roadside is lined with spectators. Also visible are a brass band, participants in costumes, and decorated floats on which historical scenes are reenacted (knights, castles, soldiers). Women and men in 18th-century costumes and wigs sit on the float of the hairdressers' guild. Children and men ride bicycles. Another association has decorated its float as a Viking ship, and the people on it are dressed in appropriate costumes. Various groups of pedestrians and horsemen follow. At the end of the parade, more and more spectators join in. This is followed by scenes from downtown Wetzlar.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1914-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schützenfest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5830366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Barnack","original_name":"Oskar Barnack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692054b6367345d62421ac2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
