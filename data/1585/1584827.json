Now, in his later years, he lives in a care home, having spent the last three years battling Ataxia. Smoking remains one of the few pleasures he still has. “If I didn’t smoke, I wouldn’t even have a reason to get out of bed,” he says. Reaching the designated smoking area is a major effort — it takes him about 20 minutes to shuffle down the corridor with five-centimeter steps, turning corners, and taking breaks. But once there, under the sky, Mart shares his story with biting humor and sharp wit. His greatest wish? To visit Valli Bar one last time — the place where he once met the love of his life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 000 sammu suitsunurka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
