The camera refuses to manipulate, but is rather an interested spectator. The plot unfolds organically (rather than mechanically) as the actors (through the vehicle of skeletal storyline and spirited, and inspired, improvisation) begin to absorb the feelings and traits of the characters they are portraying. An experiment within the narrative tradition, and a critique and extension of the possibilities within that form. Inspired by the early narrative films of Andy Warhol.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As The Wheel Turns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wallin","original_name":"Michael Wallin","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691f9bd19d79a5e8d74a2c04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
