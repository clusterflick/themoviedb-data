After nearly 16 hours climbing in the high altitude “death zone” (above 8,000m where oxygen levels are dangerously low), Bargiel clipped into his skis on the summit of the tallest mountain on earth and started his descent via the South Col Route. He reached Camp II that night and rested - the summit ridge and Hillary Step had taken longer than planned, meaning darkness made it dangerous and difficult to navigate further that day. The next morning, he skied through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall - guided by a drone flown by his brother, Bartek - before safely arriving at Base Camp to become the first person to ascend and descend Mount Everest on skis with no supplementary oxygen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3TRetPKz1Vkt71JnM966QnNyAb5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235896,"logo_path":"/8GmWQ3lXf5DxDFI3wEA1nVFKZ9E.png","name":"Red Bull Media House","origin_country":"US"},{"id":126224,"logo_path":"/xDMxcUPPExxNgJ4OY1UfyYLxexx.png","name":"Red Bull TV","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Skied Down Mount Everest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
