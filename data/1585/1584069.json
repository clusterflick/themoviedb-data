The entire community has a population of only 400. Actor/musician Greg King takes us on tour of his family homes, and to meet his father and sister, who work at the hospital where they were all born. They tell of the importance of family and the irony of feeling worldly while connected to a small community in central Newfoundland.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":222304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Connections Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People Who Stay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4364197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg King","original_name":"Greg King","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"691e44e20b51f4c189798a81","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4276554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rhonda Buckley","original_name":"Rhonda Buckley","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e451591b82d0636cf7511","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4276554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rhonda Buckley","original_name":"Rhonda Buckley","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e451a91b82d0636cf7514","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292341,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Darcy Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Darcy Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e4527fff9afeb97798a0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827616,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lori Clarke","original_name":"Lori Clarke","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e4530a9474d545db502a8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69362,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bart Simpson","original_name":"Bart Simpson","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e4536fff9afeb97798a18","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827616,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lori Clarke","original_name":"Lori Clarke","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e453f95ca4fa087c6fc5b","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397803,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Cook","original_name":"Steve Cook","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e4547b3aae3c887cf74ab","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3748540,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jamie Lewis","original_name":"Jamie Lewis","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691e454e843e2bd80f798a44","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37616867","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":6178,"name":"newfoundland and labrador"},{"id":303303,"name":"newfoundland"},{"id":344495,"name":"labrador"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
