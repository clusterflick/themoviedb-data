The band was formed by Kristoffer “Garm” Rygg in 1993, and their current members are Rygg (vocal,  programming), Jørn H. Sværen (misc.) and Tore Ylwizaker (programming, piano). Since their first folk  metal/black metal release in 1993, Ulver’s style has ever been changing by combining elements of  experimental, electronic and ambient music, avant-garde, rock, trip-hop, and their own genre-defying  innovations.
