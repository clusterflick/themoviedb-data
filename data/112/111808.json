They won the National League wild card--then became the first wild card team to reach the World Series by sweeping the Giants and shocking the Braves.  The Cleveland Indians were a far different team than the one that battled in the 1995 World Series. This year, nobody expected them to beat the Yankees or the Orioles--but somehow they did.  And so, these two underdog warriors slugged it out in the heat and snow of the World Series until they reached that quintessential moment--Game Seven. Even then, it went on--into the 11th inning--the second longest Game Seven in history--before Edgar Renteria sent all of Florida into a state of delirious celebration.","popularity":0.3971,"poster_path":"/pw9FrhKveSv6oVRGJjmpnYNbFgU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1997 Florida Marlins: The Official World Series Film","video":true,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0331812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pw9FrhKveSv6oVRGJjmpnYNbFgU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n7uM6CixQ3pymlJwyxq85WAF1mj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.645,"height":1163,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gPx51f4XoLOTCtbFJjOh9ipPN1m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":416,"name":"miami, florida"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":189924,"name":"world series"},{"id":267788,"name":"major league baseball (mlb)"},{"id":289743,"name":"florida marlins"},{"id":289744,"name":"cleveland indians"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
