The next day, soldiers from both sides arrange a truce for  fishing trouts and exchange cans and cigarettes.

While the position is strengthened, a soldier escapes to the nearby village to see his family.","popularity":0.4369,"poster_path":"/62zDe9WefrKb7oBe083xWv0S8N5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Destello Films
