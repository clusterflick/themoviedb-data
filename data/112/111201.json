Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.","popularity":0.3456,"poster_path":"/swx1aIxm8qFqu67amC6tJPmduvL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravity","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Nankin","original_name":"Michael Nankin","popularity":0.26,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af3c3a36847f81ea1c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Wechter","original_name":"David Wechter","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":"/6EQbn9ZfCuOK3V8PAFkJtauQ0fG.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4af3c3a36847f81ea1cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0156579","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/swx1aIxm8qFqu67amC6tJPmduvL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
