After two Audi R18 TDI cars have retired following spectacular accidents, the remaining Audi fights a dramatic battle for overall victory with the three Peugeot 908 cars which the Audi trio ultimately decides in its favor with a narrow margin of 13 seconds. The film captures the entire drama of the fourth-narrowest running of the Le Mans 24 Hours with intimate insights into the team of Audi Sport and breath-taking pictures.","popularity":0.7889,"poster_path":"/7sycIw5sg6zqHzdI8DColwDjTdI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intersport Television","origin_country":""},{"id":3232,"logo_path":"/8KtxMsWLOK6zDTNAfi75yg2QvSt.png","name":"NFL Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Truth In 24 II: Every Second Counts","video":false,"vote_average":7.25,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Statham","original_name":"Jason Statham","popularity":28.102,"profile_path":"/whNwkEQYWLFJA8ij0WyOOAD5xhQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6609d0321f98d1017cb2ecdf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1051713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Gehring","original_name":"Rob Gehring","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af3c3a36847f81ea167","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2200022","wikidata_id":"Q62018341","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xO21Nwgzu3ssa9L5zhTWCxGcSE9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7sycIw5sg6zqHzdI8DColwDjTdI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9571,"name":"motor sport"},{"id":11695,"name":"automobile"},{"id":10037,"name":"le mans"},{"id":10038,"name":"audi"},{"id":10039,"name":"racing"},{"id":171778,"name":"le sarthe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Los Angeles, California","release_date":"2012-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
