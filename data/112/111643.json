Best known for his performance as Father Karras in The Exorcist, Miller experienced a brief but brilliant period of national acclaim, then curiously abandoned Hollywood to return to his hometown. After Miller died in a local bar Scranton, at the age of 62, filmmaker and fellow Scranton native Rebecca Marshall Ferris set out with her camera to find out why did this exceptional playwright, who achieved such phenomenal early success, never write a Broadway play again? And what happened to Miller in Hollywood that would make him run away from a promising acting career?","popularity":2.544,"poster_path":"/8hMSfZAql1hBBQpwoOq15T5sIlS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's difficult getting to the top; it's more difficult staying there.","title":"Miller's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Dern","original_name":"Bruce Dern","popularity":1.7354,"profile_path":"/24aH1ahmFFImPiBA5N4NhemshH9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec743","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Friedkin","original_name":"William Friedkin","popularity":0.7283,"profile_path":"/jKPmxwyEeGUCIQUiisXJcxtm9Hs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec747","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacy Keach","original_name":"Stacy Keach","popularity":1.6615,"profile_path":"/pxD1jmx9oAaV2lCLr87G3zRGv6i.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec74b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheen","original_name":"Martin Sheen","popularity":1.2177,"profile_path":"/m2Y3Q0uyuW6htrn2W9UWCWMkpZu.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec74f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sorvino","original_name":"Paul Sorvino","popularity":1.2158,"profile_path":"/1gF0UskusEdDcNaBDJ2CMsz5Agi.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec753","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Miller","original_name":"Jason Miller","popularity":0.4626,"profile_path":"/vdlYQsOOE3RRPi8p1yWNphqk9aM.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec757","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Marshall","original_name":"Rebecca Marshall","popularity":0.3647,"profile_path":"/pyETOvmKhs9BUkBXjOYdTeBq6a6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec71b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052621,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Ferris","original_name":"Jason Ferris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec721","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052643,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeremy Fleishman","original_name":"Jeremy Fleishman","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec73f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053124,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Mayne","original_name":"Paul Mayne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec793","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Marshall","original_name":"Rebecca Marshall","popularity":0.3647,"profile_path":"/pyETOvmKhs9BUkBXjOYdTeBq6a6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Marshall","original_name":"Rebecca Marshall","popularity":0.3647,"profile_path":"/pyETOvmKhs9BUkBXjOYdTeBq6a6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec75d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephen Scalese","original_name":"Stephen Scalese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4afec3a36847f81ec763","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053119,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas M.
