Four generations of men are featured in the film.  Father to Son deals with the conflict between generations and their subjective memories, and the way different methods of raising children pass from one generation to the next. How often and to what extent do we repeat the behavioural patterns of our fathers; can we change or break these patterns or is repeating them inescapable, and how many generations are needed for change to occur? Are the values we have inherited from our fathers still valid in the modern world? One of the leading themes of this film is the sensitivity of a man and a boy, and its preservation and suppression.","popularity":0.3405,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guerilla Films Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father to Son","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timo Koiso-Kanttila","original_name":"Timo Koiso-Kanttila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed557","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","original_name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed55b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaro Koiso-Kanttila","original_name":"Aaro Koiso-Kanttila","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed55f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053391,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Timo Korhonen","original_name":"Timo Korhonen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed553","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","original_name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed547","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iiris Härmä","original_name":"Iiris Härmä","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed54d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053395,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tuula Mehtonen","original_name":"Tuula Mehtonen","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed565","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053399,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Outi Parkkila","original_name":"Outi Parkkila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed571","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053398,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pirkko Tiitinen","original_name":"Pirkko Tiitinen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b02c3a36847f81ed56b","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053397,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marita Hällfors","original_name":"Marita Hällfors","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec277064e52ed001f389176","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0431839","wikidata_id":"Q107043345","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6259,"name":"psychopath"},{"id":5857,"name":"narcissism"},{"id":10041,"name":"dysfunctional family"},{"id":11925,"name":"domestic violence"},{"id":154796,"name":"overbearing father"},{"id":157154,"name":"psychotherapy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
