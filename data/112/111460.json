Even when Mr. Wade of the Chicago Cubs comes to get him, it is only because Nellie spurns him that he goes. As always, Elmer is the king of batters and he wins game after game. When Nellie comes to see Elmer in Chicago, she sees him kissing Evelyn and she wants nothing to do with him anymore. So Healy takes him to a gambling club, where Elmer does not know that the chips are money. He finds that he owes the gamblers $5000 and they make him sign a note for it. Sad at losing Nellie, mad at his teammates and in debt to the gamblers, Elmer disappears as the Cubs are in the deciding game for the Series.","popularity":1.0584,"poster_path":"/2lNbJrJHRHF39oiI84PmDcpRZDm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":9329,"logo_path":"/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png","name":"The Vitaphone Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A pennant Winning Panic About Base ball and Blondes!","title":"Elmer, the Great","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe E.
