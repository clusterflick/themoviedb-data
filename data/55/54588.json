In Guerdon Trueblood's teleplay, the ghosts of a bomber crew hang around their derelict plane, awaiting the day that their bones will be recovered and given a decent burial. The sole survivor, navigator Russell Hamner, has in the intervening 25 years become a General. He joins an investigation team that has come across the wreckage, while the ghosts, headed by Major Devlin, plot to expose Hamner as a coward who deserted his post and left his crew mates to die.","popularity":1.8,"poster_path":"/uuCUp9VxbVSvPkGSnvxWHGKwM7V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Center 100 Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sole Survivor","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vince Edwards","original_name":"Vince Edwards","popularity":0.5067,"profile_path":"/goXXCXM1YFH0kiQ2Lw8TO0BudoI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maj.
