The limo was rigged with digital cameras, a computer, a television, a stereo, and a cell phone. Generated entirely by this four-wheeled media machine, No Maps for These Territories is both an account of Gibsonâ€™s life and work and a commentary on the world outside the car windows. Here, the man who coined the word \"cyberspace\" offers a unique perspective on Western culture at the edge of the new millennium, and in the throes of convulsive, tech-driven change.","popularity":0.5142,"poster_path":"/329157hdloFLqZzyq7BoFQKEszS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
