Leaving a city of deeply devoted fans in shock and disbelief. What caused owner Robert Irsay to turn his back on a town that was as closely linked to its team as any in the NFL? Academy Award-winning filmmaker Barry Levinson, himself a long-standing Baltimore Colts fanatic, will probe that question in light of the changing relationship of sports to community. Through the eyes of members of the Colts Marching Band, Levinson will illustrate how a fan base copes with losing the team that it loves.","popularity":1.1044,"poster_path":"/bDJlzcGrD0B2bLK4dsiT0AW22WE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Severn River
