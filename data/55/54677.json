The vaunted Yankee lineup, led by A-Rod, Jeter, and Sheffield, had just extended their ALCS lead to three games to none, pounding out 19 runs against their hated rivals. The next night, in Game 4, the Yankees took a 4-3 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning, then turned the game over to Mariano Rivera, the best relief pitcher in postseason history, to secure yet another trip to the World Series. But after a walk and a hard-fought stolen base, the cold October winds of change began to blow. Over four consecutive days and nights, this unlikely group of Red Sox miraculously won four straight games to overcome the inevitability of their destiny. Major League Baseball Productions will produce a film in \"real-time\" that takes an in-depth look at the 96 hours that brought salvation to Red Sox Nation and made baseball history in the process.","popularity":1.9002,"poster_path":"/o49Y11zT4B68iXdWIXq3jSHQsGa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17037,"logo_path":"/w9le4FUeXVlKLfnlkuk1djRrena.png","name":"ESPN","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN
