On the surface Prophet Hills seems like a perfect place to live and raise a family, but Danny Kessler (Baldwin) has seen better days. This is one man's journey to find the culprit of the ultimate sacrifice he's endured. He must face his demons and go back to the place that has haunted him.

He must make them believe that something evil is living beneath their own backyards.","popularity":0.7722,"poster_path":"/tAoGWRbYkl7ufR8IYGf4hhscdfA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Something Evil Is Living Beneath","title":"Born of Earth","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Kincer","original_name":"Jennifer Kincer","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Kelly Williams","credit_id":"52fe488bc3a36847f816cdc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Dourif","original_name":"Brad Dourif","popularity":1.5961,"profile_path":"/o9f0fHMF1Jo0PDCjz2r1dneolwS.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"The Mayor","credit_id":"52fe488bc3a36847f816cdd1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Baldwin","original_name":"Daniel Baldwin","popularity":0.9282,"profile_path":"/8dp3G3EvnQrp3awh4gc1nNsI60j.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Danny Kessler","credit_id":"52fe488bc3a36847f816cdd5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Russo","original_name":"James Russo","popularity":1.0576,"profile_path":"/nubhNb5OUkzsrndD1BNqzp7MGyo.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Tom Reeser","credit_id":"57035de3925141625400063e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Arthur Lewis","original_name":"James Arthur Lewis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/pSib9UjfuWP0jEIBJuyIJWM3erz.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"Dept.
