And yet, all of that was a prelude to O.J. Simpson leading America on a slow speed chase in a white Ford Bronco around Los Angeles.","popularity":0.3872,"poster_path":"/28CtIohJBm99wbmDfQlUiQx3Bm3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17037,"logo_path":"/w9le4FUeXVlKLfnlkuk1djRrena.png","name":"ESPN","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The day sports took a backseat to surreal","title":"June 17th, 1994","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Morgen","original_name":"Brett Morgen","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/r1vaHshdJYlzJBmI2RG6yuiqYOd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48aac3a36847f8173335","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316845,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryan M.
