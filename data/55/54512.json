Over a thousand armed resistance groups took refuge in the inaccessible forests of the Carpathian Mountains where they waited in vain for the support of the Western Allies. One of them was led by Ion Gavrilă-Ogoranu, who managed to remain undetected until 1976 when he was arrested. This film depicts the daily existence of this group. It tells the story of a struggle that became an end in itself, as the enemy was constantly in pursuit and arrest meant torture and often liquidation. Hungry and emotionally withdrawn, the group of young men got entangled in a partisan war that could not be won, lost in the landscape of the South Carpathians, accompanied by a vigilant secret police, the Securitate.","popularity":0.2865,"poster_path":"/9JPZt7HL8NbTYdTdNx8ff7cgz8X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmex Romania","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2010-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":163,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of the Fighter as a Young Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constantin Diţă","original_name":"Constantin Diţă","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/8aqeivkIAHg6FPEL7GxMfDy7pLe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ion Gavrilă Ogoranu","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f8171443","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ionuţ Caras","original_name":"Ionuţ Caras","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/d0E9e2AHIjyd5Ur3Ke4wWmrIvhb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gheorghe Haşiu","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f8171447","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catalin Babliuc","original_name":"Cătălin Babliuc","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ion Chiujdea","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f817144f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ion Bechet","original_name":"Ion Bechet","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nelu Novac","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f8171453","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasile Calofir","original_name":"Vasile Calofir","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Andrei Haşiu","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f8171457","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constantin Lupescu","original_name":"Constantin Lupescu","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":"/4NkMJVRTvjE3ibPwKpVhB5dTg83.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ion Ilioi","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f817145b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Bordeianu","original_name":"Dan Bordeianu","popularity":0.2187,"profile_path":"/ud8SdS5O3QiComDGo3rOsX0zrEf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Victor Metea","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f817145f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandru Potocean","original_name":"Alexandru Potocean","popularity":0.2037,"profile_path":"/ez05oJrNIeKyj60ygfyJfWnEQO7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Toma Pirău","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f8171467","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alin Mihalache","original_name":"Alin Mihalache","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Gheorghe Şovăială","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f817146b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radu Iacoban","original_name":"Radu Iacoban","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/cTMw9vdP10u9U7Safi5HrE3kv10.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Gelu Novac","credit_id":"52fe48a0c3a36847f817146f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogdan Dumitrache","original_name":"Bogdan Dumitrache","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/Dclz20fRLYWoyfh5ffBN0motyS.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Laurian Hasiu -
