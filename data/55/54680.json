The best offer he could find came from an obscure small college with little history of basketball. In the same city where he had won an NBA championship with Magic and Kareem, Westhead was determined to perfect his non-stop run-and-gun offensive system at Loyola Marymount. His shoot-first offense appeared doomed to fail until Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, two talented players from Westhead’s hometown of Philadelphia, arrived gift-wrapped at his doorstep. With Gathers and Kimble leading a record scoring charge, Westhead’s system suddenly dazzled the world of college basketball and turned conventional thinking on its head. But then, early in the 1989-90 season, Gathers collapsed during a game and was diagnosed with an abnormal heartbeat. Determined to play, Gathers returned three games later, but less than three months later, he tragically died on the court.","popularity":0.4445,"poster_path":"/8lLSxM9AW0PpaemH3U6Z8tUHmWV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":17037,"logo_path":"/w9le4FUeXVlKLfnlkuk1djRrena.png","name":"ESPN","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The only time they stopped running was to remember","title":"Guru of Go","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3526521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Westhead","original_name":"Paul Westhead","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/t0C90TKFtTs30y9C07f0igXQQ4O.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64582b536aa8e000ff5a7a83","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Couturié","original_name":"Bill Couturié","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61081e307719d7005d9c9dbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46360,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gregory S.
