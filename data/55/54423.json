In addition to his penchant for much younger women, Chaplin was unjustly hounded by Senator Joe McCarthy's notorious anti-Communist witch hunts, for which the U.S. revoked his visa in 1952. A bitter and disenchanted Chaplin responded by moving his family to Switzerland, where he remained until his death in 1977. This documentary chronicles Chaplin's life and career during those so-called \"forgotten years\" (during which he became a prolific and highly respected film-score composer) through previously unreleased archival footage and intimate interviews with his friends and family, including his children Geraldine, Michael, and Eugene.","popularity":0.7843,"poster_path":"/d2qnUej4yQpItJSMijM2VNt2uuC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2003-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charlie Chaplin: The Forgotten Years","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Chaplin","original_name":"Eugene Chaplin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f817056b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Chaplin","original_name":"Geraldine Chaplin","popularity":1.6829,"profile_path":"/hu9GC4GaJhgsjz99IrmO5YnzHiC.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f817056f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Chaplin","original_name":"Michael Chaplin","popularity":0.2003,"profile_path":"/hl3jwLvxz5gDc4ZT0kwWJkZjbpm.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f8170573","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petula Clark","original_name":"Petula Clark","popularity":0.4837,"profile_path":"/qSoK1NlmDPZANWdGwVivsLcmzpf.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f8170577","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur Cohn","original_name":"Arthur Cohn","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/4elUZlTRNjY7OzzIY44Dg7zBfyH.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f817057b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Loren","original_name":"Sophia Loren","popularity":3.8588,"profile_path":"/94Kglg5dsAgOKG76230FFN7m6W3.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f817057f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Ustinov","original_name":"Peter Ustinov","popularity":1.0841,"profile_path":"/7GHLBhcNCiRugTcUt76HgtkZCUg.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f8170583","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felice Zenoni","original_name":"Felice Zenoni","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f8170563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Beat Hirt","original_name":"Beat Hirt","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f817055d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Beat Hirt","original_name":"Beat Hirt","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f8170589","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felice Zenoni","original_name":"Felice Zenoni","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe489ac3a36847f817058f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0381082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5tBfT179HcTiMH6QQOjuO10Snfs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/obRqsDaGVgbpHPfXWgglUA3CbZS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pQ1S0VOCHvUlqyFgwk4gSl1vLNM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1374,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d2qnUej4yQpItJSMijM2VNt2uuC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":916}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
