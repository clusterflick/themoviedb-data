Toby, just out of college in Wisconsin, comes to Manhattan to spend the summer with his older cousin, Packard, a gay man whose lover John R. has just died of AIDS. Toby is shy, the openly-gay society around him makes him nervous. Packard gives Toby a pair of John R.'s shoes; when Toby puts them on, he has powerful visions of the pre-AIDS scene in the 1970s, as if he's there. He also takes on a different personality when he wears the shoes, more sure of himself, able to express his interest in men. Wearing the shoes, Toby goes to a bar, hooks up with Dick, and wakes up in Dick's bed. How will he handle it? And what will happen to the shoes?","popularity":0.4457,"poster_path":"/rLHR8zsBa7sOF2byxrPtZWSb3pg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frameline","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dead Boys' Club","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat DeWolf","original_name":"Nat DeWolf","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/f0DTojHndQBUUW3xgbXdfTGFNYd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Toby","credit_id":"5b2f4509c3a36843c5002c8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2916392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Van Der Wilden","original_name":"Erik Van Der Wilden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fec2c31d7107e003f28a289","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2916393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Decker","original_name":"Matt Decker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fec2c43a5d849003de4e24e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2916394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ari Benjamin","original_name":"Ari Benjamin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fec2c5ccc277c003f08f93c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":164283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas J.
