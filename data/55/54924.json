The story plays in a single day towards the end of World War II in a rough, snow-covered landscape where a German soldier escorts his prisoner with orders to shoot him. The background of the story is formed by the flashbacks of the partisan soldier being interrogated by a Russian commissar who wants to know all about him being taken prisoner. The German soldier Helmut Kampen escorts the captive partisan who is condemned to death but finally manages to flee. The commissar wants to know why the Germans did not kill him and accuses the partisan soldier of collaboration","popularity":0.5133,"poster_path":"/ye9rfmjUZNIA9s1xJ7aDZIHvh3Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2007-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rozhovor s nepriateľom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Facing the Enemy","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Rozhovor s nepřítelem","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Igonda","original_name":"Marko Igonda","popularity":0.2126,"profile_path":"/ygisZlOwvO1ETbEbTqhc3ZfwF2g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helmut Kampten","credit_id":"52fe48b3c3a36847f8174f4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika Hilmerová","original_name":"Monika Hilmerová","popularity":0.3052,"profile_path":"/jQ7HHyYdFJfepfIgnufrW6VKyhS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"52fe48b3c3a36847f8174f51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Štefan Kvietik","original_name":"Štefan Kvietik","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/gcWjtvZP3DZdxeVSf9a01Dlht9o.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5882d69dc3a36806430042d5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrik Lančarič","original_name":"Patrik Lančarič","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58716666925141355900dada","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1734688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Pavlac","original_name":"Peter Pavlac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587166edc3a3684f2300ea6a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1051864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ye9rfmjUZNIA9s1xJ7aDZIHvh3Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1563,"name":"prisoner"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Itafilm","release_date":"2007-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
