Nine-year old Caro lives on a pig farm in a small town with her four other siblings and another on the way. She is curious and determined to understand the mysteries of the world around her. But her devout catholic father can't explain the new world and her mother is too busy for philosophy so she converses to God. One day at school she is horrified to learn that man will soon set foot on the moon. In her eyes it's not possible that God would allow anyone to get so close to Heaven. Her clowning father agrees and, unable to cope with modern-day progress, hits the bottle. Caro is preparing for her first holy communion to become 'a bride of God' but before that she seals a pact with her father to overcome her fear of swimming in exchange, he will not touch a drop of alcohol.","popularity":0.3117,"poster_path":"/kpASFlLfLejQvo9zZbU6llTT7rZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isabella Films B.V.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2003-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Weiter als der Mond","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huub Stapel","original_name":"Huub Stapel","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/Ar41d7m6EA9eHGc7sMYTligjA77.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mees Werner sr.","credit_id":"52fe48adc3a36847f8173d39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna ter Steege","original_name":"Johanna ter Steege","popularity":0.3112,"profile_path":"/ufMX0nu3F0N25qclKF6UJuDGMGy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ita Werner","credit_id":"52fe48adc3a36847f8173d3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":87832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neeltje de Vree","original_name":"Neeltje de Vree","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Caro Werner","credit_id":"52fe48adc3a36847f8173d41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nyk Runia","original_name":"Nyk Runia","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mees Werner jr.","credit_id":"52fe48adc3a36847f8173d45","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annet Malherbe","original_name":"Annet Malherbe","popularity":0.214,"profile_path":"/xAzQjXPop7fEfyOEFNqmW9IiSMv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tante Masha","credit_id":"641c7df8a3e4ba00830bb4c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kees Hulst","original_name":"Kees Hulst","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":"/nTtH1bcqSzuDc7PezzcqkNHgkET.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"641c7e05142ef1007b40b27f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stijn Coninx","original_name":"Stijn Coninx","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/rw9sdCRhj0tnjtzLA07WfXONpZK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48adc3a36847f8173d35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacqueline Epskamp","original_name":"Jacqueline Epskamp","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5422ef930e0a263b6e001987","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19989,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ludo Troch","original_name":"Ludo Troch","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c7e5e142ef100f8bf814b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16673,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henny Vrienten","original_name":"Henny Vrienten","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c7e3fb9a0bd007ba8a1b7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24721,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walther van den Ende","original_name":"Walther van den Ende","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6474f9e8924ce600dcb28e0d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0313752","wikidata_id":"Q2241055","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/kpASFlLfLejQvo9zZbU6llTT7rZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
