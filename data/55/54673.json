However, a new kid comes to town determined to force him back into racing so he can take his title--and he's already taken his girlfriend.When his younger brother, Steve, is killed racing a hot-rod, Jeff Northup blames himself for the accident since he had built the car for his brother and had encouraged him to race it, with other boys on a special course provided by police detective Ben Merrill, who is working to reduce the city's hot-rod fatalities by providing supervision for the dangerous hobby. Jeff withdraws from participating in races on Merrill's course and, without his leadership, reverts to racing on the streets. \"Bronc\" Talbott, a newcomer, makes a play for Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Vernon. Eventually, the taunting-Talbott forces Jeff into a race which results in the death of a bicycling child, and evidence seems to indicate Jeff was at fault.","popularity":1.4452,"poster_path":"/j0Qzkg2MHo0QIwSAHdGr88GwwMk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18812,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nacirema Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":9266,"logo_path":"/lRinQ7scVye5N8qkUIoCB4QXbRh.png","name":"American International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Teenage terrorists tearing up the streets!","title":"Hot Rod Girl","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lori Nelson","original_name":"Lori Nelson","popularity":0.2743,"profile_path":"/vw1Bm71Vr9qSx5o9TK716MSvxX5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lisa Vernon","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f8173255","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Connors","original_name":"Chuck Connors","popularity":1.2222,"profile_path":"/6RfyJxavZhtMR3zLiUwg9M30GmG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Detective Ben Merrill","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f817324b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Smith","original_name":"John Smith","popularity":0.3026,"profile_path":"/ks2h2JJ354VGQRTn3DMkHR0xlhk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jeff Northrup","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f8173259","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Andrews","original_name":"Mark Andrews","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bronc Talbott","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f8173263","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":151005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxanne Arlen","original_name":"Roxanne Arlen","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/wNbN4QSU8AQqiSBJG9y3pY5IbX5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"L.P.","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f8173267","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Gorshin","original_name":"Frank Gorshin","popularity":0.4528,"profile_path":"/lGRDnt0HlOI3BGOLD5mFUwNi6QI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Flat Top","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f817326b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Essler","original_name":"Fred Essler","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/2u5gH1wJQ761TaD8TiJ0qWQYDH9.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Yo-Yo","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f817326f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Ryder","original_name":"Eddie Ryder","popularity":0.1787,"profile_path":"/tWqGKaXPkpHoWtJ7vEtiONK2WZp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Two Tanks","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f8173273","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Kearney","original_name":"Carolyn Kearney","popularity":0.1547,"profile_path":"/3YAGhaNpp3StqLnBwEasPyVfYub.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f8173277","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Del Erickson","original_name":"Del Erickson","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Steve Northrup","credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f817327b","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie H.
