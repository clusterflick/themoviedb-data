He dons sunglasses and waves as she runs down a stairway to the river's edge, then watches in horror as she's knocked flat and loaded into the back of a hearse. In vain, he gives chase. Disconsolate, he buys a large funeral wreath and a handkerchief from sympathetic vendors. He removes the glasses to wipe his eyes and realizes they are the cause of all his woe. He replays the farewell without the glasses.","popularity":0.5978,"poster_path":"/hxz3xHtDoV5K4UJA5x8HNnSTtN0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rome-Paris
