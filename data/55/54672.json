Nicknamed “El Toro” by his fans, Fernando Valenzuela ignited a fire that spread from LA to New York—and beyond. He vaulted himself onto the prime time stage and proved with his signature look to the heavens and killer screwball that the American dream was not reserved for those born on U.S. soil. In this layered look at the myth and the man, Cruz Angeles recalls the euphoria around Fernando’s arrival and probes a phenomenon that transcended baseball for many Mexican-Americans. Fernando Valenzuela himself opens up to share his perspective on this very special time. Even 20 years later, “Fernandomania” lives.","popularity":0.4755,"poster_path":"/iOWqbUbg16Lu9iPaFHMB5Z8qsNV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17037,"logo_path":"/w9le4FUeXVlKLfnlkuk1djRrena.png","name":"ESPN","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unbeatable translates to any language","title":"Fernando Nation","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cruz Angeles","original_name":"Cruz Angeles","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48a9c3a36847f817322d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435171,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Belardinelli","original_name":"Daniel Belardinelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51c32c0e0a262599012fb5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708321,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Barliant","original_name":"Anne Barliant","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51c33ec3a3680f10013a19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":969493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madeleine Sackler","original_name":"Madeleine Sackler","popularity":0.1718,"profile_path":"/kWLp2c2JARPZA8PgAvVIUvUTwsi.jpg","credit_id":"5b51c34bc3a3680f19013e7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1746635","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hOjY9SgM9HsKa3KSiqjFkdzclfv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ytww8VJQApkXwCU4JOxYxJQsiPZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPmjps5OVDcMdpyGNYXiUlvwXyi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/syzNXAWdQwp9bIa0nfxa4sxWPQ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.402,"height":1293,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sxkrYIIn92vUkQw0svcvUPSeJGP.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3106}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iOWqbUbg16Lu9iPaFHMB5Z8qsNV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aiHU7XJ7C6EUqbP1CLJBtKYqnyO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":12670,"name":"los angeles, california"},{"id":159201,"name":"baseball player"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":267788,"name":"major league baseball (mlb)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Disney+","release_date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
