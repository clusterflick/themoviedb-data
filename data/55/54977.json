What started out as a filmmaking adventure transformed into much more when these boys from Southern California discovered a tragedy that disgusted and inspired them, a tragedy where children are both the weapons and the victims. After returning to the States, they created the documentary \"Invisible Children: Rough Cut,\" a film that exposes the tragic realities of northern Uganda.s night commuters and child soldiers. The film was originally shown to friends and family, but has now been seen by millions of people. The overwhelming response has been, \"How can I help?\" To answer this question, the non-profit Invisible Children, Inc. was created, giving compassionate individuals an effective way to respond to the situation.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/d4OGKLcYUaXo3n2iJJJrqbi89YE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Discover the Unseen","title":"Invisible Children","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Russell","original_name":"Jason Russell","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/s32MCMNkmBA2XXLfP7kcd5v8xif.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"58b0fa6b9251415b1d00394f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Bailey","original_name":"Bobby Bailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"","credit_id":"58b0fa7bc3a3680778003722","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laren Poole","original_name":"Laren Poole","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"58b0fa869251415b25003814","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":214478,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carol Mansour","original_name":"Carol Mansour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48b5c3a36847f817565b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Russell","original_name":"Jason Russell","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/s32MCMNkmBA2XXLfP7kcd5v8xif.jpg","credit_id":"58b0fa989251415b4800372c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0855841","wikidata_id":"Q2224187","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gRBFeN73V8ikSbEmsP9VaohXjm8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d4OGKLcYUaXo3n2iJJJrqbi89YE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3PbyAVCVzq9GalM0TaRNBlzxEMF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
