Max (no emotional sophisticate) becomes obsessed, mostly with Kira, but vaguely with his curious lack of conscience as well. Kira, fighting to win a job she hates and running aimless romantic loops, faces the precarious double challenge of choosing a next step and charting a course back to sanity. Good luck leading with your heart, when your heart is an utter emotional idiot.","popularity":0.1762,"poster_path":"/n2xhHCqFQX90KFpNDmO7y5Q1sfn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An unromantic comedy","title":"Sorry, Thanks","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiley Wiggins","original_name":"Wiley Wiggins","popularity":0.5662,"profile_path":"/5ghmT4UGH1MQNeTu5fk9gVa8XlN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Max Callahan","credit_id":"5738ea6a9251414b0300036e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenya Miles","original_name":"Kenya Miles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kira Marks","credit_id":"5738ea77c3a3684d49001236","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Bujalski","original_name":"Andrew Bujalski","popularity":0.2676,"profile_path":"/lBJMtGpoEJ5gtUNDoZVGM8qVPqN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mason","credit_id":"5738ea86c3a3684d4900123b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4405367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ia Hernandez","original_name":"Ia Hernandez","popularity":0.2668,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"6568e4642f8d0900c5d817c2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4405369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donovan Baddley","original_name":"Donovan Baddley","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"6568e482d05a03014df614c8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1620526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dia Sokol Savage","original_name":"Dia Sokol Savage","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5738ea5392514151a0001268","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1113553,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jennifer Lame","original_name":"Jennifer Lame","popularity":0.2223,"profile_path":"/2f2TFugkBlAGbvhaHmrAkfyYws7.jpg","credit_id":"64b6dca90e4fc851a0f516d5","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4168970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Veloski","original_name":"Lauren Veloski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b6dd0be0ca7f01253f1e5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1328183,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jennifer Lilly","original_name":"Jennifer Lilly","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b6dcf50bb07600ae3d92f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":966571,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matthias Grunsky","original_name":"Matthias Grunsky","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b6dcfd0e4fc8519b3f6be4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1162125","wikidata_id":"Q7563717","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n2xhHCqFQX90KFpNDmO7y5Q1sfn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Film Trailer: Sorry, Thanks | Film 2009 | SXSW","key":"vNrXej4hgtM","published_at":"2009-02-24T05:11:19.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6b0c3a3685448005d6c"}]}}}
