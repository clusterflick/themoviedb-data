When Bias dropped dead two days after the 1986 NBA Draft, he forever altered our perception of casual drug use and became the tipping point of America's drug crisis in the mid-80's. Future generations continue to face the harsh punishment of drug policies that were influenced by the public outcry after his heartbreaking death. Instead of becoming an NBA star, he became a one-man deterrent, the athlete who reminded everyone just how dangerous drug use can be. Amazingly, questions still linger about his death nearly a quarter-century later. How good could he have been in the pro ranks? Has he become underrated or overrated as the years pass? How could a University of Maryland superstar and Boston Celtics lottery pick be derailed by a cocaine binge? Was Bias a one-time user as we were led to believe, or was there a pattern of recreational use that led to his fatal last night? Did he fall in with the wrong crowd.","popularity":0.3833,"poster_path":"/iOobeE6Ko83wUVcgCkjJtN0fkXk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4396,"logo_path":"/g76GCLOncS4SKIYfhWT70Zo4ypv.png","name":"NBA Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From sure thing to what if?","title":"Without Bias","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Len Bias","type":"original title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La tragedia de Len Bias","type":"Spanish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4450946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Len Bias","original_name":"Len Bias","popularity":0.0815,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Self","credit_id":"658c5d4b2716717185a51b4f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Fraser","original_name":"Kirk Fraser","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48acc3a36847f8173ac3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189714,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sammy Steward","original_name":"Sammy Steward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c08ef0e9251414792010d4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189715,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chucky Thompson","original_name":"Chucky Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c08ef52925141479e01013b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Leyden","original_name":"Erin Leyden","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c08eeff0e0a2638af012652","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Fraser","original_name":"Kirk Fraser","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c08eedb0e0a2638b8011811","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189713,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kirk St. Patrick","original_name":"Kirk St. Patrick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c08eeefc3a36825280129d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Fraser","original_name":"Kirk Fraser","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c08eee39251414795010fb2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281399,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Dahl","original_name":"John Dahl","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfd64970e0a263807ce4679","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1507574","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gCHqzxIGqy0O3i8SSIg27r2nDgD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1VQM84mH7yHsFYoXZusfU3rEveb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5davEwYebOeJKJZ981cv0wlBQfA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iOobeE6Ko83wUVcgCkjJtN0fkXk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tyE7S7KoRnjMeRXaYvNGzuV41W0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":2150,"name":"cocaine"},{"id":6496,"name":"basketball"},{"id":10614,"name":"tragedy"},{"id":41352,"name":"drug overdose"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":160234,"name":"family tragedy"},{"id":169055,"name":"national basketball association (nba)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"30 for 30 \"Without Bias\" | Official Tv Spot","key":"Afv_4Ku_CG4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-12-29T22:08:32.000Z","id":"6504184f63aad200fe2b55c3"}]}}}
