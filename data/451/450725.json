Van der Keuken leaves the music undisturbed as an autonomous soundtrack and has the images engage in a sort of battle with it. These images are associations, fragments of events, scenes and situations. The film is preceded by a text by Bert Schierbeek.","popularity":0.1999,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1984-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Time","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277038,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Moniek Kramer","original_name":"Moniek Kramer","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/bNNmcHSQZ7EfWnrCGSOp0Pep2J4.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"(as Monique Kramer)","credit_id":"58e52669c3a3684a79021709","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josée Ruiter","original_name":"Josée Ruiter","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/yihkGOkG2PmUrzivKSRDOTFuRVM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58e5268b92514127f0030a39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068697,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Boudewijn Tarenskeen","original_name":"Boudewijn Tarenskeen","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58e526a9c3a36872af02bfcf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Vecht","original_name":"Jack Vecht","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/nkgbTN8S57QyJeiUpC26APYCnT7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58e526d9c3a36872af02bff7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557668,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Dop","original_name":"Jan Dop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e5276dc3a3684a790217b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340606,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Louis Andriessen","original_name":"Louis Andriessen","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e52758c3a36872f602eebc","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790391,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Menno Euwe","original_name":"Menno Euwe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e527b6c3a3684a790217da","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"58e5270bc3a36872af02c026","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790391,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Menno Euwe","original_name":"Menno Euwe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e52725c3a3684a79021788","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936407,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frans Rasker","original_name":"Frans Rasker","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e5274192514127e80316e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790394,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Boersma","original_name":"Bruno Boersma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e5279cc3a36872f602eee1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"58e52782925141281002ea27","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0086440","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181235,"name":"color"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
