On the way he meets Peggy Hughes, accompanying her Uncle Graham, a customs inspector, and he retrieves her hat from the rails of a train. At the headquarters, numerous scrapes and fights win him the admiration of, and friendship with, the men. Lazaro, a Secret Service agent, invites Mrs. Graham and Peggy, who are staying at the border station, for an automobile ride, and they are captured by bandits and held for ransom. Bud and his pals deliver the ransom and discover that Lazaro is the bandit chief. Lazaro refuses to release Peggy, but a jealous rival, Nita de Garma, causes his downfall and shoots him as the Border Police arrive to rescue the party.","popularity":0.3168,"poster_path":"/t8N6siOprjmeLoG2BQBu3s2qVsH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88488,"logo_path":null,"name":"William Desmond Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fightin' Mad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1256044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Desmond","original_name":"William Desmond","popularity":0.1482,"profile_path":"/4ZrHPcaKiybXcApPdG7bF29xvwO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Bud McGraw","credit_id":"58e0e6cfc3a3683d0b01908c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Brown Faire","original_name":"Virginia Brown Faire","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/l4eoQhcLC63jdMKSgEEolsya3gY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Peggy Hughes","credit_id":"58e0e6db9251415e7f01acd8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Pawn","original_name":"Doris Pawn","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/d2d8vvnE5maAAW0tZzmc3LpGTGS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eileen Graham","credit_id":"58e0e6e8c3a3683cff019fe3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nita de Garma","credit_id":"58e0e6f4c3a3683cff019feb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
