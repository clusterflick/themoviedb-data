In May of 1987, 17-year-old Richard Wershe Jr. was charged with a non-violent, juvenile drug offense. By the time of his arrest he was already a Detroit legend, frequently making front-page headlines and leading the local television news. In this film, gangsters, hit men, journalists and federal agents struggle to explain why he remains in prison at nearly 50 years old. The possible explanation is more stunning than the crimes Wershe was alleged to have committed.","popularity":0.6409,"poster_path":"/yp0mFuaUmgV2NSpd5QMymmtNud3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Boy","video":false,"vote_average":7.154,"vote_count":39,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2575995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wershe Jr.","original_name":"Richard Wershe Jr.","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e787ea9357c00001951a551","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2064102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott M.
