Like the latter film, it consists of earlier footage edited in recent years. It could be seen as a sequel to IN THE STONE HOUSE especially since it begins with a cross-country journey to the West Coast, where I settled, and concludes with a visit, in 1987, to the “stone house” in rural New Jersey. Even though there is some sort of time line that can be imagined, the film stands on its own. It is simply a series of episodes that touch upon facets of living in a new area with new weather, new people, new identities and stubborn old fears. The Bolex camera goes to work across landscapes and living areas, workplaces and gatherings. A dance of images: can beauty partner with dread and death? It’s a film of the coexistences that percolate beneath the surface of ordinary events. A film of useless hopes and baseless fears.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7sQpVgiobk7DDeV6LljR9bR7gzL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Shores","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","original_name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/dhJc7fXL8eQovtm6wMQb9cQZY7j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"651a1e94ea84c700eb99e447","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerome Hiler","original_name":"Jerome Hiler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yrnswIx1nrelIf2jhlpogbHfdg5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"651a1ea3a6e2d2011d793fd5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1774574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konrad Steiner","original_name":"Konrad Steiner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"651a1eb9ea84c7014efc3f1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Sherwin","original_name":"Guy Sherwin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/r6otnOKoQjFBlEnOvVQX3J5g2sD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"651a1ec9967cc73425f0aaaf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerome Hiler","original_name":"Jerome Hiler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yrnswIx1nrelIf2jhlpogbHfdg5.jpg","credit_id":"58e3c1d092514127f00218e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6358730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":741,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJVC1ukV70ocCV7biHnV3MewUI1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1318}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7sQpVgiobk7DDeV6LljR9bR7gzL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1005,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lVFTaO1lIRMAmH7zbKkOgL64sYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":754},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1007,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qOpNiy2QjccSAx9LNdgjpScy7SP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":755}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2012-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
