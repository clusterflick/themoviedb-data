Constructing and deconstructing a portrait, she weaves family and friends’ remembrances with an inquiry into her own work process. Her searching attitude suggests that with the loss of her father came a question of the role, not of a particular father, but the father figure—a refusal of authority, and an appreciation of her father’s cycles of learning, teaching, learning. As Danny Kaye, playing Hans Christian Andersen, tells a group of children the story of the piece of chalk that saw itself as a the source, not the transmitter of knowledge, one senses Fonoroff’s sorrow at the loss inherent in the film image, and a yearning for the source of the image, not just its projection.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/ldPLIvwOaY3RNrk6fJJEnEgFKdu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Knowledge They Cannot Lose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Fonoroff","original_name":"Nina Fonoroff","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e687b79251414b28000332","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldPLIvwOaY3RNrk6fJJEnEgFKdu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
