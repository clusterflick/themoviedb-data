She was described as 'acting crazy' and, in fact, was having a mental crisis. She was released into the mountainous region with no cell, no purse, no ID, no car, no way home and vanished. Eleven months later her remains were found in a desolate Malibu canyon. 'Lost Compassion,' shot from ten days after Mitrice went missing, tells the complex, emotional inside story of the search for Mitrice and struggles with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, whose deputies lied about her arrest and likely were involved with her disappearance and murder.","popularity":0.26,"poster_path":"/mjnesmCTNDFY9Njet6fpLOKKCOx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Compassion","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3762006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chip Croft","original_name":"Chip Croft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c24921b7294009487c621","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3681538","wikidata_id":"Q24762877","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bsSFSD7tybysz9vdmd9scHv5ZcK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mjnesmCTNDFY9Njet6fpLOKKCOx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12670,"name":"los angeles, california"},{"id":156091,"name":"missing person"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
