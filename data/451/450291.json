The work has no sound. It lasts for seven minutes.  Martyrs was joined in 2016 by a second piece entitled Mary. The installations have been gifted to Tate, and are on long-term loan to St Paul’s Cathedral.  Bill Viola's commission for St Paul’s Cathedral follows the great historical tradition of commissions for spiritual centres that has resulted in a priceless heritage of art around the world.  The result of this commission sees St Paul’s Cathedral, which has always spearheaded the engagement of great artists, house a resonant work of art for our times. Martyrs (and later Mary), will play an important role in connecting contemporary issues with the timeless themes embodied in the cathedral.","popularity":0.0906,"poster_path":"/e0YM03v9o3kxgGkPKLrI1TFDsmi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Martyrs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/qvXzhdfBNfL7RVaqtmw9STYvUAu.jpg","credit_id":"58e187e292514127f0005626","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e0YM03v9o3kxgGkPKLrI1TFDsmi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2xNGusjB9fNrQTx0uLnltJtN4cd.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
