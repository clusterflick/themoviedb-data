Stratas inhabits the role, exploring the character's sensuousness as she vainly woos Jochanaan, her venomous hatred when she's rejected, the crazed look in her eyes when she demands his head--on a silver platter, no less. Such complete identification with a role, especially of a character so malignant helps make this 1974 Salome stand out among the many fine DVDs of the opera.","popularity":0.1413,"poster_path":"/tQAurwmskqiYd4nKgAyAqCdYycj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1974-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salome","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Stratas","original_name":"Teresa Stratas","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":"/oX1TpVAs5Vadqcx4wz1oBIvtE6h.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Salome","credit_id":"58e2c13e92514127ec013571","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Beirer","original_name":"Hans Beirer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/h79Ef093DGdwaeRcZ6CuiJFEIyh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herodes","credit_id":"5cc22345925141097dff453b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2145123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Varnay","original_name":"Astrid Varnay","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/bspzL8RKJk1BZhsE6t7t6Zpw7j1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herodias","credit_id":"5cc2235b0e0a266b96ff6f65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Weikl","original_name":"Bernd Weikl","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/r8NkIhBstdKCq1FPqE1yn8sRVCu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jochanaan","credit_id":"5cc223760e0a2667bbec7341","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1714003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wieslaw Ochman","original_name":"Wieslaw Ochman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uzXmZcG21PtbLjgXjQbBCv5az4J.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narraboth","credit_id":"5cc2239ac3a3687f8f8d191f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Böhm","original_name":"Karl Böhm","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":"/vWn2Ys2AMzlULNwpFszYCbiyPfO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5cc223bdc3a368694c8e3ec2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Orchestra","credit_id":"5ff91051097c4900419be304","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Götz Friedrich","original_name":"Götz Friedrich","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/1RZWxtRH1w8IC6MEMJd2VgTwo5T.jpg","credit_id":"58e2c14e92514127ec013578","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Strauss","original_name":"Richard Strauss","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yMUgur4kSGUAkMV1ujDKZoJNDri.jpg","credit_id":"5cc223d9c3a368145887814b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0253624","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fUl3O0EaFJjiLj8vgQ4jl5cAIc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gq0dXBsSsH0eB9oWxK7SOaxbHAp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":991},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tQAurwmskqiYd4nKgAyAqCdYycj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
