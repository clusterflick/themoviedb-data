For an entire year Reiner Holzemer documents the precise steps that Dries takes to conceive of four collections, the rich fabrics, embroidery and prints exclusive to his designs. As well as the emblematic fashion shows that bring his collections to the world and have become cult “must sees” at Paris Fashion Week. This film offers an insight into the life, mind and creative heart of a master fashion designer who, for more than 25 years, has remained independent in a landscape of fashion consolidation and globalization.","popularity":0.2764,"poster_path":"/vACmIYy2MICN5fTeX2OZkuGaVeq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reiner Holzemer
