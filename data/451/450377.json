His work has faded from view in the decades since leaving just a dedicated following including Stephen King and Mick Jagger. Holy Terrors is a new film aiming to bring Machen to a new audience and adapts six of his tales into a spine-tingling portmanteau film. Effectively capturing the unique atmosphere and feel of Machenâ€™s writing, Holy Terrors is sure to provide a night or two of uneasy sleep for the viewer.","popularity":0.33,"poster_path":"/tT8E1pzVT2n2ucTIKwEkn7jInad.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Obsolete","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holy Terrors","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633954,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Timothy Greenwood","original_name":"Timothy Greenwood","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"596775899251413462001eaf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3427615,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Joyce Branagh","original_name":"Joyce Branagh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62fc7bab39549a007b4a5f33","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1748913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Peters","original_name":"Lloyd Peters","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Man in Room","credit_id":"62fc7bf05f6c49007d22c8c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Preece","original_name":"Jon Preece","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62fc7c11435abd009156f943","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Lawrence Risdon","original_name":"Jonathan Lawrence Risdon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dr. Haberden","credit_id":"62fc7c32ce997a0082125256","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066365,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Machen","original_name":"Arthur Machen","popularity":0.1854,"profile_path":"/lDwaHKCkrdzqPmJlwp2rbB3tqYR.jpg","credit_id":"62fc7b4e90cf51007a6654de","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666941,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Chatton Barker","original_name":"David Chatton Barker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc7b72435abd009156f91e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1776349,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Theo Kirkpatrick","original_name":"Theo Kirkpatrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc7b8239549a007e40d0fc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666942,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Justin J.
