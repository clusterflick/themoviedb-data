As an architectural tour as well as a tribute to the remarkable architectural achievements of the 60s and 70s and to – among others architects– the great Henri Chomette, a special attention is given to users and passersby, to their gestures and ways of informally appropriating the spaces for their needs. Monumentality appears here as a reminder of the ambitious and utopian vision of an era and architecture itself becomes a metaphor for power that eventually reveals a state of lasting status quo.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/uScgJuCMZvSZ1y1kgSo6eOcvblS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avant l'envol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Bonvin","original_name":"Laurence Bonvin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e350a8925141281901b20d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uScgJuCMZvSZ1y1kgSo6eOcvblS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
