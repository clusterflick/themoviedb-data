But when this great linguist's love for a princess was denied, he just fell in love with her 75 times more. The film is about the remarkable life of a poor priest's son – Georg Julius Justus Sauerwein and his life-long love for Princess Elisabeth of Wied, later Queen of Romania. This is a psychological drama about a brilliant but complex man. His humanitarian values were far ahead of his time. In his day, he was the most vilified person in the German press. Based on Sauerwein's letters and other written sources and narrated from the first person, the film merges the classic fairytale with documentary realism, both in script and visual design, pushing the boundaries of documentary.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/qApNYOOGfwXsmFa0UnFtUD680ls.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fralita Films","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":68872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fumi Studio","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Learning a language is like falling in love.","title":"The Man Who Knew 75 Languages","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justas Valinskas","original_name":"Justas Valinskas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1e03b62385130016a5f77b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3103453,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Agnieszka Borowa","original_name":"Agnieszka Borowa","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6598750e0d11f200eedcc4c3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Magnussen","original_name":"Anne Magnussen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591ec547c3a368791202d22d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1749705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Dębski","original_name":"Paweł Dębski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591ec5729251414ab102f8f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437322,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leiv Igor Devold","original_name":"Leiv Igor Devold","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/cJ3vkLWsqCg9b78buprIe096tdN.jpg","credit_id":"5e1e0384edeb430015df3796","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406687,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mateusz Michalak","original_name":"Mateusz Michalak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b729ede484fc21541a1282","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6920132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":6.614,"height":57,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/iCYkz37Pl8tVQvIxotgPpXrzdcJ.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":377}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qApNYOOGfwXsmFa0UnFtUD680ls.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Annecy International Animated Film Festival","release_date":"2017-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
