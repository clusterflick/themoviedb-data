This controversial 20th century painter defied the world avant-garde of his time: “I don’t follow schools. I am an impressionist, cubist, futurist, abstractionist. A melting pot. The real tradition is not to try and relive the past – which is impossible to achieve – but rather something that sets up a follow-through, as happens with parents and children. A child and his father are never alike.” The film follows Amadeo’s motto. It crosses pictorial fiction – suggested by the emblematic picture “The Procession”, painted in Paris in 1913 – with Portuguese contemporary reality.","popularity":0.1526,"poster_path":"/eyhBb5AFtqtBj2S60qePkQegMcc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Periferia Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crime Abyss Blue Physical Remorse","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2545023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joana Amaral Dias","original_name":"Joana Amaral Dias","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bnLixGuU8iHLYgy4A30fJiywWcv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4ecb459b861600136ac6d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nuno Melo","original_name":"Nuno Melo","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":"/yvlIxQZu1kPH8iVLzmRgzeUtUhC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4ecb4da93d250017449f63","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valdemar Santos","original_name":"Valdemar Santos","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/k7rZIEwureJ7ucQOp7wqIZNhhZQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4ecb55a93d250015442614","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201550,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Quintela","original_name":"Jorge Quintela","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/g4VIZep8HhWTuiq7S1UWdgNWFow.jpg","credit_id":"6259a07371f095009beba74f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800340,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tiago Raposinho","original_name":"Tiago Raposinho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f090b394a87080b73d307","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865220,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ricardo Preto","original_name":"Ricardo Preto","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f091d48333a54d4cb028c","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865026,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vasco Carvalho","original_name":"Vasco Carvalho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f0900904f6d07a27f03a8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799982,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Susana Abreu","original_name":"Susana Abreu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f0912323eba484c87abb9","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1151402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Pêra","original_name":"Edgar Pêra","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/qh7AdTqUlXJP79bGwPgP3RaMzlY.jpg","credit_id":"657f092648333a551fcb0249","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1151402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Pêra","original_name":"Edgar Pêra","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/qh7AdTqUlXJP79bGwPgP3RaMzlY.jpg","credit_id":"58e6f727c3a36873260474ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Abreu","original_name":"Paulo Abreu","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4ecb73a76ac500169e6c29","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1723038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Trabulo","original_name":"João Trabulo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4ecb67a93d250017449fab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4729004","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/eyhBb5AFtqtBj2S60qePkQegMcc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
