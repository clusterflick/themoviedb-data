With the help of prominent performers and producers including Michael Martin Murphey, Robbie Fulks and Ray Benson, Rich explores the early origins of country music in Nashville and Austin. He visits the rustic studios where this much-loved sound was born and discovers how the genre has reinvented itself with influences from bluegrass, western swing and americana.","popularity":0.6575,"poster_path":"/h8F6eLQaXmsjJnY02rrECNewmf1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Mike Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rich Hall's Countrier Than You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Hall","original_name":"Rich Hall","popularity":0.4068,"profile_path":"/yhi9nbWKtgBrVXfAfFJAf18a6Y5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58e0af769251415e48018013","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Benson","original_name":"Ray Benson","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/P6fuXjMylk1N2kAKs6Eo5ViUjT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58e0af879251415e3c017f2e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1788225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbie Fulks","original_name":"Robbie Fulks","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/1wCCW8DKEntiXe6lWft0ZPOvbM9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58e0af97c3a3683d2a0166d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Martin Murphey","original_name":"Michael Martin Murphey","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58e0afa9c3a3683d3e01810f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788223,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark Regan","original_name":"Mark Regan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e9c89e06f98400eb60151b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Hall","original_name":"Rich Hall","popularity":0.4068,"profile_path":"/yhi9nbWKtgBrVXfAfFJAf18a6Y5.jpg","credit_id":"58e0af519251415e5f0181b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178875,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Caveney","original_name":"Anthony Caveney","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e0aef8c3a3683d350177d9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116058,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Beint","original_name":"Andrew Beint","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e0aed8c3a3683d0b01661c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788224,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toby Jones","original_name":"Toby Jones","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e0af379251415e44018859","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Cottam","original_name":"Chris Cottam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8zeVrISbvgz5YD7OAWTBMBSTwhF.jpg","credit_id":"58e0aeba9251415e7f017fb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201483,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John McCormack","original_name":"John McCormack","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e0af0bc3a3683d0b016644","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6699498","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h8F6eLQaXmsjJnY02rrECNewmf1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r9gksCKFcWJ8lgqDn8ZjomJcXN3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":165508,"name":"americana"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rich Hall on Janis Joplin - Rich Hall's Countrier Than You - BBC Four","key":"Rs2YUQ5Jh9Y","published_at":"2017-03-16T10:51:42.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":true,"id":"58e0acea9251415e440186bc"}]}}}
