Eventually caught, Frank was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she later died. The film goes on to explore the concentration camp in detail, the procedures and methods of the camp's commanding officers, and the atrocities the Nazis committed. Shockingly, many of the officers went on to retain their freedom, and lead relatively normal lives, often receiving support from the German government.","popularity":0.0649,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio f端r Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Diary For Anne Frank","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Hellwig","original_name":"Joachim Hellwig","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e49248c3a36872af026f45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Hellwig","original_name":"Joachim Hellwig","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e4925992514127ec02c4c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790125,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"G端nther Deicke","original_name":"G端nther Deicke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e4927692514127e802bd9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287575,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sigrid Gebauer","original_name":"Sigrid Gebauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1a6679251412fb32574f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287573,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Waldemar Ruge","original_name":"Waldemar Ruge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1a6340e0a2626cec61328","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23026,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Hohensee","original_name":"Wolfgang Hohensee","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1a64fc3a3681e7aacfb07","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1462443","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
