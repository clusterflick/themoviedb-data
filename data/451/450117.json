At every moment, the calm she enjoyed, her fine family keepsakes, and also her beloved piano, are in danger, under the impetus of the wild energy of the kids. The two worlds, forced into cohabitation, could not be more distant from each other: on one side, what remains of an affluent class, on the other, the “proletariat” as much in the literal sense as in the figurative one. A question hangs in the air: will the members of this family manage to find a place for each other in their hearts? This is a charming little documentary comedy, a one-room drama which, like a Russian story from the last century, is seen like a shadow of the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oFZ33QG2l30nytus8IXFO6cZJjc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unsettled Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harmony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Garmoniya","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1787936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lidiya Sheynina","original_name":"Lidiya Sheynina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/AjsZtUQ1F3W7ub3nHV9YSQdfUAm.jpg","credit_id":"58dffc5e9251415e4400d794","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1787936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lidiya Sheynina","original_name":"Lidiya Sheynina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/AjsZtUQ1F3W7ub3nHV9YSQdfUAm.jpg","credit_id":"5d075c5e9251411a82cdb4ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1787936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lidiya Sheynina","original_name":"Lidiya Sheynina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/AjsZtUQ1F3W7ub3nHV9YSQdfUAm.jpg","credit_id":"5d075c4c9251414008b8d59c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1787936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lidiya Sheynina","original_name":"Lidiya Sheynina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/AjsZtUQ1F3W7ub3nHV9YSQdfUAm.jpg","credit_id":"5d075c579251411a82cdb495","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6603854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oFZ33QG2l30nytus8IXFO6cZJjc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel Film Festival","release_date":"2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man Film Festival","release_date":"2017-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOC NYC","release_date":"2017-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
