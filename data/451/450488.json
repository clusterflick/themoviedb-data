Introduced in the intimacy of this experimental microcosm which redefines completely the common sense of domestic life, Ila Bêka recounts in a very spontaneous and personal way the unique personality of the owner: a urban hermit living in a small archipelago of peace and contemplation in the heart of Tokyo. From noise music to experimental movies, the film let us enter into the ramification of the Mr. Moriyama's free spirit.  Moriyama-San, the first film about noise music, acrobatic reading, silent movies, fireworks and Japanese architecture!","popularity":0.2254,"poster_path":"/doQsaQD25bzsYE6Xzrta7nbyyID.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bêka &
