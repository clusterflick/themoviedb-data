The series, Universal's last attempt at competing with Republic Pictures' many streamlined B-Westerns, also featured the bucolic Fuzzy Knight as Grant's sidekick. Grant and Knight are undercover U.S. marshals tracking down a gang of counterfeiters. To their surprise, they are soon assisted by a beautiful Mexican dancehall performer, Dolores Mendoza (Armida), who proves to be an undercover agent as well, in her case for the Mexican rurales headed by Captain Garcia (Francis McDonald).","popularity":1.0259,"poster_path":"/cvUTxfFr3k8e4QGWsikenw6FZPU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bordertown Thrills!","title":"Bad Men of the Border","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirby Grant","original_name":"Kirby Grant","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/vLBy90EuTjddHNFEB772iXHP4zM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ted Cameron","credit_id":"58dfa337c3a3683d0b008ac0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuzzy Knight","original_name":"Fuzzy Knight","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/vv3sXhvCEpZxeG8WucH4p6JdaYl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mortimer P.
