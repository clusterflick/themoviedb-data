Natasha, 12 years old, knows these instructions by heart. So, while waiting for the storm, she laughs and fights, suffers heartbreak, attempts to negotiate the purchase of a new swimsuit with her father. With zest and delicacy, with clear complicity with the body of her young heroine, Elizaveta Kozlova captures the details of a day-to- day life which, although ordinary, never seems insipid, so deeply is it infused with the contagious energy of the protagonist. And as the lines of contemporary Russian society and its problems are sketched out, In the Eye of the Storm reveals itself as the portrait of a character undergoing tremendous change.","popularity":0.141,"poster_path":"/fednjgmigfF7lrRNkgZ3zOrKlAN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102208,"logo_path":"/m3NGbr5cr4XIF80L7BZzccEUsVl.png","name":"M.
