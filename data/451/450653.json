For more than a century, non-native species of plants, fish, invertebrates and microscopic organisms have been silently invading the Great Lakes, leaving devastation in their wake. Invasive species like Asian carp, zebra mussels and more are transforming the ecosystem from top to bottom, pushing some native species to the brink of extinction, and costing the region hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Narrated by Bill Kurtis, “Making Waves” traces the path of the invasion and joins researchers on the front lines as they combat invasive species and work to restore native species, in an effort to prevent a biological takeover of the Great Lakes.","popularity":0.1943,"poster_path":"/tylJL3ZJiKgkxzLI1vTZwAwgy2X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Battle for the great lakes","title":"Making Waves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Kurtis","original_name":"Bill Kurtis","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/7aYRruBTH3YEr6J1heEPXpB9et3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"641eef64d6dbba007cd46cfa","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4GqKT2D9P0CO7whXyl5KRVClYj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/94zuipuI6GvKZNN6PcO32QBDG5k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5sGrkdCFweUr5BrtBnx5H3RcVJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tylJL3ZJiKgkxzLI1vTZwAwgy2X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
