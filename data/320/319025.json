Annabel gives theatre performances in the auditorium of a Dutch university and Dudley is completely in love with her. They have a fantastic weekend together, but then she disappears as mysteriously as she had come. Dudley embarks on an endless quest that is stiff with Poe symbolism. It takes him to the red light district of Amsterdam, but also to the jet-set of Berlin and the beaches of the Baltic Sea.","popularity":0.4207,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Spur führt ins Verderben","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Hoenig","original_name":"Heinz Hoenig","popularity":0.7131,"profile_path":"/7UEy95iM0OLLThG26ZdLL0H8vPt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dudley Potter","credit_id":"54bb0f569251416eae0003e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Mannkopff","original_name":"Andreas Mannkopff","popularity":0.1315,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54bb0f5fc3a3686c6b0087a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdy Mayne","original_name":"Ferdy Mayne","popularity":0.3111,"profile_path":"/7l73nDzdFBae78sEaY4xWxEmRV4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Granitzki","credit_id":"54bb0f689251416e9b0003d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Mira","original_name":"Brigitte Mira","popularity":0.3219,"profile_path":"/aTscEqH9GSbQDlT7hnKFilvzNkf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frau im 'House of Usher'","credit_id":"54bb0f709251411d6a007876","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Volkert Martens","original_name":"Max Volkert Martens","popularity":0.1198,"profile_path":"/dzX1QG6O1xCU9EJWrXIWkGpCC9R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0e00ecc3a3686286000715","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belinda Mayne","original_name":"Belinda Mayne","popularity":0.1528,"profile_path":"/tgTsVHu96vG389Eqbg0YOnr0GFa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0e00f8c3a36862800007c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1485228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Bothor","original_name":"Stephanie Bothor","popularity":0.1523,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Annabel Richter","credit_id":"5a0e010b92514138f600074a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolf Gremm","original_name":"Wolf Gremm","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/uIOsiqAR9oxot9VqKdx8bCqqiwz.jpg","credit_id":"54bb0f47c3a368145e0049fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0108209","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
