A young boy lives with his grandmother in a city where people use small airplanes to get from place to place. He drives a taxi plane, and during one of his travels he bumps into a bird that has been shot by the boy's latest customer. The bird, as well as a hungry bear he meets next, offer him a reward for his help. Men cause many problems for animals - is there a way to help them stay out of trouble?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1932-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Plane Cabby's Lucky Day","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Plane Cabby's Lucky Day","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ôatari sora no en-taku","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teizô Katô","original_name":"Teizô Katô","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54bbbbb192514148b0005822","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0443299","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
