They speak against the backdrop of a church which has fallen into disrepair, while a choir of homeless people and Pieter Jan Leusink’s Bach Choir & Orchestra rehearse the Passion.  Leusink isn't just the conductor, he is one of the main characters himself, with a painful past in which this musical piece has played a dominant role. Stories from the others alternate seamlessly with this. We learn how the St Matthew Passion played a decisive role in the relations between men and women, fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, mothers and their unborn children, and finally that in spite of our differences we all find a common denominator in the secret of Bach's music.","popularity":0.4324,"poster_path":"/i7r5MtOiRUNwLviTtuAjOPjZHA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44439,"logo_path":null,"name":"KeyDocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erbarme dich - Matthäus Passion Stories","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pieter Jan Leusink","original_name":"Pieter Jan Leusink","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54bd698e9251411d6a00be18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Enquist","original_name":"Anna Enquist","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54bd69a4c3a368389c004dd7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emio Greco","original_name":"Emio Greco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54bd69b3c3a3686c6b00d4fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sellars","original_name":"Peter Sellars","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/jnpWmiRJ8AvGlVq87liEiuQbgvo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60665c76ebb99d0041993fa9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Halsey","original_name":"Simon Halsey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60665c9b2cefc20058b90ea4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramón Gieling","original_name":"Ramón Gieling","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60665c239f5dfb00415f37e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":13500,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hans de Wolf","original_name":"Hans de Wolf","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60665c2c0ff15a007212e33f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramón Gieling","original_name":"Ramón Gieling","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54bd678e9251416eae0045dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4362388","wikidata_id":"Q29052044","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/36BN1it6Qlm65qtwmMPOAVM4wiO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i7r5MtOiRUNwLviTtuAjOPjZHA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":637},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bLiPGZIOueW8DGlGEEle5DK5S4s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":201055,"name":"johann sebastian bach"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Erbarme Dich (regie: Ramon Gieling) - teaser","key":"LhEz_doLekQ","published_at":"2014-11-12T12:33:03.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54bd6814c3a368389c004db9"}]}}}
