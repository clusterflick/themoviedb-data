(1932). Directed by Slatan Dudow, the crew and cast included left-wing luminaries, such as playwright Bertolt Brecht, composer Hanns Eisler and balladeer Ernst Busch. The film was the subject of vehement disputes and was banned twice for revolutionary and communist tendencies that were perceived to threaten the state. About 230 meters of the original film fell victim to the censor’s shears.  This historic censorship case was argued over the course of three sessions. Censored: Kuhle Wampe re-enacts the censorship hearings, based on original minutes and documents, as well as personal records of the case. In addition to footage from the original film, this docudrama includes original clips of Berlin in the 1920s and '30s and short testimonies, filmed in the 1970s, with some of the actors involved in the original Kuhle Wampe film production.","popularity":0.4698,"poster_path":"/7dIsNL4fMJH3hQYkkpeiv9zTxPQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":23372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fernsehen der DDR","origin_country":"XG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Censored: Kuhle Wampe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Censored: Kuhle Wampe","type":"DEFA release title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Geschonneck","original_name":"Erwin Geschonneck","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":"/lvmPb5nUnFXxKrRoIcX9xeq6P9F.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5e2d5c9b66f2d20017d60132","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Böwe","original_name":"Kurt Böwe","popularity":0.144,"profile_path":"/dOCXUSkf0KzqJAJB1lPSzHCPXp3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e2d5ca24ca676001447c49c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Greese","original_name":"Wolfgang Greese","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":"/1SP1MGUFZv6uMlEvpDgL3PAQ8Kr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e2d5cac66f2d20017d601cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürgen Holtz","original_name":"Jürgen Holtz","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":"/FKY2fcxvNBSjQEScwmlYrIIl9x.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5e2d5cb166f2d20013d6174f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Kalisch","original_name":"Peter Kalisch","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5e2d5cb9c56d2d00134c8edc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Pelikowsky","original_name":"Erika Pelikowsky","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5e2d5cbf1685da0017e831a1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Lohse","original_name":"Wolfgang Lohse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5e2d5cc84ca676001447c503","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik S.
