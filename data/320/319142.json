Looking more like a mellow, mid-life surfer than hairy rock icon from the 1980s, the ever-expansive Hagar leads the Waboritas through a long, hot 2002 tour, sharing a bill with David Lee Roth, Hagar's co-outcast from Van Halen. Despite their shared ignominy, Roth rebuffs Hagar's efforts at collaboration, or at least camaraderie, resulting in a competitive and entertainingly catty atmosphere.","popularity":0.3523,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Road to Cabo","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammy Hagar","original_name":"Sammy Hagar","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/2WK3zgPJ8Hxwwu879z0Tj0hYI1H.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54bbc1579251416e9b001933","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Anthony","original_name":"Michael Anthony","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/5AQRLGq1Umr50uscE5xEVAJTYeg.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54bbc20592514148b000589c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vic Johnson","original_name":"Vic Johnson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54bbc3b9c3a3681421005262","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Gnader","original_name":"Mona Gnader","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"54bbc3ed9251416eae001795","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lauser","original_name":"David Lauser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54bbc3fec3a368389c001a83","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0360751","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
