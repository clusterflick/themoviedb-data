A place to meet and hang out, local bar, grapevine, a place to buy anything you might need out of hours. A place to forget your worries. Where there is always time for the customer. Every night and all day Sunday. With reggae, dub &amp; hip hop playing out of the speakers onto the street. Tommy, the Englishman, has worked in the Spaetkauf for years, selling the wares and dealing with arguing couples, lost tourists, drunken locals, late night discussions, participating in heated basketball games, visiting late night clubs and suffering hangovers. A kaleidoscope of people offering glimpses into their lives, hopes and thoughts, weaving a tapestry of local life.","popularity":0.4549,"poster_path":"/jhv0E7ysG2sWNKWWVcgUmnAJaPJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom Atkins Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Arranz","original_name":"Sebastian Arranz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Sebastian","credit_id":"5bd4435892514103960136d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1885548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra-Maria Cammin","original_name":"Petra-Maria Cammin","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/yZfbPIpvPSx8aoK5uaajFhUFQcu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emilia Galoppi","credit_id":"5bd443710e0a2622bd0158ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian T.
