The man uses the mortar to become the richest person in the village. But the man's greedy brother steals the mortar and, determined to enjoy all the luxuries by himself, climbs into a rowing boat and heads for an isolated island. On the way, however, he asks for salt from the mortar, but then cannot figure out how to stop it. Finally, the boat sinks under the weight of all the salt, and the mortar sinks to the bottom of the sea where it is pouring out salt to this day.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1935-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Is the Sea Water Salty?","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Why Is The Sea Water Salty?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yasuji Murata","original_name":"村田安司","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/tjDW6gWuJ2KMBgr4noDTLsucHc0.jpg","credit_id":"54bbef2dc3a3681411005900","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0438532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
