It sparked controversy when it was shown across the country in 1935, during the midst of the worst depression in Canadian history, and with a growing anxiety over the increased aggression of international dictators. The film provided a contested venue for what the Great War had meant to a generation of Canadians. But this was no ordinary war film. Officially sanctioned and constructed from archival footage, the story of Canada’s war was told in 100 minutes, from the opening phases through to the grim fighting on the Western Front, and including those who supported the soldiers from home. Many journalists, politicians, and veterans called Lest We Forget the most authentic film to have appeared since the end of the war, especially in contrast to Hollywood fictional productions.","popularity":0.1629,"poster_path":"/sT0zycAcZABoStCSUTLRoR7pLIb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1935-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lest We Forget","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rupert Caplan","original_name":"Rupert Caplan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"54bc47949251416e600025cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Carney","original_name":"George Carney","popularity":0.1163,"profile_path":"/hGpAh4peiguj3GzFryKSX0LkOJW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54bc479ac3a368389c00282d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"W.W.
