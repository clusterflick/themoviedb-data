Carpenter)(Vane Calvert) of Smokey Smith (Bob Steele) are murdered while traveling with a wagon train that is attacked by outlaws. Smokey swears revenge but his only possible chance lies in finding the member of the border-gang who took a ring from his father's finger. The sheriff (Earl Dwire) of a nearby border town makes Smokey a deputy after the latter saves his life when outlaws attack a stagecoach the sheriff is escorting. This enables Smokey to find the hideout of the gang that killed his parents, and he, posing as a wanted man, is able to join the gang. He soon incurs the wrath of gang-member Kent(Warner Richmond), who is jealous over the attention that Bess Bart (Mary Kornman, step-daughter of the gang-leader, \"Blaze\" Bart (George 'Gabby' Hayes), is showing Smokey.","popularity":0.4467,"poster_path":"/kuSEcbq8oLNWlnXm3qpVaBujJti.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supreme Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ALIVE WITH WESTERN ADVENTURE!","title":"Smokey Smith","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Steele","original_name":"Bob Steele","popularity":0.3453,"profile_path":"/jOaQFxwyNWRNEEdRoiiRaOVrOpK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Smokey Smith","credit_id":"54be74e69251411d7700d453","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kornman","original_name":"Mary Kornman","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/xl7dNI3feY6Mv3Xyxr2JA9iQuAM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bess Bart","credit_id":"54be74f1c3a3684046008531","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George 'Gabby' Hayes","original_name":"George 'Gabby' Hayes","popularity":0.5123,"profile_path":"/fnTYZNc8Vy7lLJs3xl5GWSHGVSA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Blaze Bart","credit_id":"54be74fac3a3686c6100cc02","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Richmond","original_name":"Warner Richmond","popularity":0.1698,"profile_path":"/l0z8tTtr6YQyVnbIGnQBEIeQP0R.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kent","credit_id":"54be7503c3a3684046008534","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Dwire","original_name":"Earl Dwire","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":"/1DZox89bVEBbTC2yu5UBLNCvO6I.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"54be750bc3a3681da00042d8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horace B.
