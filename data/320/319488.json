His mother was a dog too. George made different sounds, which made his mother take him to the vet/veterinarian. A veterinarian/vet will take an animal's health and temperatures. The vet said \"Please bark, George\" every single time after George's mother went on very desperate. Which was a reference to when George made strange sounds a dog doesn't say, George's mother tells before it happens, \"No, George. A ___ goes \"___\". A dog goes \"arf!\" Now bark, George.\" Good thing George said the right thing. But before it happened, the vet put on his latex gloves and pulled out the animals.","popularity":0.6056,"poster_path":"/xdgeDWMFEJHDFpgeaZ5mVKiNapO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":"/qTvhJHw5ixJX9t0cR81cF4eVvfO.png","name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bark, George","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lithgow","original_name":"John Lithgow","popularity":2.2714,"profile_path":"/8Y1sjBdnVR483S8PrnAQzlESwhx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6188417e0752880044dab2fb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gene Deitch","original_name":"Gene Deitch","popularity":0.2276,"profile_path":"/6E6XdQCbcqTepyyJXYmnxXQ4lWR.jpg","credit_id":"61884198595a560090f435e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Feiffer","original_name":"Jules Feiffer","popularity":0.2283,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662dc86bf6fd18012522b0b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xdgeDWMFEJHDFpgeaZ5mVKiNapO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
