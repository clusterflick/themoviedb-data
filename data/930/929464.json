Talk about glass ceilings is usually associated with women’s opportunities to advance to well paid managerial positions, but the documentary connects itself more broadly to the structural problems of work life from women’s perspective. Glass ceilings are long trials about equal pay, having to continually prove one’s skills, and 85-cent euros. The topic cannot be handled without intersectional crossings: what are invisible glass ceilings for some, are solid concrete for others.","popularity":0.6029,"poster_path":"/jKhAbocLHwg9T4R6oW8cJjrcV0v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170371,"logo_path":null,"name":"LPMA Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Glass Ceiling: What is it?
