But when years later her children turn the camera onto her, she is forced to confront her motivation for filming their lives in this searching and searingly honest cinematic exploration of identity, belonging and motherhood. Filmed over the course of 27 years, Mother Land challenges us all to examine the landscapes we carry within us and the narratives we create to make sense of our lives.","popularity":0.4073,"poster_path":"/rE9f49kJTKVODQHNpJ4UkN9rpyn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170371,"logo_path":null,"name":"LPMA
