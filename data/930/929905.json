The fragmentary images of the various women are chained together in a discontinuous manner, and as a whole, a dry eroticism with ambiguous meaning drifts from the screen. The laughter, murmurs, and screams of the women overlap to form a unique internal world that the artist, a woman, has captured with her physiological sensibility. A film that attempts to confirm the uncertainty of our existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ljjLndIocOu6HgEmlB5tiGJ0xSy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pool for Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakagishi Eri","original_name":"Sakagishi Eri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61ec5c515541fa006da402f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinohara Yuko","original_name":"Shinohara Yuko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61ec5c5dcd20460092343f4a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nishimoto Tetsuro","original_name":"Nishimoto Tetsuro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61ec5c64d75bd600c9280949","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mori Anno","original_name":"Mori Anno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ec5c41d75bd6006a6930f7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mori Anno","original_name":"Mori Anno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ec5c2acedac4004350d004","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mori Anno","original_name":"Mori Anno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ec5c361ad93b00430be921","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mori Anno","original_name":"Mori Anno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ec5c31e4886000428d3751","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ljjLndIocOu6HgEmlB5tiGJ0xSy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
