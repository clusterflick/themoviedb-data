Line planes, helicopters, ultra-lights: BEA is investigating everything that flies. For the first time, they have allowed cameras to film their often confidential work. This documentary meets technicians and meteorologists, even ophthalmologists and acousticians, who are able to determine the causes of an accident from detailed details. It also follows the two-year search and recovery effort for an aircraft engine that went missing over the Greenland Ice Sheet.","popularity":0.3851,"poster_path":"/qh8jWngPvWOPZ5m0zjE30NGvUmB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":110993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elephant Adventures","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Détectives du ciel","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaël Leiblang","original_name":"Gaël Leiblang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65449b7e1ac29200ffeaf458","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4354729,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"François Ducroux","original_name":"François Ducroux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65449b657719d700c51ee5aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis-Pascal Couvelaire","original_name":"Louis-Pascal Couvelaire","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e9966eb513a800bc0159bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3943445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Audrey Avram","original_name":"Audrey Avram","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe7ad4cf62cd00852f909d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19251742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ts7gLDlbvY6uuXctuAaziW91gww.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p2HhzOP11J7MPkAVdbfOb1foVwN.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5GEezA7cvhPk7kgEYo0aKUFPd7q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qh8jWngPvWOPZ5m0zjE30NGvUmB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mH8F1CtO6mrT3mXIA3rQaND9Fe0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5340,"name":"investigation"},{"id":186696,"name":"jet crash"},{"id":189402,"name":"crime investigation"},{"id":249530,"name":"plane crash"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":282692,"name":"air crash"},{"id":301626,"name":"aircraft crash"},{"id":318428,"name":"airplane-crash"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 5","release_date":"2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
