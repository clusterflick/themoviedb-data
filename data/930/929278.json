Produced, edited, and slapped together by the man himself. Put together from old footage and edited entirely on an Apple G4 laptop with iMovie, this never-before-seen documentary captures the life of the ALC in a rugged, yet personal, rough-around-the-edges fashion. \"I have absolutely NO knowledge of film making, editing, or anything associated with movies, but one day I was messing around on the laptop and I realized that editing footage was a lot like beat-making! So, on the spot, I said Fuck It! I'm gonna make a DVD, right here, me, in my living room, on my laptop, out of all this footage I got laying around. And I sat up for one week straight, got into a creative mode, and went berserk! Shit was fun.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hfXUhiWN637tyraJlTcbz125m4z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Uncut Version","title":"The Chemistry Files - The DVD","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":970,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hfXUhiWN637tyraJlTcbz125m4z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
