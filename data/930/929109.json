An art film that just exists and breathes and whispers to your libido. Inspired by Magritteâ€™s \"The Treachery of Images\", I non-verbally argue that the one-sided representation of sex in media, whether through sensationalized click bait disguised as journalism or the male-dominated pornographic vision, strips sex to an act that nullifies its complexities and emotions. Created with absolutely no budget, this piece proves that there is a place for sex in art.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kuDOdnxiNBnok1gVzzFg1VWnw40.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Treachery of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Treachery of Love (This is Not a Porn)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3390562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"June Ann D'Angelo","original_name":"June Ann D'Angelo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61e956d6a0b6b5011dd2ce55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3390562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"June Ann D'Angelo","original_name":"June Ann D'Angelo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e956d0aa659e0090017ec0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3390562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"June Ann D'Angelo","original_name":"June Ann D'Angelo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e956f1fdf8b70043da0b8b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390563,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olmedo","original_name":"Olmedo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e95700cd204600922f84d4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390563,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olmedo","original_name":"Olmedo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e9570ea0b6b5001cf912b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390563,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olmedo","original_name":"Olmedo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e95714aa659e001b4008da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13412536","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kuDOdnxiNBnok1gVzzFg1VWnw40.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Burnt Video Art and Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2022-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"L'H International Film Festival ","release_date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"dreammachine international film festival","release_date":"2020-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Meet The Directors - June Ann D'Angelo (The Treachery of Love)","key":"_yDhBQXM3yU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-10T09:08:17.000Z","id":"61e957d0a0b6b500a750f96e"}]}}}
