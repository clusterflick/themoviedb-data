Real warfare ensues however when a fated encounter involving an oddball mystic and the gift of a mysterious rock set in motion a zombie apocalypse of anime proportions in which all assholes are transformed into zombies. Will Rocket and his best friends be able to embody the heroes they revere, donning their cosplay armor and collectible katanas and traversing a zombie-infested LA in order to save Mom? An anime-inspired action-adventure that explores the battle between good and evil within oneself, ZombieCON is a testament to the power of friendship, self-sacrifice and heart.","popularity":0.3074,"poster_path":"/2seqNPCwRlDYKu1CCRIgmih8D12.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cosplayers Stuck in a Zombie Apocalypse of Anime Proportions.","title":"ZombieCON","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3392071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny Luke","original_name":"Manny Luke","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/A9HPTHK5h8eDpGT899UgsoqRY14.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rocket","credit_id":"61eb08f4d75bd600459d573c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3392072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Aine","original_name":"Erin Aine","popularity":0.2025,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"61eb0902df2945008efc9591","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2386815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Punkie Johnson","original_name":"Punkie Johnson","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/4plRlKYpRA1wO0GBu8z140dosFs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Punkie","credit_id":"61eb09105f622b006911169c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3392076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Casillas","original_name":"Christian Casillas","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ftMcbMiSO9y4hYAKCK9ItutBkK8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Javier","credit_id":"61eb09249ca75900fca1778d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Mendez","original_name":"Carlo Mendez","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/Adu7t4MvViROnSAvyr8QK2aZgR9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Zander","credit_id":"61eb0933a9117f0091035212","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":450950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chandler Darby","original_name":"Chandler Darby","popularity":0.377,"profile_path":"/huQeUE59gjxWqqpgeWpcasQeSOC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Trevor","credit_id":"61eb096cea37e0496d134e05","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1077909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nichole McAuley","original_name":"Nichole McAuley","popularity":0.2526,"profile_path":"/feSyGYiztqCkR8cWVEYnnDjkRmF.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mama Bear","credit_id":"6459a58b77d23b017037ad62","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
