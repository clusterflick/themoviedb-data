Two years ago her husband Michi died in an accident. Julika still misses him sorely, even speaks regularly to his mailbox. Nevertheless, she embarks on an affair head over heels with the easy-going bicycle city guide Konstantin. For her loving, but sometimes encroaching parents-in-law Georg and Christa, the case is clear: the affair with Konstantin can only be a temporary aberration. After Michi's death, both of them stood by the mourning young woman and the children. The family is very close and even lives on the same piece of ground. With Konstantin, this whole well-established family structure falls into disarray. But is that what it feels like? Can there be a second great love for Julika?","popularity":0.4319,"poster_path":"/zDsIGqbTXGlJHeNqE4oc0ZqQRlN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1986,"logo_path":"/wSvwGEYGUsUkDb2kyrlJZQxONdj.png","name":"Hager
