A fictional acceptance researcher tries to mediate between the fronts of the anti-nuclear movement and the police. With his sociological lectures, the committed scientist often contrasts the political utopia of the opponents of nuclear power with the given political reality in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Exciting ironic-self-critical nuances in the documentary material, which shows the turbulent events in the Wendland in the 1980s.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wendländische Filmkooperative","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zwischenzeit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Fölster","original_name":"Jochen Fölster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Akzeptanzforscher Dr. Gollwin","credit_id":"61eb1d8b31644b00941429f6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Bolbrinker","original_name":"Niels Bolbrinker","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/k3QJKcgl4kHbRF58b0Kp0Sx8uXZ.jpg","credit_id":"61eb1d485f622b006911359b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roswitha Ziegler","original_name":"Roswitha Ziegler","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eb1d30976e4800daeb5b42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978460,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gerhard Ziegler","original_name":"Gerhard Ziegler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa70661bc639566adaa669","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Fölster","original_name":"Jochen Fölster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa707ad3ab7d7a8baddb92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0335576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
