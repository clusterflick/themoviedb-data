And that is precisely where this film portrait follows him. For eight months, German director Andreas Ammer accompanied the charismatic conductor. He observed him in rehearsals with the SWR Symphony Orchestra, which Currentzis leads as chief conductor since 2018. He has visited him at his former place of activity in Perm, where he led the opera house from 2011 to 2019 and launched his career through meticulous work with his ensemble musicAeterna. He accompanied Currentzis on guest performances and had numerous conversations with him. The result is a many-faceted portrait of the impressive musician, who sees his profession also as a spiritual mission.","popularity":0.4742,"poster_path":"/CdDfvFuKX0T6H8D1B3bsMe9TuV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Language of Our Dreams – The Conductor Teodor Currentzis","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Язык нашей мечты – дирижер Теодор Кутентзис","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61ec3d83ce5d8200c89471d5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2085831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Ammer","original_name":"Andreas Ammer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ec3ee55f622b00ba69672c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393321,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Klaus Ritter","original_name":"Klaus Ritter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ec464f6d4c9700d59eea9d","department":"Production","job":"Head of Production"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Lang","original_name":"Joachim A.
