But that is a long time ago. The couple separated four years ago - Arthur had fallen in love with a much younger woman. This relationship failed since Arthur fell ill with dementia. Despite all the bitterness, Elsa still feels responsible for Arthur and is looking for a place in a nursing home. In order to be able to finance this, the house on the lake has to be sold - but against Arthur's will. For clearing out and repairs, the two hire 45-year-old Sorin, who lives alone on a houseboat and works as a DJ. Sorin and Arthur get along great right away. First, there are violent arguments between Elsa and Sorin. But slowly Elsa and Sorin are getting closer. Suddenly things are brought up that have been repressed for years.","popularity":0.2337,"poster_path":"/bhN2mSIhumFet5YryiTnaLW4zWs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90219,"logo_path":"/q1zjFnBBwZrQjy1dVtnvdwo7VWh.png","name":"Flare
