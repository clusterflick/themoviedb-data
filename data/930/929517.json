The locals tell stories of the strange optical illusion above the lake, the earliest sightings of which date back to the 18th century. According to some, it’s the devil himself; others claim it to be Pajari, a character so evil that even the devil didn’t want him. The present-day sightings become a part of the meteorite lake’s folklore.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devils of Paasselkä","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel Straschnoy","original_name":"Axel Straschnoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eacfed31644b0059dc9ca7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
