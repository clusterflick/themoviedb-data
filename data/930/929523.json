Everyone can choose for themselves, whether they want to actively seek contact with the animal and whether they want to entertain or be entertained by the alpaca. The alpaca either responds or doesn’t, in its own manner. With the tender approach, Morrison & Friends invites questions about our anthropocentric worldview and explores the coexistence of species.","popularity":0.0998,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morrison & Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Lehtonen","original_name":"Paula Lehtonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ead1d93faba00111943d4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Lehtonen","original_name":"Paula Lehtonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f01b676d4c9700d5a4b77c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paavo Lehtonen","original_name":"Paavo Lehtonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f01b79be2d49006b786483","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Lehtonen","original_name":"Paula Lehtonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f01b876af9dd00919254f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kristian Ekholm","original_name":"Kristian Ekholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f01bb102842000c17fc082","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
