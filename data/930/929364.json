Running the pizza parlor, however, is not as easy as first thought and within a month the boys are on the brink of bankruptcy. As always, it comes down to that one fateful phone call that changes everything- a seemingly typical order instantly alters the nature of the pizza business and the boys' lives. Their delivery unintentionally assists the customer in committing suicide, however, he leaves the boys such a generous tip for their aid, that they quickly realize how lucrative 'facilitating suicides' or ' consensual euthanasia' is.","popularity":0.5994,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miridien Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When taking an order is as easy as taking a life","title":"Salvador's Deli","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Z'Dar","original_name":"Robert Z'Dar","popularity":0.7703,"profile_path":"/8NM28DeYwECvI5i6fVpcRNh1Vt8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Salvador","credit_id":"61ea35fe394a8700f0829942","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Mansueto","original_name":"Steven Mansueto","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Joey","credit_id":"61ea365afdf8b7001b86e72d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vince Murdocco","original_name":"Vince Murdocco","popularity":0.21,"profile_path":"/fdDd2rErSrlbclqvjaOxqVhunWd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Danny","credit_id":"61ea3671fdf8b7001b86e74a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig March","original_name":"Craig March","popularity":0.2619,"profile_path":"/m6TgOvDikmW09GYJu9t5nkoq0wT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61ea36799c97bd00e6797f1b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357334,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trevor Mirosh","original_name":"Trevor Mirosh","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ea3691a0b6b500a7533693","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Tuit","original_name":"Mark Tuit","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/gX3JgFqcTGdwmMhbxQp0wYMcSTD.jpg","credit_id":"61ea369a41eee1001bbe76ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391374,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steven Vitali","original_name":"Steven Vitali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ea36ce394a873d47d688fd","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357334,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trevor Mirosh","original_name":"Trevor Mirosh","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ea36dcfdf8b700c34d3e90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43925,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Sliwinski","original_name":"Adam Sliwinski","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ea36f1df294500b808773a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1617180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
