When Noemí de Miguel asks him what he felt after getting back behind the wheel of a Formula 1, the Alpine driver does not hesitate: «It has been fun to feel the adrenaline of racing again, of competition. I think I'm going to experience many things again and I look forward to doing so. Everything was exciting, those first laps and being in the fight with the other cars has been a bit of adrenaline that continues to rise. Even though the two cars in front of you are fighting, you already have a little excitement and your heart beats a little faster.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/3D1out3JA4aChiU4qV53FZ7ZZX1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alonso 2021, el origen del plan","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3D1out3JA4aChiU4qV53FZ7ZZX1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
