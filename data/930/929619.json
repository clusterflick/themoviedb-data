Water contamination spreads throughout the village pipelines and one cybergoth finds herself laying on a hospital bed. The film is a visual poem narrated by a group of young inuit women, reflecting on ongoing suicide attempts and the separation from their families. The cybergoths remind us of a post-apocalypse future, that is to say, the apocalyptic qualities of the present; a fragile reality where national, communal, environmental, and mental stability is at risk.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/3iJDyl6XbxP8pWL0ITkOdAlmCCO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GL","name":"Greenland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Kalaallisut","iso_639_1":"kl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Hole Legion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3392228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Omer Mizrahi","original_name":"Jonathan Omer Mizrahi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eb30a2713ea600d14f12ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3392229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariel Sereni Brown","original_name":"Ariel Sereni Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eb30b2713ea600d14f12fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3iJDyl6XbxP8pWL0ITkOdAlmCCO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":904}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.filmschoolfest-munich.de/en/program/films/film/?id=40&f=115","release_date":"2022-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
