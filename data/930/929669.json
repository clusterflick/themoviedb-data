As a young girl, marriage to her older cousin leads to years of control and frustration. Rebelling against her husband, she eventually relocates to France with her sons, building a new life. As she voices her own story, the film weaves her experiences together into a broader narrative of self-determination. She carves out her independence in suburban Paris and finds comfort in the everyday. A simple kind of happiness follows, the sparrow is free.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/dnMeIfss3qNkx0kd5SyMxDYb0lK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sparrow is free","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niki Kohandel","original_name":"Niki Kohandel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eb5db94df291001ba0a558","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.76,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e8Y17731alCfiuPw3l9LbsVySSI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":821},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/svVHWdpSYgzOpyVK0aPqX8OUUkv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dnMeIfss3qNkx0kd5SyMxDYb0lK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Director's Instagram (SHASHA July Programme)","release_date":"2021-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
