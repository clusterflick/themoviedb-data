Among other finds, primate fossils from millions of years ago have been discovered in the region. But what about the region’s modern inhabitants and their relationship to their environment? Iiris Härmä, whose previous work includes the award-winning Leaving Africa, had the chance of joining Helsinki University’s researchers, Álvaro Fernández-Llamazares and Mar Cabeza, on their pre-pandemic trip to study the Daasanach people’s relationship to their environment through traditional animal tales. The researchers hope that storytelling would help to bridge the gap between people’s everyday lives and conservation efforts.","popularity":0.4856,"poster_path":"/44I8kLXEaTj7ITqkzdHNfflt8cV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guerilla Films Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shepherds of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álvaro Fernández-Llamazares","original_name":"Álvaro Fernández-Llamazares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f97f9ebb105700d307c4db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mar Cabeza","original_name":"Mar Cabeza","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f97fbeb6abc40044509749","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iiris Härmä","original_name":"Iiris Härmä","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eab574c669ad0058f0db91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","original_name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f97e9368929c001b440e4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iiris Härmä","original_name":"Iiris Härmä","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f97eb107216600e0123cda","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1593714,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matti Näränen","original_name":"Matti Näränen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f97f2cfe6c182eb878c35e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","original_name":"Visa Koiso-Kanttila","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f97f43559d220091493a84","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610585,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Per Störby Jutbring","original_name":"Per Störby Jutbring","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f97f59cb8028001c548908","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janne Laine","original_name":"Janne Laine","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/7RMPfxYRGusRg2KDyMLr1xUxbq9.jpg","credit_id":"61f97f739e401200a85509a7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17677686","wikidata_id":"Q113521676","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/44I8kLXEaTj7ITqkzdHNfflt8cV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3664,"name":"research"},{"id":5946,"name":"ethiopia"},{"id":9895,"name":"kenya"},{"id":194775,"name":"african tribe"},{"id":291901,"name":"daasanach people"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
