It speaks of the shared space between a woman devastated by her illness and an astronaut determined to take part in the first crewed mission to Mars. The film shows how their lives traverse a space that preserves, in a way, a sense of symmetry. Both speak with the filmmaker, who attempts to explore the limits of the human being—and her own limitations when making a film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symmetrical Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5865556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montse Cid","original_name":"Montse Cid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69375548314af76f62638082","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5865558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soushiro Matsubara","original_name":"Soushiro Matsubara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6937557d78446420e0eb1877","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1475602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia García del Pino","original_name":"Virginia García del Pino","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/3DjUD1MSCzWWYoxLjR6FowsZxmY.jpg","credit_id":"6937558b69b54cf6d106995f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1475602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia García del Pino","original_name":"Virginia García del Pino","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/3DjUD1MSCzWWYoxLjR6FowsZxmY.jpg","credit_id":"6937559b39c6b5ca6606991f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1475602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia García del Pino","original_name":"Virginia García del Pino","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/3DjUD1MSCzWWYoxLjR6FowsZxmY.jpg","credit_id":"693755a5fc17c6feec6380ca","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1475602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia García del Pino","original_name":"Virginia García del Pino","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/3DjUD1MSCzWWYoxLjR6FowsZxmY.jpg","credit_id":"693755b64aeaa403b40699e4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1475602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia García del Pino","original_name":"Virginia García del Pino","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/3DjUD1MSCzWWYoxLjR6FowsZxmY.jpg","credit_id":"693755c362303aadb8aefc56","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1475602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia García del Pino","original_name":"Virginia García del Pino","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/3DjUD1MSCzWWYoxLjR6FowsZxmY.jpg","credit_id":"693755d138e89295c9f8711d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5865560,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miquel Hervás","original_name":"Miquel Hervás","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693755f3e40a0cf0a5638115","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kikol Grau","original_name":"Kikol Grau","popularity":0.2787,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6937560ebc71ec2d9ef7cab2","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Punto de Vista","release_date":"2010-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
