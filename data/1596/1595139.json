Through summer adventures, everyday challenges, and moments of quiet courage, this poetic, character-driven film reveals a form of “vision” shaped by resilience, friendship, and the conviction that blindness is not a limitation but another way of being in the world. Filmed over more than a year, Sight Unseen centers on five remarkable teens, their community of similarly abled peers, and the woman who has dedicated her life to guiding and advocating for them. The film gently, yet powerfully, challenges assumptions about ability, identity, and what it means to live a meaningful life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sight Unseen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Graziano","original_name":"Michael Graziano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936fc9cf0078b9c0813436d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Graziano","original_name":"Michael Graziano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936fcb850431dcf88f7c89a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
