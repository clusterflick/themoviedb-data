At the height of this flood, 24-year-old Tae Prakanwutthisan, then unemployed, invested his resources to purchase three rolls of black-and-white 16 mm films, despite the war making film scarce. He rented a boat and, accompanied by friends, embarked on documenting the flood. Their efforts captured not only the extent of the flood but also significant events such as members of the House of Representatives traveling by boat to attend a parliamentary meeting at Ananta Samakhom Palace. This footage includes key figures in Thai political history, such as Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena and Prayoon Phamonmontri, making it a valuable visual record of that era.  Originally silent, Tae Prakasawutthisan narrated the footage himself in 2006.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bangkok Flood 1942","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5866680,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tae Prakasawutthisan","original_name":"Tae Prakasawutthisan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"693818d70d5fa54a36eb1c42","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5866680,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tae Prakasawutthisan","original_name":"Tae Prakasawutthisan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693818b105c5e584d2eb2184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5866680,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tae Prakasawutthisan","original_name":"Tae Prakasawutthisan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693818be5698514d99aeff0c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"th","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
