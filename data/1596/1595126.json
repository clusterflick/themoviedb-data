In this intimate cinematic letter, Israeli filmmaker Roy Cohen addresses his Palestinian friend and fellow peace activist Aseel Aslih, who was murdered by Israeli police in their youth. Cohen tells Aslih of his experiences navigating a growingly genocidal society and seeks Aslih’s moral clarity and resilience in the evocative letters he had written as a teenager.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bkAAyyhljHGnFHzFNWuRPHSQzFO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Far from Maine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Cohen","original_name":"Roy Cohen","popularity":0.2871,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f7fd80cd6b4e6a48f22c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3534701,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Serge Gordey","original_name":"Serge Gordey","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f825932ca1cf5405d948","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864809,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Svejgård Lund","original_name":"Anne Svejgård Lund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f849af7a103a92d20507","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864812,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudio Esposito","original_name":"Claudio Esposito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f88382375ca71805db63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864813,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sára László","original_name":"Sára László","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f8b240b88b118217b7f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864816,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolas Wadimoff","original_name":"Nicolas Wadimoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f8db5dec86487524431d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864819,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Aune Falch","original_name":"Christian Aune Falch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f92aba9f4c10f1d20525","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2239624,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Torstein Parelius","original_name":"Torstein Parelius","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f948a1a21707a4c1fc37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864822,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Leandro Monti","original_name":"Leandro Monti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f973c120af9f4005da31","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864825,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valentina Cicogna","original_name":"Valentina Cicogna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f9be9c131597b205d997","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bkAAyyhljHGnFHzFNWuRPHSQzFO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
