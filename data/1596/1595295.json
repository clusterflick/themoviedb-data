In addition, toasts are exchanged, and awards and bottles of wine are presented to people who got engaged, married or had babies since the last party.  In the earliest days of the show, Richard Hunt took it upon himself to provide entertainment for the parties, for one party, cameraman Frank Biondo was given the role of introducing one of Hunt's acts and from then on, he served as the organizer and emcee for the live show, eventually he was granted a full stage so they could set up the show.\r Includes an \"adult version\" of the song People in your neighborhood, sung by Bob McGrath.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mWUKd3Q8jirG816B2BmW25bFC8u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sesame Street 1986 Wrap Party","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2771701,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frank Biondo","original_name":"Frank Biondo","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself (host)","credit_id":"69374c8eba37638a48eb1815","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroll Spinney","original_name":"Caroll Spinney","popularity":0.4201,"profile_path":"/rYn1E9Um326MA1sWCEBlMCFkRGD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Big Bird / Oscar the Grouch","credit_id":"69374d8719f8104c701344fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hunt","original_name":"Richard Hunt","popularity":0.5812,"profile_path":"/itvasFV2Qgnrsx4ejAaUTT7KAYj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69374de805c5e584d2eb1908","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5865513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Baer","original_name":"Joe Baer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself (acting)","credit_id":"69374e9748bb2cbba33ce562","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5865527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Elizabeth Houston","original_name":"Michael Elizabeth Houston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Little girl","credit_id":"693750ec9bc1d5b349eb17a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob McGrath","original_name":"Bob McGrath","popularity":0.9157,"profile_path":"/xDwdfIfNuiBzxIlKGjHusYG08vY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69375129b12d073015f870ee","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Clash","original_name":"Kevin Clash","popularity":0.7731,"profile_path":"/yZ5EdQQvjifJ0hLh8CU7Ug7kz1e.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Conman, Himself / Hoots the Owl","credit_id":"693755d68a1090de391344a4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":219195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pam Arciero","original_name":"Pam Arciero","popularity":1.4534,"profile_path":"/cSD9o23QeAJYFPHqQlyKotTEJNi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lady of the night","credit_id":"6937582727877a4d6e7fc30d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin P.
