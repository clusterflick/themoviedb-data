Inspired by Almost, Maine’s “Sad and Glad,” the film follows a chance encounter between two emotional “almosts” stuck in an awkward loop of repeated pleasantries and missed connection. The story unfolds in real time with cutaway interviews that reveal Jimmy’s inflated confidence and Sandrine’s assured rejection. As tension peaks, the film shifts into a National Geographic–style nature documentary, reframing the interaction as a failed mating ritual. Shot on iPhone with improvised dialogue, ALMOST, JIMMY satirizes ego and conversations that refuse to end.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An awkward encounter, observed in the wild","title":"ALMOST, JIMMY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Bumgarner","original_name":"Will Bumgarner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"6938707d4a80395b92eb1d59","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexia Watkins","original_name":"Alexia Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sandrine","credit_id":"69387091cb46fdca64f7cf7d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaiah Nelsen","original_name":"Isaiah Nelsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Interviewer & Waiter","credit_id":"693870afba37638a48eb1e84","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Nelsen","original_name":"Daniel Nelsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693871d83a2ac05b80f876d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Nelsen","original_name":"Daniel Nelsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693871f0026b2696c3eb1d9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry Stone","original_name":"Henry Stone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69387210fba8170955f87715","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4415276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Stone","original_name":"Henry Stone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6938723df4f8df9f8beb1c5a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Nelsen","original_name":"Daniel Nelsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693872a279b1f575bf638696","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
