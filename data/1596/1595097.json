Four images of dancer Cheryl Nayowitz move past and through images of Israel and words spoken by the Holon Scratch Orchestra, along with music by the ensemble Gray Code. The film and its music are anchored by the song “Sachki Sachki,” sung by Vered Forbes.  The film has no story, dialogue, or characters (other than the dancer). While there is text in Hebrew and English, you don’t need to know either language to enjoy the film. The English is a dreamlike text scrambled to approximate what you might hear while falling asleep. The Hebrew words which are heard and seen onscreen during much of the film are streams of consciousness, improvised by women’s voices on the themes of segments of the film. When we hear the song “Sachki Sachki,” the words appear onscreen both in the original Hebrew and in an English translation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2025-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A dream in dance of coming to life in Israel","title":"dreamtext","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"דברי מלום","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Nayowitz","original_name":"Cheryl Nayowitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"6936e8ca5af5486a2e70b36e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holon Scratch Orchestra","original_name":"Holon Scratch Orchestra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Voice Performer","credit_id":"6936f080f7208738464e53b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gray Code","original_name":"Gray Code","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Music","credit_id":"6936f09f150d22d81324449b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vered Forbes","original_name":"Vered Forbes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Song Performer","credit_id":"6936f0c133b079094770b593","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Zitt","original_name":"Joseph Zitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936e9198a17d799df17b9e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Zitt","original_name":"Joseph Zitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936ec4c13523a41084e535d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Nayowitz","original_name":"Cheryl Nayowitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936ec63bf293cefc448f5c4","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Zitt","original_name":"Joseph Zitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f2a5679558987f70b4ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Zitt","original_name":"Joseph Zitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f2b767651264572444ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Zitt","original_name":"Joseph Zitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f2d2ba9f4c10f1d204ed","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Zitt","original_name":"Joseph Zitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f2e3130074b3b805dcb4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Zitt","original_name":"Joseph Zitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f305aadd46352ec1fdc5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":14529,"name":"improvisation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
