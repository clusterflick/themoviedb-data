Once Malawi's high-security prison, it now shelters over 53,000 displaced people from war-torn countries like the DRC, Burundi & Rwanda.

Their hopeful voices echo through the relentless monotony of daily life, expressing universal human emotions and questions.  ​But once a year, the Tumaini Festival transforms the camp into a vibrant celebration, drawing over 50,000 attendees. For a brief moment, it shatters the harsh reality of camp life and brings them out of the shadows.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x3KqzulptDXo3lv2yBqtuCtpAKM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Name Ourselves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3727066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandra Alcala","original_name":"Alejandra Alcala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f305d631c31a3848f346","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Garcia Martinez","original_name":"Alex Garcia Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f32bf7208738464e53d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5864775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francisco Alcala","original_name":"Francisco Alcala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6936f34870e7745cfb05dab2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x3KqzulptDXo3lv2yBqtuCtpAKM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
