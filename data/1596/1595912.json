With Cherifa Kersit (1967), the 'Cheikha' - the grande dame - of the singing tradition of the Berbers from the Moroccan Middle Atlas Mountains and guitarist Niño Josele (1974), protégé of Paco de Lucía, a descendant of a gipsy dynasty from the South Spanish Almería. The flamenco guitar mingles with the lotar, the Berber lute; and the raw Berber songs alternate with the \"Cante Jondo\", deep flamenco song. Together they built musical bridges, or rather, restored the old connections across the Strait of Gibraltar.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":282786,"logo_path":null,"name":"NPSradio","origin_country":""},{"id":282787,"logo_path":null,"name":"the Dutch Flamenco Biënnale","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maghreb Flamenco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niño Josele","original_name":"Niño Josele","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6938fda7f634e87ab8f879ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5868187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cherifa Kersit","original_name":"Cherifa Kersit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6938fdb638e89295c9f87aa7","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
