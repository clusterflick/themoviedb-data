A journalist leaves his reporting station just minutes before his live broadcast, to go to the restroom. In the long queue of impatient people, the war is discussed by those waiting in line. Some praise the photographer, while others criticize him for not covering a particular incident or for not being at a certain location during a specific event. The photographer’s tense state and need to use the restroom continue to rise until he reluctantly returns to the live broadcast to cover an ongoing massacre. The story is humorous and painful, capturing the often-overlooked, quotidian struggles of refugees surviving amidst a genocide.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zGIUX6y1EPIG68hzfFBqgXkCyEG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2025-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live Broadcast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5866102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emad Badwan","original_name":"Emad Badwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6937a575a5ab6d1e46f87317","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"Gaza Biennale","release_date":"2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
