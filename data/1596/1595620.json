A simple coin toss exposes the desperate attempt to crave connection and attention, even when the means to attain it is ambiguous.  What begins as small talk develops into a tense yet humorous exchange, as each man projects his own loneliness, frustrations, and longing for attention onto the other. Inspired by WangKarWai, using the script of the Coen brothers’ iconic coin-toss scene, this short film transforms a moment of chance into a portrait of two mismatched souls briefly sharing the same cramped space, before retreating back into their separate lives, unseen and unresolved.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pNjCruinMAEha4RKkekxacGrjUc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coin Toss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pNjCruinMAEha4RKkekxacGrjUc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
