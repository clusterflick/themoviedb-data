Along with their dachshund, Murphy, they begin their journey at the French-Spanish border. For days, they walk backward through rolling meadows, sun-drenched forests, and high, cold mountains.  The world doesn't come to them, but moves away from them. This perspective casts the journey to Santiago in a completely new light. One of transience, beauty, and presence. After 50 days, they arrive at Santiago de Compostela. The unknown is no longer something unknown, but an invitation to slow down.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Backwards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
