He reveals widespread radiation contamination threatening millions through polluted water sources and buried toxic ruins. The film also connects Chernobyl to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, when the plant was seized, staff were abducted, and Russian troops exposed themselves to deadly radiation. It portrays Chernobyl as an ongoing environmental and geopolitical time bomb.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eVmzAOHvwRCHf8rpNmt4oY1CIqM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131370,"logo_path":null,"name":"AESA Films","origin_country":""},{"id":175503,"logo_path":"/tT7XQvsrurBxHcgdU1TUMKfTrZu.png","name":"APL Film","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2024-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A contamination expert uncovers the lasting environmental and health impacts of the Chernobyl nuclear fallout","title":"Chernobyl A Bomb That Keeps Ticking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Dobrovolsky","original_name":"Allen Dobrovolsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6937d30a1863489cb2069b4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629853,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paddy Payne","original_name":"Paddy Payne","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6937d39b1396fd0a59aeff64","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27817705","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.784,"height":816,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/crptwfxRQkwffPebpIW32iKY4HG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1456}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eVmzAOHvwRCHf8rpNmt4oY1CIqM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CHERNOBYL: A BOMB THAT KEEPS TICKING Trailer","key":"910580272","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-06T21:09:26.000Z","id":"6937d56b0c198b9563f872f0"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Chernobyl - A Bomb That Keeps Ticking' - documentary trailer","key":"96GzhF-oqqQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-18T12:57:19.000Z","id":"6937d4ff27877a4d6e7fc5e4"}]}}}
