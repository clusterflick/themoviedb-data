In the hope of offering the final apology he never had the chance to make, he enlists a witch to help conjure Andre’s ghost in a blood ritual. He will return in physical form, but there’s a catch: he will only get to stay for one night until daylight.  When Andre manifests, he is in no mood to stick around to hear what Terrance has to say. Instead, he flees to his favourite club, with his grieving, guilt-ridden friend in hot pursuit, desperate to find him before sunrise. Unsuccessful in his search, Terrance returns home to discover Andre waiting for him, ready to talk.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6PNvvzMQlm5bO8Fu8GIMR3covov.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Best Friend, Andre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2602027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Li","original_name":"Sebastian Li","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6938b1c2bd6c572e6e134bec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Cotter","original_name":"Billy Cotter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6938b1cd26243149767fcac0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aarti Vincent","original_name":"Aarti Vincent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6938b1e0b3873b18f0f876c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5867884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Sims","original_name":"Eddie Sims","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6938b1f3880d4e8f2af8773f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dylan Do","original_name":"Dylan Do","popularity":0.0318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6938b148d51e6f7242f87712","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dylan Do","original_name":"Dylan Do","popularity":0.0318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6938b173e8490634d0069ee4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990209,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Saraid Hounihan","original_name":"Saraid Hounihan","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6938b17e6eda4edebc3cea38","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1474,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6PNvvzMQlm5bO8Fu8GIMR3covov.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":972}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
