It includes live‑event footage of sets, performances and crowd energy — but its heart lies backstage, through interviews with many pioneering figures of jungle and drum & bass music: veteran DJs and MCs such as Jumping Jack Frost, Ragga Twins, Kenny Ken, MC Shabba D, among others.  Through their testimonies, the film reflects on what jungle has meant over two decades: why it endured, how it shaped communities, and what spirit — soul, unity, and culture — continues to drive it forward","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"20 YEARS OF JUNGLE MANIA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
