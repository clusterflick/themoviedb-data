From Repentigny to Tatooine, by way of the CHUM (Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal), the Super C (a supermarket), and New York, Christophe rarely makes the right choices, doesn't really take care of himself, but struggles as best he can to find his way between money and inspiration, between illness and pleasure, between love and death.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88623,"logo_path":"/yuGgqKQz3mVgqLn4nokSGcmeAUA.png","name":"Voyelles Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ce qu’on respire sur Tatouine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Carrière","original_name":"Louis Carrière","popularity":0.2293,"profile_path":"/b7x8Nl8cMe5Z3zLIRtou419mgWz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"693852517be86180da1349f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2339782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amaryllis Tremblay","original_name":"Amaryllis Tremblay","popularity":0.2238,"profile_path":"/boXY0sXVuwLxwESxhLv56zvhZ6O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6938525ee8490634d0069d0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1434840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Brunet","original_name":"Catherine Brunet","popularity":0.4474,"profile_path":"/yK2Q6conYIgMgBSprFHDtcpwWJB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"69385266194151237b069e1c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":949395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Crête","original_name":"Stéphane Crête","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/g6or3Es9GnZrxwsPijtEVzmqHgq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6938526f86253b4739aeffb5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Jeudy-Lamour","original_name":"Moe Jeudy-Lamour","popularity":0.3453,"profile_path":"/lrBIhtKkzzglwAMZRxEd8BCEzNl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6938527719f8104c70134a66","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Lagarde","original_name":"Ian Lagarde","popularity":1.1455,"profile_path":"/exZiNSSOvWxAtABF5doHKxzcaFk.jpg","credit_id":"693851ffe34b83875b6385bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Lagarde","original_name":"Ian Lagarde","popularity":1.1455,"profile_path":"/exZiNSSOvWxAtABF5doHKxzcaFk.jpg","credit_id":"693852057c53c9e550f7cf67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Christophe Réhel","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Réhel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69385219fba8170955f87693","department":"Writing","job":"Book"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
