The political activism of this generation came to a head in June 1987 with major protests that forced the authoritarian government to hold universal suffrage elections and implement key democratic reforms. Over 35 years later, the filmmaker reflects on the state of this democracy through a warm-hearted family portrait set against the backdrop of the country’s recent history. Using a personal and intimate cinematic style, Arum examines her father's adherence to conventionality as a high-ranking civil servant and her mother's fervent enthusiasm as a feminist activist. In the midst of these two contrasting dynamics, Arum seeks to discover her own role and how she can contribute to social change.","popularity":0.488,"poster_path":"/8WMA5tlK2FrraRzWpMuJ1EXUYI4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2025-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Feminist mom ♥ Bureaucrat dad = ?","title":"K-Family Affairs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"南韓民主家政課","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4236692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam A-rum","original_name":"Nam A-rum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eaf52683901800af818704","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34869559","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"k_family_affairs","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":912,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5LZ0vlUNx6QdD9sX9K6prnxhzoc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1620}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1808,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8WMA5tlK2FrraRzWpMuJ1EXUYI4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1205},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1248,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tksScZ7OVBInjbv73vsdveEAel6.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":870},{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":1038,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cf3VtzykprkgcbohhHRwBX6rJZl.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2490,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f3adYx3EPa601QtPEMl17fcfeK8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1660},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1795,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u2sqyn0cEDRJjRBM3bqEZzDiXH0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1205},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/cLg9Pc0Jj6XlizxpVKafY6OibpD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1447}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":250707,"name":"sewol"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Montreal International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2023-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"I","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam","release_date":"2024-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
