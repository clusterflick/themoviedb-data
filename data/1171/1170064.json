Captivating through its footage of lush, old-growth forests—a reminder of what’s at stake—this documentary from director Nance Ackerman offers a considered model for scientists working alongside Indigenous communities to prevent ecological catastrophe. It also prudently differentiates between the interference and involvement of humans in nature’s healing.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Quiet and the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nance Ackerman","original_name":"Nance Ackerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea513dc613ce00c9f25647","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nance Ackerman","original_name":"Nance Ackerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea514b1feac1011b2de97a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nance Ackerman","original_name":"Nance Ackerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea517145819900e3531bf9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nance Ackerman","original_name":"Nance Ackerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea517f5258ae00eaa49dd8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teresa MacInnes","original_name":"Teresa MacInnes","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/7IPcQyiOQTaOPDH0NgSFVxaEYQl.jpg","credit_id":"64ea515c5258ae010bd9e7c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
