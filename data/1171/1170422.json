This documentary, produced by Radiotelevisión de Veracruz, exposes this situation through testimonies of family members and friends of victims of homophobia, as well as collectives and activists who fight against violence against the LGBT community, and specialist researchers on the subject. Likewise, this journalistic report seeks to make society aware of this problem and to call for an end to violence against people because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/79JNDa0b0vrfnSpUlqWkdIxDRO0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detrás del arcoíris no siempre hay un tesoro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Garizurieta","original_name":"Hugo Garizurieta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eb767e594c94011c374835","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Garizurieta","original_name":"Hugo Garizurieta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eb7684839018011f8e033a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Jimenez","original_name":"Emmanuel Jimenez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eb7672e894a6013bb15d0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/79JNDa0b0vrfnSpUlqWkdIxDRO0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
