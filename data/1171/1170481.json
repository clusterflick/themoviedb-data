Don Rafa","overview":"Don Rafa is almost illiterate, he lives in a marginal area of a municipality surrounding the city of Xalapa, in the high mountains of the state of Veracruz, in Mexico. He survives day to day as part of an economic activity considered by the bulk of the population as \"poor people's work\", he might remotely know about the \"#MeToo\" movement, he might never have heard of Harvey Milk and his fight for gay rights or Alfred C. Kinsey's pioneering research on human sexuality. Even so, Don Rafa is a particularly exceptional human being, whose philosophy of life is summed up in getting up every day to fight and overcome the blows of life with an enthusiasm and dignity that any of us would like. His worldview is so universal and so authentic that it could be lived simultaneously by any other human being in any part of Latin America or the world.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/xhlgPOf5Nbra2B9KDRGnedNHGw7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yo soy...
