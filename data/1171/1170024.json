Tyranny is not only practiced by the British colonials but equally facilitated by local traditional institutions--thus, the resultant suffering (Duka) of Peduru is a combination of the two.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A continuation of \"Bawa Duka\"","title":"Bawa Karma - භව කර්ම","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0964500","wikidata_id":"Q4873747","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
