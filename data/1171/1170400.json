The two opposing forces began to search for a way to end the grueling war of attrition, eventually settling on a modest village called ‘Pan Mun Jom’ near Gaeseong as the designated site for negotiations. Despite initial hopes for a quick resolution, the negotiating parties encountered obstacles that prevented an agreement. Disputes over the military demarcation line and the repatriation of prisoners of war thwarted their efforts. The film peels back the layers to reveal the untold story of Pan Mun Jom, shedding light on a history that has remained hidden until now.","popularity":0.3537,"poster_path":"/luRsfOGMxSTTgXIK6YI4QFSWxu5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112196,"logo_path":"/t7iLYzrj825rY7CqEG7xS4IUOOB.png","name":"Newstapa","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Front Line of Ideology","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"PAN MUN JOM, You have never seen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pan Mun Jom","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Hae-il","original_name":"박해일","popularity":0.5771,"profile_path":"/nH84jrSFzsMomNGdtwz6QGE8M2I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"664ee7bd57f21fa765cae132","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2305319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Song Won-geun","original_name":"Song Won-geun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eb6acb1feac10138db5ef2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jang Kwang-yun","original_name":"Jang Kwang-yun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66547a00e4a1e3dd189b783e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2305319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Song Won-geun","original_name":"Song Won-geun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e42be0ec98bf0a0d761d67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716322,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Choi Hyoung-seok","original_name":"Choi Hyoung-seok","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e42c03cd4c4a62d0dc4bf5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3XpDV1iP0tlc4mPZwxlhhojnoMx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/luRsfOGMxSTTgXIK6YI4QFSWxu5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3264,"name":"korean war (1950-53)"},{"id":244029,"name":"dmz"},{"id":267761,"name":"inter-korean relations"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2024-06-19","release_date":"2024-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
