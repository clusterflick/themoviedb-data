One of the most impoverished sectors among railway workers, they had no previous experience with striking or organized struggle. How did they pull such a victory ? Their dermination to fight was undoubtedly the key to winning, but so are the links they forged with revolutionary activists who brought with them a tradition of fighting for workers against employers.","popularity":0.165,"poster_path":"/u2JT9BsLFykU7dGW3QMpZskmvD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Communard.e.s","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les petites mains invisibles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1187,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u2JT9BsLFykU7dGW3QMpZskmvD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":835}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2346,"name":"worker"},{"id":4112,"name":"strike"},{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
