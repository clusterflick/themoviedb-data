Regrettably, this transformation also reveals a harrowing story: for the past five decades, hundreds of shoemakers have worked tirelessly for up to 18 hours a day, making shoes for wages below the minimum standard. Each day, these workers leave their homes for work, not knowing if it will mark their final day in this relentless cycle.","popularity":0.1134,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112196,"logo_path":"/t7iLYzrj825rY7CqEG7xS4IUOOB.png","name":"Newstapa","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mun Jeong-hyun","original_name":"문정현","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5kfICXhhElFPAZJ9gGOvTWX640n.jpg","credit_id":"66bdac756680904c1b403005","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":290327,"name":"seoul, south korea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
