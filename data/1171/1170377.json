In this space, which is as much a living room as it is an archive, they share their life stories with each other. The short film is a hopeful, imaginative documentary about reclaiming spaces where the identity of older LGBTQ+ individuals is not accepted. It gives an insight into the LGBTQ+ history of Rotterdam through the stories of four elderly people: lesbian activist Nell Broekhuizen, trans man Jos Niesing and married couple Tonny van Dijk, a heterosexual woman, and Arie van Dijk, a gay man. Although the stories of the four main characters seem very different at first glance, they clearly have one thing in common. Nell, Jos, Tonny and Arie have all had to search for a space in which they could be themselves. All four have had to transform traditional norms around family, faith and marriage to find space for their identity.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/sm5sqj2qD7xad2q9knVX1m9690u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over Roze Gesproken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nell Broekhuizen","original_name":"Nell Broekhuizen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64eb5d4983901800af81a373","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jos Niesing","original_name":"Jos Niesing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64eb5d50c3c891011d9f8847","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arie van Dijk","original_name":"Arie van Dijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64eb5d595258ae012ca5f15c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonny van Dijk","original_name":"Tonny van Dijk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64eb5d5fc5c1ef00ad3e3a29","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4237255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Maria","original_name":"Charlotte Maria","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eb5d2f06f984012d737fe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28615984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/sm5sqj2qD7xad2q9knVX1m9690u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
