So he made the life-changing decision to commit his whole being to something meaningful.  Light after Dark takes us into the world of this prominent Australian artist. With intimate access, we peel away the layers of anxiety, phobias and suicide survival, whilst embracing the humour, energy, and love that is ever-present in the Bromley world. David’s journey is not complete without his wife Yuge and it’s through this powerful partnership that we witness firsthand the fragility of David’s world and state of mind. As the Bromley’s live their authentic lives, interviews with friends, critics and musicians add perspectives and insight on creative process, mental health, and commercialisation of art.","popularity":0.09,"poster_path":"/lFtczo1JAMmbLlUlfDs2ZAYNATj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathartic Pictures (AU)","origin_country":""},{"id":207223,"logo_path":null,"name":"12:01 Productions (AU)","origin_country":""},{"id":21592,"logo_path":"/tjqSDOrtxKLKHKtGe7f5tL4226k.png","name":"Madman Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bromley: Light After Dark","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4238494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bromley","original_name":"David Bromley","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64ebf7065258ae00c94d3fc6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4238495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean McDonald","original_name":"Sean McDonald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebf79c5258ae00eaa522d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574080,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Clare Plueckhahn","original_name":"Clare Plueckhahn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebf7bbc5c1ef010286c35c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2523504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cathy Rodda","original_name":"Cathy Rodda","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebf7d506f984012d73a85e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363928,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Delaney Murphy","original_name":"Delaney Murphy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebf8abd48cee00e371d5cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1516071,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sara Edwards","original_name":"Sara Edwards","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebf8c106f98400ae4a07fb","department":"Editing","job":"Supervising Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Batterham","original_name":"Nick Batterham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebf8d845819900adaa10ae","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Batterham","original_name":"Nick Batterham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebf8f5c3c891013ab31319","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28289616","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1296,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lFtczo1JAMmbLlUlfDs2ZAYNATj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":864},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1296,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wBfgLCDHdXkB5jutFW4UO8OU1cJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":864},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p9l4hyIpKCgwbhhhsivkRKjw4ph.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinefest Oz Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bromley: Light After Dark - Official Trailer","key":"jsqsiznYz2Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-09-13T23:30:08.000Z","id":"65026d36d7dcd200acb146f3"}]}}}
