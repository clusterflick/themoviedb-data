This is a film that was born under the wing of multidisciplinary artistic days united in the concept \"Bobe Al Camp Troupe\". Under that name, hours of artistic discussion took place between Bobe himself, his brother Andrés -the former musician of \"La Ley\"-, Álvaro Henríquez, Javiera Parra, Candy Dubois, and many other representatives of the bohemian and Santiago artistic spree of late from the '80s, who also participate in the film's soundtrack.","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":"/4Fkd8Dwj8kFnE9GB6g4xDUu9CmW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moizefala, la desdichada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4239708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moisés Ammache","original_name":"Moisés Ammache","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64ece60945819900adaa7199","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169433,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Álvaro Henríquez","original_name":"Álvaro Henríquez","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64ece616594c9400ffe7857a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2077115,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Marcela Zamorano","original_name":"Marcela Zamorano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64ece621839018013cdbbe6c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4239709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candy Dubois","original_name":"Candy Dubois","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64ece62c458199011d2c2bf8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4115775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Bobe","original_name":"Germán Bobe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ece5ebc613ce00ac42e161","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Fkd8Dwj8kFnE9GB6g4xDUu9CmW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
