She travels from Scotland back to her childhood home - to the garden where she once had nightmares of the conflict. Now it's blossoming with fruit trees that her father grows, acting as the conversational middle ground for the deeper problems of the relationship. As the debates about power dynamics in the house and on the island grow in parallel, she needs to understand her father's experiences and find the courage to tell him that she always sought his validation. Meray felt oppressed by her father and the state in north Cyprus, and finally wants to express herself within her family, and the Cyprus that she once escaped.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/5ZICec2Nh2Kh6y34lFECc6IgeLw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97989,"logo_path":"/zsVfzGovuswYjPQAzS2WjA9XhFk.png","name":"Scottish Documentary Institute","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Moon","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4238229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meray Diner","original_name":"Meray Diner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66884d90eae5497872791359","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4238229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meray Diner","original_name":"Meray Diner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ebb5fac5c1ef00c652a728","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ZICec2Nh2Kh6y34lFECc6IgeLw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Edinburgh International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
