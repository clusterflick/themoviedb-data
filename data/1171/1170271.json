The older priest is known as ‘Father Gang’, symbolizing his fight against corrupt authority. The younger priest, on the other hand, is known as ‘Father Red’ for his advocacy of Korean reunification and for crossing the armistice line. These two figures were pivotal in challenging Park Chunghee's authoritarian regime, participating in the pro-democracy movement against military rule, advocating Lim Sukyung's visit to North Korea, protesting against U.S. military bases, addressing the Yongsan disaster, and standing up against the Jeju Gangjeong village incident. Their church provided solace to the vulnerable and marginalized.","popularity":0.1708,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112196,"logo_path":"/t7iLYzrj825rY7CqEG7xS4IUOOB.png","name":"Newstapa","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father, Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4236812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Gyu-hyun","original_name":"Moon Gyu-hyun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64eb05cb1feac100c46f52b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4236813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Jeong-hyun","original_name":"Moon Jeong-hyun","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64eb05d606f98400eb60804c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1117877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lim Su-kyung","original_name":"Lim Su-kyung","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64eb05ad1feac100e16b005b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4236818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baek Gi-wan","original_name":"Baek Gi-wan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64eb05fde894a600c7294279","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4236800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Jung-nam","original_name":"Park Jung-nam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eb05605258ae00add54ac5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":172391,"name":"catholic priest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
