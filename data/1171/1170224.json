The Cheetahs topped the K-league in 2000 but suddenly relocated to Seoul in 2003. Having no team to support, RED had no reason to continue its existence. But rather than accepting defeat, the die-hard members of RED began a fierce, nine-year struggle that finally led to the birth of Anyang’s own football club once again. FC Sukhavati  is the story of these football otakus and their home city, of their growth, solidarity and victory.","popularity":0.0633,"poster_path":"/mDqq5rrUVvLNAid5SQma0SDtXVx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239671,"logo_path":"/tZ6YNDv6AVVFNCm8iemRHBhpdiD.png","name":"Cinema
