It uses the historic site of Coney Island as a point of departure from which to explore both the hopes and failed dreams of those who left their native lands to start a new life in America. Optically printed images of contemporary Coney Island are juxtaposed against the voices of immigrants describing their varied yet shared experiences. Intertitles serve to stitch together two parallel themes: that the heyday of Coney Island and the heyday of immigration to America occurred simultaneously, and that the two had both a subtle and lasting impact on each other.\" - Mary Patierno","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/e7qxFD2slv8GtJbv60YfumTEj90.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sodom By the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harriet Hirshorn","original_name":"Harriet Hirshorn","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ed3b19e2bca800e23483d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Patierno","original_name":"Mary Patierno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ed3b2506f98400ae4a818e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7qxFD2slv8GtJbv60YfumTEj90.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
