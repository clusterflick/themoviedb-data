Idea is personified as a beautiful young lady, free of all bondage. The two men try to justify their claim over their Idea through their forms of art.  Unable to settle the conflict, the two men approach ‘Fate’, personified as a big fat man of authority, to judge their claims. They soon realize that Idea is no one’s possession and it isn’t wise to rely on ‘Fate’ for a judgement. They decide to bury their ‘Fate’, and settle the matter in peace. Idea, portrayed as a free spirit, gets impressed by a kid who resides in an alternate world of fantasy, and decides to venture into the new creative world. The real world, with all its materialistic obsessions, rigid notions and prejudices, loses the Idea forever.","popularity":0.0625,"poster_path":"/hghy57tZTtKC9ojwojrMInJZSaA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Swastik Arthouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Oriya","iso_639_1":"or","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khyanikaa: The Lost Idea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amrita Choudhury","original_name":"Amrita Choudhury","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Idea","credit_id":"5edce7548d52c90027a6731b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susant Misra","original_name":"Susant Misra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lazy Man","credit_id":"5edce766f36a32002088b236","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256902,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Swastik Choudhury","original_name":"Swastik Choudhury","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"British","credit_id":"5edce7779c24fc002268556b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choudhury Bikash Das","original_name":"Choudhury Bikash Das","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/qfX1byzxaWB75nIkfZytcBTtS8n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mad Man","credit_id":"5edce78c1dcb7700200466a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hrushikesh Bhoi","original_name":"Hrushikesh Bhoi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fate","credit_id":"5edce79cb42242002292f194","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5edce8019c24fc00236846f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5edce7d59c24fc00236846be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5edce7f59c24fc002268572f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5edce7e8f36a32001d8a9735","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256903,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kisaloy Roy","original_name":"Kisaloy Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edce80e9c24fc0022685745","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5926914","wikidata_id":"Q48734586","facebook_id":"TheLostIdea","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2654,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hghy57tZTtKC9ojwojrMInJZSaA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1872}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"UA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Oriya\", \"english_name\"=>\"Oriya\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"or\", \"native_name\"=>\"Oriya\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Khyanikaa - The Lost Idea (TRAILER)","key":"9NiEYZeHZsE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-05-13T13:58:59.000Z","id":"5edce8d21dcb77002004693e"}]}}}
