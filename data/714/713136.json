In the heavens, the clouds blend with the smoke that flows incessantly. This is the start and also the end point for this visual essay, exploring the rhythmic, associative and sensory potentialities of glitch and digital imagery to address the dichotomies between aesthetics and politics, abstraction and figuration, contemplation and thought. At the limit, the film questions how easly the abstract landscapes of the intellect make us lose touch with the concrete reality and our senses of action.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7f7IxKdpllKNPPKiuhg5sO7OvMV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Véspera Visual Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2018-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Factory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2668305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muriel Paraboni","original_name":"Muriel Paraboni","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/wbXlLqRBpadkhg60rgtx7otjfzc.jpg","credit_id":"5edbee74726fb1001f867a38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fDsbmukSR76rQQn31TQi6IFK7pO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7f7IxKdpllKNPPKiuhg5sO7OvMV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CODEC - International Experimental Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2018-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Istanbul International Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2020-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE FACTORY | 2018 - Teaser-Trailer | EN","key":"265435849","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-18T18:29:19.000Z","id":"5edbeeb38d52c90021a33427"}]}}}
