Over a few intense months, these choreographers, including the first black artist to have won a Tony for choreography and a 92-year old former dance partner of pioneer Martha Graham, brought to life their ideas and sparked immense joy in the senior dancers. The film documents this unlikely event and, in the process, reveals the heroic dedication and determination of the choreographers and dancers, for whom age does not impede but molds.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817861,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Will Kitchings","original_name":"Will Kitchings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a3f32e9da690037eb3f52","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josefina Rotman Lyons","original_name":"Josefina Rotman Lyons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a3f1c3af929003a4f1f6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817863,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Will Kitchings","original_name":"Will Kitchings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a3f3fa14bef0036b80938","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josefina Rotman Lyons","original_name":"Josefina Rotman Lyons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a3ec023851300353e8f38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"deadCenter Film Festival","release_date":"2020-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
