They swim with sharks, confront venomous snakes, and stalk hungry lions. They're National Geographic filmmakers, and for these remarkable adventurers, capturing unforgettable footage in the wild is not just a job, it's a way of life. Join a cinematographer in the rain forest canopy as he goes to incredible lengths - and heights - to film the world's most powerful bird of prey. Witness the frustration of a filmmaker who just misses the scene-stealing shot of jackal pups greeting their mother in the Serengeti, and feel the exhilaration when he finally captures the event to perfection. Meet the talented professionals who go behind the camera every day and sometimes risk their lives to bring us extraordinary images of nature's most amazing creatures.","popularity":1.5077,"poster_path":"/yfoW7f7skeN867G0rYi0XpQTUw3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic: The Filmmakers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Filmmakers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Pengra","original_name":"Michael Pengra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5edf9ca9f36a32001d8ee878","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Breder","original_name":"John Breder","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5edfac3cb42242002298bbd9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Burns","original_name":"Stephen Burns","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5edfaca4f36a32001d8efe88","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Clark","original_name":"David Clark","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5edfacd16b5fc20020c5df14","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395277,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George D.
