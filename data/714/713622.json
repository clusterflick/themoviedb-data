There is a police raid in yet another gay bar in Greenwich Village.  Tired of being persecuted, Stonewall's customers do not give way. This rebellion constitutes a founding moment from which the movement for LGBTQ rights federates and organizes itself politically, which will give birth in 1970, to the first pride march, or Gay Pride. On the occasion of its 50th anniversary , this documentary looks back at its origins by exploring the Stonewall rebellion through intimate accounts of witnesses and activists whose lives were turned upside down by the birth of this movement.","popularity":0.0685,"poster_path":"/ejhixWLMN75dtpKKKJqyphk9xH5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stonewall: Paving the Way to Gay Pride","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathilde Fassin","original_name":"Mathilde Fassin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gwrLV1zafOPGBQc2OR9tYeo4elH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Director","credit_id":"62e866c6308131005d20542e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathilde Fassin","original_name":"Mathilde Fassin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gwrLV1zafOPGBQc2OR9tYeo4elH.jpg","credit_id":"5ede13ef9c24fc00226a76c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13405210","wikidata_id":"Q112747526","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3pD03HeO0ChjRXdQRGXH2EX5I3m.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wGc67NcEH7sf9vzNMAs6mazUqzL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/f37DdSB1faF1hc8gofQXdUS2ZlB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oCNfpR7pc4R5XQzB3agBl8wJGvf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ejhixWLMN75dtpKKKJqyphk9xH5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/g0hjx4KYzahV5Yyb6WPHJIpNsM8.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":885,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/s1quTk2A5FhXHXxt8Zk4QVGRx7U.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":602},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":883,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i88uY8nyZSwAzZdiOpqMpEqhseO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/qZT25ymDO8cKSFxVykpvNsTASsn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
