In order to receive a diagnosis from American doctors, the composer embarks on a journey from Europe to America aboard a legendary Soviet cruise ship. The origins of his illness take us into the past, and everything snowballs from here: from breaking up with his wife to a denunciation of him by his cast-off lover; from an orchestra withdrawing to rehearse a new symphony, to an unexpected call from Stalin. The symphony will be performed, but at what cost?","popularity":0.1611,"poster_path":"/toKI7nrjcQRvZXIGyvyXS5v8s4M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Shostakovich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Uchitel","original_name":"Алексей Учитель","popularity":0.1411,"profile_path":"/21R8GMkntVJOO5fMYPXY9vGAz9A.jpg","credit_id":"5edbddd18d52c90027a48bd5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2452311,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Polina Demina","original_name":"Polina Demina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edbddc7f36a32002087b2f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/toKI7nrjcQRvZXIGyvyXS5v8s4M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
