Everyone is afraid of senility. We talk about old age not as a path through the clinic and oblivion in the cemetery, but as a bright period of life which has many advantages associated only with older age. This film is about people who know the reasons to live and what to do with their lives at any age. The characters of the film answer the main questions of younger people’s crises by their actions, fulfilling their evolutionary mission by giving young people faith in the future. The film doesn’t have a finished script, it’s a true story. We are filming in real-time. Each character has their own line, and time will tell how it will develop.","popularity":0.0827,"poster_path":"/kvpFwaysQWYi88fu7gSRU9i2RKh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135227,"logo_path":"/wv00iAcn952q7N7u3PQ8c0IaOEF.png","name":"Pervoe Kino Film Company","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deadline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Dedlayn","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Grigoryev","original_name":"Евгений Григорьев","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/kc13nHKwCyrS6qNo4MH1AibxHwX.jpg","credit_id":"634ec718a8b2ca007e4f6797","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3746385,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Boris Niklavis","original_name":"Boris Niklavis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634ec73f0745e1008999bd90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3746385,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Boris Niklavis","original_name":"Boris Niklavis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634ec749a8b2ca007e4f67a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2668414,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olga Erofeeva","original_name":"Olga Erofeeva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edc06031dcb77001f012965","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kvpFwaysQWYi88fu7gSRU9i2RKh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1hBXa7z804neNlI5uYhdlmFkTve.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beat Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lendoc Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
