It remained submerged until a few years ago, but a climate cycle of intense drought exposed the remains of a ghost town. In the fantasies of each protagonist, a common thread is being developed; they relate their own experiences and feelings that arise from what happened. In his illusions there is a look to the future. They maintain the hope that not everything has been lost and that Epecuén will resurface.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9fLfmevidNQVLEkj6LXH7G9YU07.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En los ojos de la memoria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2670813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Betiana Burgardt","original_name":"Betiana Burgardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede4cb1f1759c0020d3252b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3950142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1343,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fLfmevidNQVLEkj6LXH7G9YU07.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":950}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
