The result has been a widening epidemic of obesity-related health problems, including coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes. While discussions about this spiraling health crisis have tended to focus on the need for more exercise and individual responsibility, FEEDING FRENZY trains its focus squarely on the responsibility of the processed food industry and the outmoded government policies it benefits from. It lays bare how taxpayer subsidies designed to feed hungry Americans during the Great Depression have enabled the food industry to flood the market with a rising tide of cheap, addictive, high calorie food products, and offers an engrossing look at the tactics of the multi billion-dollar marketing machine charged with making sure that every one of those surplus calories is consumed.","popularity":0.138,"poster_path":"/jbCczajATMhEVAWMQEjW5bvsdbE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feeding Frenzy: The Food Industry, Obesity and the Creation of a Health Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raj Patel","original_name":"Raj Patel","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"619455b23f7e1d0090e9d060","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"619455c92faf4d00288d7c5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Nestle","original_name":"Marion Nestle","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/9SLKyTAHCHzY8OcNRgIHMtT2TnL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"self","credit_id":"619455dc9451e7005f7f97a4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Geis","original_name":"Kate Geis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619452e24da3d4008cbdd29e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312715,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kate Geis","original_name":"Kate Geis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6194532fefca0000441534af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Rideout","original_name":"Rebecca Rideout","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619453459d592c0091b6ea3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Geis","original_name":"Kate Geis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619453637e9d5f006443b87d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","credit_id":"65569e1967b61345cd3504b2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jbCczajATMhEVAWMQEjW5bvsdbE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
