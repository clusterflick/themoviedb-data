Upstairs, his daughter virtually reconfigures Peppa Pig.  Outside, meanwhile, hiding in the forest, is an unnamed, camouflaged fugitive, who explains her escape from a society that seems to have happily abolished the distinction between organic and technological life. An artist who has become a guerrilla fighter, the woman is busy preparing totem-like countermeasures to disrupt those who have become ‘animal expanded’.","popularity":0.0667,"poster_path":"/7tLfGkmRZeepntPuyIq8ywLLlS2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council England","origin_country":""},{"id":117399,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of the Arts London","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ANIMAL CONDENSED>>ANIMAL EXPANDED#2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Wagland","original_name":"John Wagland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Man","credit_id":"5ede502bf36a32001d8cfcfe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1468668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Edmundston","original_name":"Alison Edmundston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"5ede50449c24fc0020691d12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2670828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Wagland","original_name":"Alma Wagland","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"5ede5059b422420020944cf5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tarragó","original_name":"Paul Tarragó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"White Figure/Authenticity Fetish","credit_id":"5ede50a78d52c90022a84a45","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2670704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennet Thomas","original_name":"Jennet Thomas","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede2752f1759c0021d31d10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2670830,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Chadburn","original_name":"Leo Chadburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede50ca9c24fc00236a37d4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tarragó","original_name":"Paul Tarragó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede50f1b422420020944dd7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2670704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennet Thomas","original_name":"Jennet Thomas","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede51569c24fc00226ac04a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2670704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennet Thomas","original_name":"Jennet Thomas","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede51ea8d52c90022a84d9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2670704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennet Thomas","original_name":"Jennet Thomas","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede51cdf1759c0020d32815","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2670704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennet Thomas","original_name":"Jennet Thomas","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede51dcf36a32001d8cffa3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2670835,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Alejandro Escobar","original_name":"Alejandro Escobar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede51408d52c90022a84c3a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tarragó","original_name":"Paul Tarragó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ede51129c24fc00226ac012","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1009,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tLfGkmRZeepntPuyIq8ywLLlS2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
