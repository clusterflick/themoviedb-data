We know the story of Everest well after the tragic news stories and the IMAX film about it. There may be more technically difficult mountains to climb, but none have the mystique of Everest.  Above All Else is the story of Alan Hobson and Jamie Clarke's third and final attempt to scale the mountain. The two climbers, who had failed twice in 10 years to conquer Everest--once only 400 meters from the top--balance each other well; Clarke's surfer style is offset by Hobson's thoughtfulness.","popularity":0.178,"poster_path":"/QOt0HAxbQKZ90BJbiFCLO9F3Oh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Above All Else: The Everest Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186735,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jamie Clarke","original_name":"Jamie Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce73b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leigh Clarke","original_name":"Leigh Clarke","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce73f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186737,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alan Hobson","original_name":"Alan Hobson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce743","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Kirkby","original_name":"Bruce Kirkby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce747","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lhakpa Tsering","original_name":"Lhakpa Tsering","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce74b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leigh Clarke","original_name":"Leigh Clarke","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce75d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lhakpa Tsering","original_name":"Lhakpa Tsering","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce76f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186735,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jamie Clarke","original_name":"Jamie Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce757","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186739,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce Leitl","original_name":"Bruce Leitl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce775","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leigh Clarke","original_name":"Leigh Clarke","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Kirkby","original_name":"Bruce Kirkby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce769","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leigh Clarke","original_name":"Leigh Clarke","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce751","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186737,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alan Hobson","original_name":"Alan Hobson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce763","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186735,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jamie Clarke","original_name":"Jamie Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a368484e1ce77b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2381079","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/QOt0HAxbQKZ90BJbiFCLO9F3Oh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1008}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
