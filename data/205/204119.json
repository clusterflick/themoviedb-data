As Josef seeks to make an appointment to see the ruler Herr Klamm inside his inaccessible abode, he becomes enmeshed in abuse from lowly villagers and bureaucrats alike. His endless false starts toward the castle's enigmatic interior are partly offset by a few sexual encounters but nothing alleviates his role as a victim of forces beyond his control.","popularity":0.2163,"poster_path":"/5PuGOmfFpkcG5HPhjCaIjkjK3Ag.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skandia-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1986-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Linna","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The
