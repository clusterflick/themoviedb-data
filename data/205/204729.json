Trans-Dniestr) as a trip to a museum of communist totalitarianism. The country, whose independence has been recognized by only a few other states, remains an isolated multi-ethnic enclave held together by an authoritarian regime. In a country where you are only allowed to film out the window of a train, the locals are afraid of being denounced but are glad to live in a comfortable refuge from the hectic modern world, and songs on television celebrate the president.","popularity":0.0776,"poster_path":"/vc082ZbYLrERpBU6aC4GxJc1rri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20810,"logo_path":"/tpwYTOJvC650HgWoYBuYSBVDnON.png","name":"Nutprodukce","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech
