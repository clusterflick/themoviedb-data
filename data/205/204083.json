Inhabitants have given up their scientific and knowledge gathering initiatives and have instead resorted to mindless rampant consumerism &amp; corporatised servitude culminating in the terrible and mega-ultra-destructive \"Mighters March\". Super Silver Base Alpha has sent their top space agent, Bronco Cedar, to investigate the latest outbreak on Outpost 11. Now he's gone missing, so as a last resort they've sent Buck Fiesta, their B-list agent with an itchy trigger finger and a chronic case of sarcasim, to sort things out. Along the way he'll enlist help from Zen master teleporter, The Red Arrow, obtain vital information from Agent Unknown, and confront an army of Temporal Ninjas led by the sassy evil mastermind of icebox fusion, Dr. Spider Jones. It will take 2 times the action, 2 times the special effects, and 2 times the rock 'n' roll to win the day.","popularity":0.1334,"poster_path":"/t1pWvM9lko8lI6Oxn7ZbUUmnubD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock 'n' Roll Space Patrol Action Is Go!","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rock 'n' Roll Space Patrol Action Is Go!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Warren","original_name":"Alex Warren","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/gX2gm3KCyBAhWc7WViGY7jyhlyv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Buck Fiesta","credit_id":"52fe4cecc3a368484e1cd207","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Balsamo","original_name":"James Balsamo","popularity":0.1488,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6553b9480816c7011a0b059c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Bultas","original_name":"Jim Bultas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cecc3a368484e1cd203","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0762129","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1588,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1pWvM9lko8lI6Oxn7ZbUUmnubD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
