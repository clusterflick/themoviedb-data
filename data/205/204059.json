To cover their tracks and keep the old man from turning them in, the thieves pretend to arrange his comeback concert. The artifice becomes reality, the pianist makes a triumphant return, and the thieves reform. This 1938 film is not a remake of 1932's Stolen Heaven, which wove an entirely different story about a suicide pact.","popularity":0.6938,"poster_path":"/eUYEhG55jFy0Viqus5XCvOgvBNU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stolen Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Raymond","original_name":"Gene Raymond","popularity":0.2939,"profile_path":"/kCY8h8lNlh9GtQ0MtC32omMAj9k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Carl","credit_id":"52fe4cebc3a368484e1cd01d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olympe Bradna","original_name":"Olympe Bradna","popularity":0.1618,"profile_path":"/l9KGValr0X7Sq0zl7RU73HciKt1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Steffi","credit_id":"52fe4cebc3a368484e1cd021","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenda Farrell","original_name":"Glenda Farrell","popularity":0.2628,"profile_path":"/xBaAWMgCzVpzMzK2bmA8bkmSGm2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rita","credit_id":"52fe4cebc3a368484e1cd025","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Stone","original_name":"Lewis Stone","popularity":0.3048,"profile_path":"/wjIS8X6Smdbwb7CTQVyWelyZutk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Joseph Langauer","credit_id":"52fe4cebc3a368484e1cd029","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Porter Hall","original_name":"Porter Hall","popularity":0.45,"profile_path":"/249Hlfx23i69MsA3rLnC185kbwT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"'Von' Offer","credit_id":"52fe4cecc3a368484e1cd02d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglass Dumbrille","original_name":"Douglass Dumbrille","popularity":0.3535,"profile_path":"/quJC1FBvSzwNuFCQhlzXINXa7ZS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Klingman","credit_id":"52fe4cecc3a368484e1cd031","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Sawyer","original_name":"Joe Sawyer","popularity":0.4332,"profile_path":"/ct5dfzO05LnrJ4EBANBK2y8FPGN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bako","credit_id":"52fe4cecc3a368484e1cd035","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Dale","original_name":"Esther Dale","popularity":0.2417,"profile_path":"/veZ5vHbHOcslYXOUZFrYRn9O6mT.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lieschen","credit_id":"52fe4cecc3a368484e1cd039","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173748,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick J.
