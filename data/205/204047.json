Gloria, who runs the place, earns most of her money as a stripper. She lives there with her two daughters and a son with an untreated brain tumor. Charlie, who is forever in and out of jail, is Gloria's sometime lover. A recent check-in is there hoping she can work up the courage to commit suicide, since her rich doctor husband ran off and left her. Another resident is Tim, who keeps company with his dog and his booze in equal measure. A schoolteacher comes by from time to time, hoping to do these people some good, but in choosing this lot to work with, she proves to be just as much of a loser as the rest of them.","popularity":0.2754,"poster_path":"/aEcsFTcyFWuntQxieEkPPqPaBQ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":95795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Societe du Cinema du Quebec Maison de Quatres Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deaf to the City","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angèle Coutu","original_name":"Angèle Coutu","popularity":0.1522,"profile_path":"/6uK9duxtrAUcl0BMevpySyq02oq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"59d64d949251417f76012ff7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge","original_name":"Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge","popularity":0.2319,"profile_path":"/br69mhPG8XVHn35oMv2URN2JDX0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59d64d99c3a368324a011650","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Léger","original_name":"Sophie Léger","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/oIH5AZsHtVxiqg5u0XV6taosWYi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59d64d9e9251417f1801309d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1575482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Han Masson","original_name":"Han Masson","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/9DqTXwU2iAbvySTpBiKUh0TfS2f.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59d64da19251417f1e01376c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1156469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Picard","original_name":"Béatrice Picard","popularity":0.1823,"profile_path":"/wxhLxH5c1965meLE7LeA1LJmqBL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Florence","credit_id":"59d64da69251417f6e01382d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1665857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Thériault","original_name":"Pierre Thériault","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"5cb2cfed9251412fa326fbdf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mireille Dansereau","original_name":"Mireille Dansereau","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/ftKVuu6l6TJkTjfp4tPfUAlsQ1d.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cebc3a368484e1ccf99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133211","wikidata_id":"Q21281528","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEcsFTcyFWuntQxieEkPPqPaBQ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1987-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"1987-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
