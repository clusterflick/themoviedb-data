A mine in Scotland falls victim to a cave-in, trapping some one hundred workers. Rescue parties are formed as the tremulous families of the miners wait in agony. As in the actual incident upon which this film is based, the rescue is nip and tuck and times, but eventually successful. The faces of real-life Scottish mining folk are melded with the professional actors in The Brave Don't Cry, adding poignancy to this otherwise cut-and-dried film.","popularity":0.6087,"poster_path":"/msauxWirMJoQ4OXyoxiQBjCwV8I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Group 3
