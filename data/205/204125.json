The setting is changed to Spain, and Werther (Eusebio Poncela) has taken a job tutoring the son of an estranged husband and wife. The boy's mother is a surgeon and therefore a rather uncommon woman for her society. She and Werther gradually become romantically involved, and his feelings for her begin to run much deeper than is apparent on the surface.","popularity":0.2867,"poster_path":"/nrF1pOUPgUJ1lQMTCPY5xYdqnow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pilar Miró P.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1986-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Werther","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eusebio Poncela","original_name":"Eusebio Poncela","popularity":0.3226,"profile_path":"/pCbXRk44XYJzWDzYybAco5dlGF7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Werther","credit_id":"57161513c3a3682e65003624","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mercedes Sampietro","original_name":"Mercedes Sampietro","popularity":0.2983,"profile_path":"/5ZwykqdX9ClgABxC8d9VGSDW4kd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carlota","credit_id":"57161524c3a3682e65003629","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Féodor Atkine","original_name":"Féodor Atkine","popularity":0.3421,"profile_path":"/qCpSPJyM7v9p3fGBJV8ZqGETBr0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alberto","credit_id":"5716153492514146c80037d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicky Peña","original_name":"Vicky Peña","popularity":0.2755,"profile_path":"/xH6QQR5dd9pesS7hhxz9hMg1HB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Beatriz","credit_id":"57161547c3a3684122013b71","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Hostalot","original_name":"Luis Hostalot","popularity":0.2153,"profile_path":"/bVr1IeJ3nKtCPyr1y9NShW3TW9t.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jerusalén","credit_id":"57161557c3a3682e65003636","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Gutiérrez Caba","original_name":"Emilio Gutiérrez Caba","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/gCPju1eDQQOWFroZ3gI2ZVKhu1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Federico","credit_id":"571615649251412e52000730","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Arribas","original_name":"Miguel Arribas","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/pkWa3JV8fDUw87EHA27lK596BaH.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5716157592514146c80037db","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pilar Miró","original_name":"Pilar Miró","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/AiiScbcVeS6A9iL6EeZKhLU1elz.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cedc3a368484e1cd51d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jules Massenet","original_name":"Jules Massenet","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/fMB6VUi0gIcQEu3WBoP7G8rQMCD.jpg","credit_id":"5ecbd7006f6a99001f2920a3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092200","wikidata_id":"Q18611999","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/nrF1pOUPgUJ1lQMTCPY5xYdqnow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":820}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
