The visual point of departure is fashioned by découpages created by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, who is also the narrator. The découpages serve to establish the mood around the story of the children, Kaj and Gerda. They consist of a countless number of clippings, which are subsequently subjected to the processes of computer animation and mixed with graphics, live actors and music into an unique fairy tale universe.","popularity":0.2487,"poster_path":"/aGRXTD6rwpPoURRk9WZVqfnVgDW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15035,"logo_path":null,"name":"JJ Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Snow Queen","video":false,"vote_average":8.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Queen Margrethe II of Denmark","original_name":"Queen Margrethe II of Denmark","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":"/41SRlkN2XIuZHgb3dPxg9ilXJNp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1583","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":136773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronja Mannov Olesen","original_name":"Ronja Mannov Olesen","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/3cxn99mUanMIOo1UzajOK6IwUCv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gerda","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1587","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Elmelund","original_name":"Christian Elmelund","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kay","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d158b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathia Petersen","original_name":"Nathia Petersen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Gypsy Girl","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d158f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Knudsen","original_name":"Esther Knudsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Grandmother","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1593","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birthe Bøgelund","original_name":"Birthe Bøgelund","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1597","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Jørgensen","original_name":"Jacob Jørgensen","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/vbq7le9BMWMzTxkahtJ41XxIRo3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d159d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristof Kuncewicz","original_name":"Kristof Kuncewicz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d15a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0362160","wikidata_id":"Q33569030","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/aGRXTD6rwpPoURRk9WZVqfnVgDW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":509,"name":"denmark"},{"id":3205,"name":"fairy tale"},{"id":179411,"name":"based on fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
