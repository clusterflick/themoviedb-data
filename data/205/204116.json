Presented from the perspective of the young Pepe, the Civil War and Franco are irrelevant to his own concerns: daydreaming about a pretty girl he likes, fighting with other boys, helping the priest at a funeral service, and similar activities. Pepe lives with his uncle and grandparents, and whether he is aware of it or not, the war impinges on their lives in several ways. The title of the film derives from little Pepe's contention that God is not responsible for the war, just some \"bastard brother\" of the Creator.","popularity":0.1824,"poster_path":"/awvFYr7WoajIjZUq2SR2RYm68MH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Almadraba Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1986-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El hermano bastardo de Dios","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Rabal","original_name":"Francisco Rabal","popularity":0.7356,"profile_path":"/4SXneju54P5QjrF7ZmAlU09HHxX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5630a240c3a3681b4d0111bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asunción Balaguer","original_name":"Asunción Balaguer","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":"/eGtr4fI4ICrICF65BkmCesCqMSn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5630a24e9251414ab700d857","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liberto Rabal","original_name":"Liberto Rabal","popularity":0.1742,"profile_path":"/cxhE3tf2SNQatvX2Od7QzqKAsMo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5630a25b925141284c00f82f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agustín González","original_name":"Agustín González","popularity":0.3639,"profile_path":"/mZO2NuM7e7ftsutaiflgT20EM0G.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5630a269c3a3681b5900f45f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terele Pávez","original_name":"Terele Pávez","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/fXq6FkUXXehtT28LfRoI7fBJNej.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ramona","credit_id":"5a073da4925141077e002a54","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benito Rabal","original_name":"Benito Rabal","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cedc3a368484e1cd4eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0091196","wikidata_id":"Q37912667","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1550,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8JQvU4DomOrtkoIq8rQ3YffkOoC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1650,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/awvFYr7WoajIjZUq2SR2RYm68MH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1986-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
