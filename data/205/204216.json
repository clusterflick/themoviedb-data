Unwilling to dedicate herself to her husband, Malwa seeks out love from every man she meets. This results in a romantic triangle that is at once disarmingly simplistic and intensely dramatic. Malwa was the final directorial effort of Vladimir Braun, who died in 1957. Star Dzidra Ritenberga won a \"Best Actress\" award at the Venice Film Festival; co-stars Pavel Usovicenko and Anatoll Ighnaliev also earned praise for their realistic performances.","popularity":0.3473,"poster_path":"/gykFLvYZh8kCfFlMcS3NFvXNJns.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4581,"logo_path":"/p858ADU9O67a7ageVEjsk18jqak.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malva","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1274593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dzidra Ritenberga","original_name":"Dzidra Ritenberga","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/2ipparQkRAVT6Hw3b6TquPee3Aq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Malva","credit_id":"5a7f91b40e0a262aa90157e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoliy Ignatyev","original_name":"Анатолий Игнатьев","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/4ObB2Mara10nmI2iJcjZGuuqCYp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7f91bb0e0a262aac015df5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arkadi Tolbuzin","original_name":"Arkadi Tolbuzin","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/eYpXNzQRY2eXvHhZSKPZq60NnRt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7f91c40e0a262aac015dfc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arkadi Tolbuzin","original_name":"Arkadi Tolbuzin","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/eYpXNzQRY2eXvHhZSKPZq60NnRt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ignaty Fomich","credit_id":"5a7f91cb92514140f80137ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Usovnichenko","original_name":"Павел Усовниченко","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/84NM5p3Gsyyj2ekYikFbrxGdivV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7f91d2c3a36818b70135e5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gennadiy Yukhtin","original_name":"Геннадий Юхтин","popularity":0.2028,"profile_path":"/jf6ijlpiSJ3IYhyyQenwNsRa1md.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7f91dac3a36818a70151db","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":981203,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volodymyr Braun","original_name":"Volodymyr Braun","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ceec3a368484e1cd9f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nikolai Kovarsky","original_name":"Nikolai Kovarsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7f916b9251414101013c64","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1743542,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ihor Shamo","original_name":"Ihor Shamo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jWrYPurExEQG6YZqohk4aAJNru9.jpg","credit_id":"5f4d670e1684f700387305e6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0049466","wikidata_id":"Q3844024","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wgM3jj0zqTpP3YwyHKzHoIAUkDf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1588,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/gykFLvYZh8kCfFlMcS3NFvXNJns.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1058},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/zAQRJS7D14azC8TgYTtbYR5v2XP.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.559,"height":895,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/eBGpRw8c8Te9hQibiTQqDkY407H.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ou0w7zWE594eL7cKoMzcb4UHkJS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1956-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
