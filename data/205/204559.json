After Flep defeats another male fox to become Leila's lifelong partner, they mate and raise a litter of five kits. With their family complete, the group must contend with human interference in their habitat, such as chicken farms and snowmobiles, and struggle against the debilitating cold of winter. The animals experience both triumph and tragedy, as the law of this harsh land proves – only the strong survive.","popularity":0.5269,"poster_path":"/t69qrI7nMyGODhuTIqEgmFSLPlU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8487,"logo_path":"/bXWVZmW3RD6SAk0lFahPxNbp541.png","name":"Sanrio","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9118,"logo_path":"/9o6KLcDBRw3fNItUflJVwj8dZpC.png","name":"Samuel
