The story opens in Smelter City, Arizona, where the richest man in town is grizzled old Indian fighter Lafe Cantillon (Fred Stone). Lafe's social-climbing sister-in-law (Billie Burke) insists that her daughter Mary wed a titled European, Count Ferdinand (Francis Lederer). Much to Lafe's delight, Mary isn't assimilated into Continental high society; instead, she instructs Count Ferdinand in the virtues of good, old-fashioned American democracy. And, of, course, the Count and Lafe become great chums when the \"furriner\" proves that he can ride a bucking bronco with the best of 'em.","popularity":0.3285,"poster_path":"/65gT8kDZJ6fALfhkdgHFG6NQW3h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Count with American ideas...tries to trade his monocle for a lariat!","title":"My American Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Lederer","original_name":"Francis Lederer","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/jf2hWEynH4PbygMSp0hbXqAGJ8l.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Count Ferdinand von und zu Reidenach","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1543","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Sothern","original_name":"Ann Sothern","popularity":0.3724,"profile_path":"/oWjtae0NMfkrhuu0TuJCRvLcbre.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary Cantillon","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1547","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Stone","original_name":"Fred Stone","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/2RKZuRZHiMrFIySt6Vw4jvWervr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lafe Cantillon","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d154b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Burke","original_name":"Billie Burke","popularity":0.3591,"profile_path":"/gciSUzrGMI1BHDxiElw8KEcIOVW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Robert Cantillon","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d154f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Cossart","original_name":"Ernest Cossart","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/A3ZU9hvKmT26MdLb8VS2PxGacLo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Adolphe","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1553","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grant Mitchell","original_name":"Grant Mitchell","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/1jSSSQNl8sSYGWOPx0yJIBKpUrQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Robert Cantillon","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a368484e1d1557","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal K.
