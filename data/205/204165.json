The honor of conducting the orchestra seems like it will fall to Francesco (Michele Placido), the community's most well-established music teacher, and to insure his success, his ambitious wife starts sleeping with one of the organizers of the future concerts. Meanwhile, a disgruntled member of the organizing committee decides to muddy the waters by suggesting that another conductor (Andrea, a friend of Francesco's) be hired. Andrea is also a native son who went to the big city to find conducting work but ended up doing television jobs instead. When he receives the call about the prestigious job opportunity, he enthusiastically goes to the town but his wife refuses to join him.","popularity":0.2206,"poster_path":"/uLT7kh3UJt3nq39DMRtcr50ETLr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1982-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chopin","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Placido","original_name":"Michele Placido","popularity":0.7455,"profile_path":"/25eRAfm1kGE5kx2iBktONiTTWo8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Francesco Maria Vitale","credit_id":"67ef7b98ede8d82f3bad0669","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":224944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuliana De Sio","original_name":"Giuliana De Sio","popularity":0.2544,"profile_path":"/a5twdNN7UWsqSkjwuuwxF9BT38F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marta Vitale","credit_id":"67ef7baa8b1f32eb79d919e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adalberto Maria Merli","original_name":"Adalberto Maria Merli","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/ddHzQyehT2HKwkzV6hikjBjyvjM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Andrea Serano","credit_id":"67ef7bb7cbd55b661fd91d2c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tino Schirinzi","original_name":"Tino Schirinzi","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/pht1EDtYhjERYHDBZLtrIN2NTRU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nicolino","credit_id":"67ef7bc48b1f32eb79d91a08","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Traversa","original_name":"Fabio Traversa","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/bRx12WuNfkRP8eSXdz7Fma5CYrE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vittorio","credit_id":"67ef7bdd931ce174a2d924b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Uzzo","original_name":"Luigi Uzzo","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":"/vp3XBYBWPxFNwix9w4yrVZZJXWK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Giustino","credit_id":"67ef7c36cbd55b661fd91d45","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Consuelo Ferrara","original_name":"Consuelo Ferrara","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/f83nHq7PS9QnlaAwpTSyYZFPEEi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Marinella","credit_id":"67ef7c4348d6f031b0acf440","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Celano","original_name":"Guido Celano","popularity":0.2306,"profile_path":"/be0iL94WtrYbHUdCpw0cBJEVUzH.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Zio Cesarino","credit_id":"67ef7c51931ce174a2d924f5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Bonaiuto","original_name":"Anna Bonaiuto","popularity":0.284,"profile_path":"/1istMMsr34yfaYCnNyW8SFVMuU5.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Laura Serano","credit_id":"67ef7c5eede8d82f3bad06dd","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2885251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos De Matteis","original_name":"Carlos De Matteis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kSYxEPoLSyiPMs7V7C6OANrnMyp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sciopèn","credit_id":"67ef7c81cbd55b661fd91d4b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lino Troisi","original_name":"Lino Troisi","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/qG3bWqPTPMf23RufYtqyGKThHGA.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Avv.
