When German artist Bernd Hoffmann (Michael König) arrives in Lisbon to oversee the installation of his paintings in a joint exhibition with another Berlin artist, Hanna Brauer (Charlotte Schwab), Hanna never shows up. Hoffmann is puzzled because he is certain he saw a video sequence with Hanna at the exhibition, and he begins to look for her. Another Lisbon cultural center, a theater, is also having problems that may or may not be related -- and the mystery deepens when Hanna is found dead, either by her own hand, or murdered.","popularity":0.3597,"poster_path":"/ndeRaIwBPT2tQ6wBCVYoXFQ7JRx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18888,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du
