Ariana, an eight-year-old foster girl from the city of Sao Luis, Iban, an anthropologist of European origin who intends to make a documentary film, and Doña Eloisa, a native woman from Itamatatiua who works in ceramics. The members of this kind of family in transit find in common a feeling that binds them intimately: the feeling of loss. Ariana, Doña Eloisa and Iban have lived the experience of separation from their mothers. Human fragility will become the truth of their relationship, even more so after Sheyla's death.","popularity":0.3294,"poster_path":"/trvT5KrR3VSC9VVeFSa5XEQyxJm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117336,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moztu Filmak","origin_country":""},{"id":10115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonora Estudios","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stone, fish, river: Itamatatiua","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","original_name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Iban","credit_id":"6771edb07d1bc87de761815a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariana Sodré Damasceno","original_name":"Ariana Sodré Damasceno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ariana","credit_id":"6771ee025863b1e81912a777","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eloísa de Jesus","original_name":"Eloísa de Jesus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Doña Eloísa","credit_id":"6771eddc1f2c5d930192b426","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheyla de Jesus","original_name":"Sheyla de Jesus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sheyla","credit_id":"6771eded5863b1e81912a766","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Letícia Barbosa Lima","original_name":"Ana Letícia Barbosa Lima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6771edc07d1bc87de7618173","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","original_name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771ee4a5f1c4fa4736165e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","original_name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771ee5c5f1c4fa4736165ee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","original_name":"Iban Ayesta Aldanondo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771ee6c5f1c4fa473616600","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148350,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pako Ruiz","original_name":"Pako Ruiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771eea76cc4caf8fb92c90a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148352,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martín J.
