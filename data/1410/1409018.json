There are many countries in the world where they are oppressed and discriminated against both legally and illegally. Somos Libres!? (which is Spanish for 'Are we free?') tells the story of two young homosexuals who flee the repression of their native country to seek their freedom elsewhere. The main characters appear in various scenes that sound out their new-found freedom and are enacted in a humourous mixture of performance, theatre, music, and video techniques. Barcelona proves to be a big disappointment despite the fact that this harbour city has a traditional tolerance of homosexuals.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oFwShV3r5R511uriNnqzeaIyEMo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Are We Free?!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5146408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Ángel Cárdenas","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Cárdenas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6770a9196cc4caf8fb92a5b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/oFwShV3r5R511uriNnqzeaIyEMo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
