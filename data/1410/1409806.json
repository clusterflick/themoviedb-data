S.-bound disguised as entertainers. As entertainers they're flops, but evoke considerable mirth among the passengers by their efforts. Jack arouses the jealousy of a Frenchman, who is keen on a young French girl, and is challenged to a fight. The Frenchman fights a la Savatte (the French method, including kicking, bucking, etc.) and is getting the better of Jack, until the latter dons a pair of hobnailed brogans. He consents to remove these if his adversary will put boxing gloves on his feet. The Frenchman gets seasick and is counted out as he leans over the rail, where he is soon joined by Jack.","popularity":0.7014,"poster_path":"/ppRvJGeamPoIpSUEswgZQIYfLjm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All's Swell on the Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fight and Win #5: All's Swell on the Ocean","type":"Series title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Dempsey","original_name":"Jack Dempsey","popularity":0.4781,"profile_path":"/xUdUJOvHhjJPoKl0j6a3xOmBID3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tiger Jack O'Day","credit_id":"6772f86798f2f82fc4927dc5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Ralston","original_name":"Esther Ralston","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/1QFncrZpSppxeYKVByF4Jl8w9Xc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Holly Malloy","credit_id":"6772f87498f2f82fc4927dc9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayden Stevenson","original_name":"Hayden Stevenson","popularity":0.2531,"profile_path":"/wTK7268u3kpQKcxW9gbWzisKfXw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Society Sullivan","credit_id":"6772f87f5b8f422b60128b03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ovey","original_name":"George Ovey","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/6is2ebdbjrQzsoksjFyUWZcijJL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ed Martin -
