It is no coincidence that the documentary opens with the now distant, evocative images of the first event held in Italy (it was 1980) in which, in the public square, men and women were provocatively married. Plus: interviews at the PD party with Bersani, Bindi, and D'Alema, with some militants during a demonstration, with participants in the Turin and Viareggio parades, the testimonies of two couples (one gay and one lesbian), and speeches by Don Gallo and Paola Concia.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vxpsVHpqBOUVxQsHNEu2ibz0MVj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vorrei Ma Non Posso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Andrea Gallo","original_name":"Don Andrea Gallo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6770e871005810c23f928097","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5146796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donatella Rossi","original_name":"Donatella Rossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6770e87f005810c23f9280a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5146797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Mattioni","original_name":"Franco Mattioni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6770e88e005810c23f9280b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5146798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giziana Vetrano","original_name":"Giziana Vetrano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6770e89c1f2c5d9301928b4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5146799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Sefusatti","original_name":"Luigi Sefusatti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6770e8a81efc2434cf12f58b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5146795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enzo Facente","original_name":"Enzo Facente","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6770e860fbe3722a9861372b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/vxpsVHpqBOUVxQsHNEu2ibz0MVj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
