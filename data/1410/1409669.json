The money was for directing his first music video for a virtually unknown Philly rocker named Alan Mann. Mann's song \"Christmas on the Block\" became a Philly radio staple and Murray's music video, against the odds, became the first indie video to play on MTV. This experience, tainted by Mann's tragic passing, remained with Murray through the years. With \"Fear of Heights,\" Murray travels back to that time to answer some nagging questions and to illuminate the dark, mysterious life and music of Alan Mann.","popularity":0.1553,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":248749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Attention Films","origin_country":""},{"id":248750,"logo_path":null,"name":"F&G Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Fear of Heights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Mann","original_name":"Alan Mann","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6772aff4d8dc22e6c6927d4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Murray","original_name":"Rich Murray","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6772afff3fc76ea58892819b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Murray","original_name":"Rich Murray","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772a0d2fbe3722a9861618c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149097,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthony Falco","original_name":"Anthony Falco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772a0f205c46ab3fc92aa7b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Murray","original_name":"Rich Murray","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772a10463f90f8f66927967","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Murray","original_name":"Rich Murray","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772a114e9cac07ec412b752","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149097,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthony Falco","original_name":"Anthony Falco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772a123e9cac07ec412b75c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Debra Bouchegnies","original_name":"Debra Bouchegnies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772a14b77e2b6d47892a215","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149103,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joanna Graham","original_name":"Joanna Graham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772a16143a21982da12b9a5","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35118461","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5699,"name":"music video"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":344476,"name":"mtv"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
