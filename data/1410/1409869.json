However this future is now in jeopardy as larger modern trains continue running over an aged rail system that was never designed for this type of weight. The result, a dramatic decrease in speed and increase in derailments costing the railroad thousands of dollars every year!  Wisconsin & Southern Railroad has developed a multi-year rail upgrade plan. This plan will replace the aged rail network with new heavier track capable of handling the growing demands of Wisconsin's rail future.","popularity":0.3634,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leclerc Brothers Motion
