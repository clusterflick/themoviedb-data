Monita's aunt Bei grows increasingly wary of her niece's affection for Fan—an impoverished student who has to work to support himself through school—and presents to the principal vicious slanders against Fan. Already devastated by Fan's expulsion and departure without farewell, Monita is dealt a further blow when her father dies suddenly in the US after the collapse of his business. A near victim of sexual assault, Monita leaves the aunt and her licentious lover and works as a helper of the painter Szi Ming in his studio, but is soon given the boot by his jealous wife. A year passes. Monita is chosen to be the maid of honour at her best friend Ann's wedding which reunites her with Fan. Fan has returned from his sailing tenure to open a restaurant named after the love of his life, Monita. The estranged couple rekindles their love.","popularity":0.0694,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of Monita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Yang","original_name":"Evan Yang","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/1emXqbzGX2g05DEVEa6P2w1nc99.jpg","credit_id":"67722757b70013cc0f616f6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Yee Tat's novel of the same title; Taiwan release date: 9/11/1968","release_date":"1968-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
