Like many of Chekhov’s heroes who attempt to overcome fate, she is doomed to fail, but it is in the attempt itself that she becomes so close and dear to us. Ultimately, we empathize with and love this very recognizable person who can’t adequately protect herself, her love, and her home.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/18B7aveGwRgg9ydny67mp7eRQXT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5150127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Pinaitytė","original_name":"Samantha Pinaitytė","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"677325b86234c1b46f615f10","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2679856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitry Krymov","original_name":"Dmitry Krymov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677323d898f2f82fc4928598","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2679856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitry Krymov","original_name":"Dmitry Krymov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677324130f248e8508129f09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nMtw00i5sxPJ1HSmTn2Et6Mg4Rq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1544,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/18B7aveGwRgg9ydny67mp7eRQXT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fragment Trailer / Directed by Dmitry Krymov / Klaipėda Drama Theatre","key":"q2_m1x5pDlk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-11-03T17:34:17.000Z","id":"677369955f1c4fa473618f1e"}]}}}
