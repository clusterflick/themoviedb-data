Poetry and iridescent cinematography reimagine a walk along the Maas River, where bodies merge and emotions shimmer. Through a technical experiment that misinterprets raw camera signals, the film crafts a perception far removed from the clarity of conventional photography. Guided by Clara Afonso’s visceral poem Corps D’écumes, we are invited to linger in confusion and discover what unfolds when the boundaries of our interpretive frameworks give way.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maas Confusion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2825268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ugo Petronin","original_name":"Ugo Petronin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67716aae1f2c5d9301929f1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oUNrRGGi1V2wKhN44fhCfXcUrmZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
