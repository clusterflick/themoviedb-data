Nthabiseng tells their story directly to the camera and traces a history that moves from a tiny village of only five houses in rural Limpopo, to their bruising first experience with a doctor in town at the age of thirteen which leaves them feeling that something is wrong with them. The feeling persists till they are at university in Johannesburg and realize that, far from getting the help they had imagined, their story is simply a fascinating research case for the doctors they visit. As they begin to meet intersex activists, they see that the isolation and erasure of intersex people is systemic and that there are many others like themselves. Nthabiseng the activist emerges and steps into their power.","popularity":0.0887,"poster_path":"/6mBvYiQ5jlDSdnF9QozznZjDW4Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reclaiming Intersex (while Black, genderqueer and feminist in South Africa)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4956930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nthabiseng Mokoena","original_name":"Nthabiseng Mokoena","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"677190781f2c5d930192a69a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5147731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabrielle Le Roux","original_name":"Gabrielle Le Roux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677190421f2c5d930192a673","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4956930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nthabiseng Mokoena","original_name":"Nthabiseng Mokoena","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771904e1f2c5d930192a687","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6mBvYiQ5jlDSdnF9QozznZjDW4Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
