Tasked with cleaning up after the murders to keep his best friendâ€™s secret, he struggles with guilt and fear, yet feels trapped by his loyalty and manipulation. As their dynamic unravels, the killer gives him an ultimatum: kill someone to prove his worth or be killed himself. He refuses to cross the line so the killer hunts down his friend, but fate takes an unexpected turn, sparing him in a way neither could have predicted. The film ends with a bittersweet and unexpected sense of relief, reminding us that the worst we fear rarely comes to pass.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"A story that survived everything but the truth.","title":"The Preservationist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4855860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Monaghan","original_name":"Matthew Monaghan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771d0815863b1e81912a548","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
