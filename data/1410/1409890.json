It's an industrial process film at heart, following the miners' journey to work, descent at the pithead, labour underground, and the cut coal's journey by rail to Grimsby docks. Stylish and poetic, the scenes at the coalface are charged with elemental drama.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2oAvpfy2STOI5HTc80qYhVaIElV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1928-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tour of a British Coal Mine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Hanmer","original_name":"Charles Hanmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677326be63f90f8f669285c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2oAvpfy2STOI5HTc80qYhVaIElV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
