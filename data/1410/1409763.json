The protagonists try by all means to communicate, but they don't know what to say to each other. They may be deaf, but they're certainly not dumb. They wander around hoping that the environment around them will listen and respond. So, like bewildered surveyors, our two characters wander through urban and natural spaces, changing distances as they see fit. Moving from refuge to building, they see how fragile our environments are. In the beginning, they stand beside a waterfall. At the end, they face concrete and glass.","popularity":0.3724,"poster_path":"/pErU5cceRDRgAVdUxLgKkXuswkS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Est-ce ainsi que les hommes vivent ?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Pech","original_name":"Nicolas Pech","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"City Individual","credit_id":"6772e391b70013cc0f618b18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clémentine Bron","original_name":"Clémentine Bron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Forest Individual","credit_id":"6772e3bf3fc76ea588928bac","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clémentine Bron","original_name":"Clémentine Bron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772e33cbf10ff198461f2aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Pech","original_name":"Nicolas Pech","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772e34fb70013cc0f618ad9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":889,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pErU5cceRDRgAVdUxLgKkXuswkS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":605}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":14529,"name":"improvisation"},{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":230877,"name":"crossroads"},{"id":232129,"name":"incommunicability"},{"id":237260,"name":"urban exploration"},{"id":243267,"name":"industrialization"},{"id":269808,"name":"introspective"},{"id":274386,"name":"silence"},{"id":281300,"name":"existentialist"},{"id":309974,"name":"absurd"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
