Not only the mining of silver and copper, but also the associated “industry” characterize the villages and hamlets of the region. With the arrival of the Fuggers, the Tyrolean trades disappear. Power, powerlessness, wealth and poverty - new times dawn in the “silver empire”.  In 1521, the Fuggers take over the exploitation of silver mining in Schwaz/Tyrol. This marks the beginning of a new European era. Schwaz silver is used to buy empires, finance wars and set progress in motion. But it is not only the “silver town” of Schwaz, but also the entire region around Schwaz along the Lower Inn Valley, as well as other regions of Europe, that provide innovations with silver and also the lesser-known copper mining.","popularity":0.1655,"poster_path":"/jhrlC3hlUw9ew7rwncQhYPg9t4C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produktion
