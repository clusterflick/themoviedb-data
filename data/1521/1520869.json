Ever since it's 1978 premiere at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, it has made it's triumphal progress around the world in more than thirty productions as the most successful Shakespeare opera of our time. The remorseless logic of the action and plot and the primal force of irresistible sonic fantasies give this work the power to hold the attention of it's listeners and viewers from the first moment to the last. The great theme of self-deception is fancifully portrayed in this captivating stage production by Karoline Gruber with a retreat into the interior of a far from frail old man. It is not senility that drives Lear, brilliantly sung by Bo Skovhus, into isolation but his hyperactive ego. The first Hamburg performance of Lear is a musical achievement of the highest order.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zUTqHzVmzqj940PTe4QhYwJ9cZb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staatsoper Hamburg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aribert Reimann: Lear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Skovhus","original_name":"Bo Skovhus","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":"/wK6k0oyZlMJLqLM9Ew2sQHdgtCO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"King Lear","credit_id":"6887c451b94e667f8b52b6ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Pieweck","original_name":"Katja Pieweck","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Goneril","credit_id":"6887c46798c597f11a8a85fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hellen Kwon","original_name":"Hellen Kwon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Regan","credit_id":"6887c47965f0807e59d9be20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1682083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siobhan Stagg","original_name":"Siobhan Stagg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/htiW1ZTOC6aulCv1WuAOOXaCls4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cordelia","credit_id":"6887c48cf56b89c49b52b916","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Leder","original_name":"Erwin Leder","popularity":0.3412,"profile_path":"/4V6ewUr0KAMl8C2xvWvg8JPjsab.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Actor (Fool)","credit_id":"6887c4a0f56b89c49b52b91a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2777303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauri Vasar","original_name":"Lauri Vasar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hza3tvyQtJVznk3IMI3UkKfmDdp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Earl of Gloucester","credit_id":"6887c4b4d098f600d972f373","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Watts","original_name":"Andrew Watts","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Edgar","credit_id":"6887c4c9da3bd92a1a55fb4d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Homrich","original_name":"Martin Homrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Edmund","credit_id":"6887c4fa2d9055256dd9b584","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Miedl","original_name":"Christian Miedl","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4PojR90iOmPhcD7Z1iZAhlqawSp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Duke of Albany","credit_id":"6887c518d098f600d972f37a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Galliard","original_name":"Peter Galliard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Duke of Cornwall","credit_id":"6887c52c51b22c777816c94e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürgen Sacher","original_name":"Jürgen Sacher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Earl of Kent","credit_id":"6887c54150915a744e246f61","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3778046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilhelm Schwinghammer","original_name":"Wilhelm Schwinghammer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"King of France","credit_id":"6887c55223e3f6d0903901f0","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frieder Stricker","original_name":"Frieder Stricker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Servant","credit_id":"6887c5673855a701642475b9","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2328034,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simone Young","original_name":"Simone Young","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nfk4e2r0j4D4vFVNjsXBHZqIbD3.jpg","credit_id":"6887c584fe85a1d5452472a1","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karoline Gruber","original_name":"Karoline Gruber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887c5b6096e0ed3fb72f5ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claus H.
