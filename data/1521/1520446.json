It also raises key questions about the tension between the drive for progress and the character of the city.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5gih37zBw6bqYxB75bV8pAGG8MZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise and Fall of Liberty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5590744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carol Thomson","original_name":"Carol Thomson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6886cb80e50e3bcc5516c635","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6406840","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5gih37zBw6bqYxB75bV8pAGG8MZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":281659,"name":"wistful"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
