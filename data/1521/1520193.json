Beside him, the driver is dead. The streets of Liberty City are empty, but his sins are not. Haunted by visions of the people he’s killed — and the person he used to be — he stumbles through a night filled with paranoia, betrayal, and bloody flashbacks. Each clue he uncovers leads him deeper into a conspiracy that may or may not be real. He sees faces from his past. Hears voices that aren't there. Fights enemies he can't prove exist.","popularity":0.2357,"poster_path":"/pgoSKVU589orB5IzPm37q1s6dyP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wasted","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5140898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","original_name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ceasar Rodriguez","credit_id":"68865b42e50e3bcc5516c3cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Chambers","original_name":"Zachary Chambers","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/xjcly5OB0V8awGRIUQUCdv3i09G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donovan Bellamy","credit_id":"68865b4f2f591ad8d18a7001","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Gordon","original_name":"Matthew Gordon","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Theodor Madsen","credit_id":"68865b5fe50e3bcc5516c3d1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"68865b783855a70164246da8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5140898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","original_name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68865b886c0df3da9b16c3ed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"68865b925a859be9d5f78d7e","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"68865b9f1733da38d252b419","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Gordon","original_name":"Matthew Gordon","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68865baa317a5cfe9cf790df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Chambers","original_name":"Zachary Chambers","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/xjcly5OB0V8awGRIUQUCdv3i09G.jpg","credit_id":"68865bb4889cf9581e246c6a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"68865bc3ef3c47ab8b55f3c4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"68865bcc1733da38d252b41c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgoSKVU589orB5IzPm37q1s6dyP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3149,"name":"gangster"},{"id":2340,"name":"paranoia"},{"id":10085,"name":"betrayal"},{"id":11469,"name":"memory loss"},{"id":10410,"name":"conspiracy"},{"id":155712,"name":"grand theft auto"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"},{"id":217102,"name":"gta"},{"id":293287,"name":"ghost-world"},{"id":323114,"name":"crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
