Nearly a decade later, her teenage children, Cassandra and Alexander, uncover a secret: their mother’s disappearance was not natural — and may still be preventable.  Using experimental time-travel technology, the siblings go back to 1984 to find their young mother and warn her about what’s to come. But time is fragile. Their well-meaning interference causes unforeseen changes to the present.  When Cassandra and Alexander return to 2013, they find everything... perfect. Bella never vanished. Their childhood was happy. Their family is intact. But something feels wrong. Reality is unraveling beneath their feet. The price of rewriting history is catching up.","popularity":0.2357,"poster_path":"/lcv93bJoa7geGasK13J32NUj3Yr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forward to the Past","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cassandra Goth","credit_id":"6886652c65f0807e59d9b2f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5140898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","original_name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alexander Goth","credit_id":"6886653b48ea55973355f4b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belinda Soprano","original_name":"Belinda Soprano","popularity":0.0767,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bella Bachelor (Goth)","credit_id":"6886654ae242da0f0f55f37c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5589769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atticus Castiglione","original_name":"Atticus Castiglione","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mortimer Goth","credit_id":"6886655839849ffe8dd9b2a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Dean Castiglione","original_name":"James Dean Castiglione","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Don Lothario","credit_id":"68866568468d79140272f04a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6886657e8beea02e6e8a7066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"68866584b94e667f8b52b063","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6886658e6309222fee72ee1d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"688665958b3b81d371246e48","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"688665a0c628188ef1f78f26","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"688665aae4afd09aec72ef66","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Gordon","original_name":"Matthew Gordon","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688665b622c579e4f0390580","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harley Coleman","original_name":"Harley Coleman","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688665c150eaf66252246c34","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lcv93bJoa7geGasK13J32NUj3Yr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4379,"name":"time travel"},{"id":161891,"name":"doppelgänger"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"},{"id":228795,"name":"butterfly effect"},{"id":240621,"name":"alien doppelganger"},{"id":273439,"name":"aliens"},{"id":341359,"name":"the sims"},{"id":355935,"name":"the sims 3"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
