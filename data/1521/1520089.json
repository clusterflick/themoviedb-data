The film is based on the revelation of the age-old wisdom and interethnic tolerance of the Ukrainian people during the terrible years of war, in particular how people ended up in Jewish ghettos and concentration camps, and their Ukrainian compatriots, despite the threat of death, saved their lives.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/ikRSZKuLAzgACd7KBsT4PbCrAPA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61460,"logo_path":"/3yPCkEWvnabeiF8l3sjUBHlRq0j.png","name":"Ukrainian State Film Agency","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":134790,"logo_path":null,"name":"For-Post International Producer Center","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Test of Humanity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Shapiro","original_name":"Alexandr Shapiro","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/eYILqhFn7pyCIGRQ0l2qA1HGEl1.jpg","credit_id":"6886309190c737dad716c3b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5589569,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iryna Chmola","original_name":"Iryna Chmola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688630a3317a5cfe9cf78fb3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087040,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oleksandr Driz","original_name":"Oleksandr Driz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6886310f9f14f68eb2246a00","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ikRSZKuLAzgACd7KBsT4PbCrAPA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Іспит на людяність","key":"0Xbr_S4uOX0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-07T06:27:24.000Z","id":"68863129b756a2f57d52ad38"}]}}}
