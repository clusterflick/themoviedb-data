It is leaving lightly...  Not so far away, elsewhere, where time passes, has passed, will pass, on the horizon of time...  The image glides on its path, a paper cargo ship, daughter of oblivion, free of history. It passes like a cloud, a dead leaf...  A few stones remain, marked by vague eternity.  A voice passes, from time to time, from distant memory... An ancient traveller?  A distracted vagabond?  It stands far away, in the rolling of time,  silent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/87gmq4wJcmS3KXihAv58ak45sds.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poussières","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1798635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martine Rousset","original_name":"Martine Rousset","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/gDt8NJ9FCBycm5DhFxBFiNzYaho.jpg","credit_id":"6887415ce242da0f0f55f69a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/87gmq4wJcmS3KXihAv58ak45sds.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
