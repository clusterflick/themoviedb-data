Villagers shifted from fighting demolition to painstakingly relocating and rebuilding their community. In 2011, they planned the new village together—including house design, sewage, and land use—while facing government pressure to move out by November. Road access issues caused additional worries. As demolition began, villagers stood together to protect their homes and demanded time to build before moving. By May 2011, villagers left their longtime homes for makeshift housing on newly bought farmland, continuing their collective effort. Their unity in overcoming countless challenges set an example for other rural communities and shows that real resistance is a long journey requiring ongoing attention.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/rX5U3jbGrIK5ukn1tdsn5tmkwSO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269371,"logo_path":null,"name":"v-artivist productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2013-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":310,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raging Land 3: Three Valleys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"怒れる沿線：三谷（さんや）","type":"Japanese"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887956873da5eb0cb52ba25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887957580aff51a8555f645","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688795852f591ad8d18a7592","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3324190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"RagingLandInTaiwan","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3HMYjQNY1S5wQKVcuBSgAABqFMR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rX5U3jbGrIK5ukn1tdsn5tmkwSO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1018}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12354,"name":"hong kong"},{"id":161662,"name":"urban development"},{"id":223199,"name":"social movement"},{"id":270719,"name":"hong kong protests"},{"id":356092,"name":"land rehabilitation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"11th Hong Kong Social Movement Film Festival","release_date":"2013-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Special screening at HKICC Lee Shau Kee School of Creativity","release_date":"2013-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival 2013","release_date":"2013-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Reverse Niche – Dialogue and Rebuilding at the City’s Edge An exhibition in Hong Kong, Osaka and Taiwan","release_date":"2014-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Special screening","release_date":"2013-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Zhu-Buzeu Film Festival","release_date":"2013-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
