For his latest and most dangerous act yet, he sets out to break the Guinness World Record for the highest controlled fall ever attempted — using none other than the Statue of Liberty as his launch point.  But the fall doesn’t go as planned. Before the cameras roll, Tim slips prematurely and plummets off the statue, smashing into the emergency security pads below. Though the pads break his fall, the impact leaves him unconscious and in critical condition. While his body lies in a coma, Tim's mind becomes trapped in a nightmarish loop — an eternal, slow-motion fall that never ends.","popularity":0.2214,"poster_path":"/i64seDdufLeXh20NkFp703dAPC8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano
