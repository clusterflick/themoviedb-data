Leela is portrayed as irresponsible and impulsive as she acknowledges her desire for Moti and has a child by him. Bina then releases Moti from his promise. Moti suffers when he is told by Bina’s father (Sankantha) that she is dead, while Leela’s father (Pande) enjoins his daughter to commit suicide if Moti does not marry her. In spite of the film’s endorsement of ‘traditional’, lethally oppressive patriarchal mores, incarnated by the women’s fathers, Mehboob’s narrative at least dares to depict a woman who refuses to feel guilty about her desire.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":157,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hum Tum Aur Woh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":632547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Motilal","original_name":"Motilal","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/vnjwVUrxk7DUEm3vYjl3IxtUCkh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Moti","credit_id":"6886f96dfbcc2b69173902dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3045221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Banerjee","original_name":"Maya Banerjee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bina","credit_id":"6886f976dff0081dac72f290","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3643727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose","original_name":"Rose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Leela","credit_id":"6886f984a854e42eb3f791d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4532808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yakub","original_name":"Yakub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6886f98cbe0fabb0b238ff62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4795891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bhudo Advani","original_name":"Bhudo Advani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6886f99dfbcc2b69173902e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harish","original_name":"Harish","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6886f9ae6199336bf1246993","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sankatha","original_name":"Sankatha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bina's Father","credit_id":"6886f9baa854e42eb3f791d8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5541341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pande","original_name":"Pande","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Leela's Father","credit_id":"6886f9d63628225df7d9b283","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunalini Devi","original_name":"Sunalini Devi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6886f9e22429d74293d9b2f1","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehboob Khan","original_name":"Mehboob Khan","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/fdhfI0t9uKyP3uZKLYkKiYZQvbV.jpg","credit_id":"6886fa161bc0fd1b57d9b604","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1635687,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anil Biswas","original_name":"Anil Biswas","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6886fa2b126c47dd6516ca2c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zia Sarhadi","original_name":"Zia Sarhadi","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6886fa3581c1232eb18a72e6","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14074,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Faredoon A.
