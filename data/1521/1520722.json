Suddenly, weekly meetings, guided tours, protests, and ambiguous government consultations entered their routines. They had to recount their personal histories and the meaning of life. The common belief that protests were only about money began to loosen. The word \"agriculture\" reemerged for Hongkongers. The timeline depicted in the film leads up to the peak of the anti-high-speed rail protests around the Legislative Council. In the end, the railway was decided to build. In spring and summer 2010, villagers searched for land and negotiated with the government to rebuild their homes and lifestyle, valuing community, and coexistence with nature. What sustains their deep connection to land and life?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9R2btlIWeSY1JCI9Gia4n6wX2xn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269371,"logo_path":null,"name":"v-artivist productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2009-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raging Land 1: A Record of Choi Yuen Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688781c790d9bd73978a7619","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688782be81c1232eb18a74fb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688782c82d9055256dd9b46e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"RagingLandInTaiwan","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j3nxkHg0RiiVQPTMznqalUgfSHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1620},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jY8Oj16kx4CIWeejA7LoBEZcJB4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1613,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9R2btlIWeSY1JCI9Gia4n6wX2xn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1077}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12354,"name":"hong kong"},{"id":161662,"name":"urban development"},{"id":223199,"name":"social movement"},{"id":270719,"name":"hong kong protests"},{"id":355974,"name":"anti high speed rail (anti-xrl)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"7th Hong Kong Social Movement Film Festival","release_date":"2009-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
