Rather than stopping him in his tracks, this challenge ignited a passion for mechanics and racing cars, fueled in part by his father, who ran a service station in Auckland. McLarenâ€™s full journey is explored, starting from local races in New Zealand, to his early triumph in Formula 1, when he became the youngest Grand Prix winner at age 22; to the founding of Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd in 1963, and his untimely death in 1970 during a test run of the M8D at the Goodwood Circuit.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":242427,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Andrea Iervolino Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Untitled Bruce McLaren Biopic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276565,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Iervolino","original_name":"Andrea Iervolino","popularity":0.183,"profile_path":"/fYcOinCNh1HMZIcGkO3TXGj3c1Q.jpg","credit_id":"68874761c74b327f5a390112","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10039,"name":"racing"},{"id":195593,"name":"physical disability"},{"id":219865,"name":"auckland"},{"id":233981,"name":"formula one (f1)"},{"id":340972,"name":"biographical drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
