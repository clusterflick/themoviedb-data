The overwhelming emotions shown in the movie come together to create a nostalgic feeling understood by all. The film mostly takes place inside a car, during a conversation between two friends,Edd & Seb. The character of Edd, played by the director Eduardo Garcia, seems to be lost within the chaos of his own mind, unexpectedly being transported to different memories. These memories represent a journey of difficult emotions, including: the struggle with abandonment, the need for family, the absence of home, and unrealized love. Seb, played by Tayo Sonuga, is the anchor that keeps Edd grounded. His dialogue lights the way when Edd is trapped in a dark place, reminding him that everything will be okay.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/oCms9KXZpdgvhAYpWXx6UAQwsaz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elsewhere/Forward","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5591576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Garcia","original_name":"Eduardo Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Edd","credit_id":"6887609250eaf662522471d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5591577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tayo Sonuga","original_name":"Tayo Sonuga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Seb","credit_id":"688760a6a854e42eb3f7935f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5591575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Garcia","original_name":"Eduardo Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688760417b01f1092616c6f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5591575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Garcia","original_name":"Eduardo Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887610a8beea02e6e8a74fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oCms9KXZpdgvhAYpWXx6UAQwsaz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
