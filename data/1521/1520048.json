The Resurrection of Dr. Shinigami","overview":"Rem Ayanokōji is a \"dream hunter\", a person capable of entering the dreams of sleeping people and fighting the demons causing nightmares. The stories have their basis in supernatural and standard horror, with action scenes and mystery thrown in. The pilot episode was originally animated by Aubec and released as a side project OVA which contained a short episode. This was later re-released as \"Special Version\", removing all pornographic scenes and adding nearly 30 minutes of new footage made by Anime R.  This first OVA contains two short stories and an interstitial episode where Rem explains the basics of sleep patterns. In the first short, Rem is called to save a girl who is weakened and catatonic; she enters her dream and faces the tentacle monster residing there. In the second, a serial killer who died 5 years ago has returned and is killing young girls in their sleep.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lTMFvvHVYKa1pfnSYs7piwlbney.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anime R","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Hunter Rem — Special Version: Nightmare!
