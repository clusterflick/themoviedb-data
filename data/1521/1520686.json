It took place on 5 July 2025, at Villa Park in Aston, Birmingham, England, very close to where the band formed in 1968. The event concluded with the final live performances by both Black Sabbath and singer Ozzy Osbourne; it also marked the first time since 2005 that the band's original lineup (Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward) had performed together live. Osbourne, no longer able to walk due to advanced Parkinson's disease, sang while seated on a throne. Seventeen days after the show, Osbourne died at the age of 76. The proceeds raised amounted to â‚¬140 million, and will be donated to Acorns Children's Hospice, Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Cure Parkinson.","popularity":0.2857,"poster_path":"/bpSkBWuMK999M8yTNX3zCUrW2p4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Sabbath: Back to the Beginning","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozzy Osbourne","original_name":"Ozzy Osbourne","popularity":3.802,"profile_path":"/mixaKGozKp2Nrzj7YbPYHYpkXoT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68877253fb418b1ac138fe0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Iommi","original_name":"Tony Iommi","popularity":0.393,"profile_path":"/cs8npD3gcw2s387gPup7FJUhqNX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6887726c9677276c5116ca65","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geezer Butler","original_name":"Geezer Butler","popularity":0.1704,"profile_path":"/dI5g3Xze7YOypwjYPiruZSxsGED.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6887727804999af3d452b4b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Ward","original_name":"Bill Ward","popularity":0.3265,"profile_path":"/5alC3U4hbYkZNcU95JrjaEPOUCI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"688772983855a70164247268","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Morello","original_name":"Tom Morello","popularity":0.2807,"profile_path":"/gTN2tWZkatEvbVmBeurA5LQYlR6.jpg","credit_id":"688773c36585bd4edbd9bdf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tIDAi0f38RBqxbGpXBkNZ3wdNcx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bpSkBWuMK999M8yTNX3zCUrW2p4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1054}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
