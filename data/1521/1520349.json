As the town falls into chaos, most residents go into hiding. But Brittany, a teenage girl home alone while her parents vacation for their 20th anniversary, chooses a different path.  Devastated by the loss of her boyfriend Chad — who died just two months prior in a car accident — Brittany gears up with her father’s tools and sets out to the town cemetery. Convinced that Chad might have been among the reanimated dead, her mission is not survival, but reunion.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/k2WKVfSI5Y5WWsWbG4aoSGNnAwB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano
