Max is everything that Leo could want: she's beautiful; she's smart; she has a particular fondness for late 19th century French poetry; and as an actress who's biggest role is portraying a dancing, chocolate sprinkled dough nut in a local commercial, she is very much a kindred spirit. The only problem? Leo is engaged to Rachel, a bi-polar spitfire with a penchant for violence through kitchen utensils.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7F2oZ66QnAyFyVgHBzd3lmvlzYi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A love story for those of us who are not the romantic lead.","title":"Leo's Love(s)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":948762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Cackowski","original_name":"Craig Cackowski","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/pomSoRjZJvWyWz4wKvC0sKiErYV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"6887bd7eac0991943b16cab4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Cain","original_name":"Jennifer Cain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"6887bd930f25d300c352b8f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1378787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Erin Decker","original_name":"Kelly Erin Decker","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/o2O6f0sdZKGL1xHBeQlsrRE0vF4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"6887bda5c2adade24055f8b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":221679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Holleman","original_name":"Lily Holleman","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/pady3HjxlryuKWYjYrIaJtzFpLa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Max","credit_id":"6887bdbdef3c47ab8b55f9fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parvesh Cheena","original_name":"Parvesh Cheena","popularity":0.4325,"profile_path":"/8N9EwDfLezI8b3v7ELW4aTCSixV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Corpman","credit_id":"6887bdcebe0fabb0b2390365","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Lacatena","original_name":"Tim Lacatena","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":"/yHiIJRpGyQRK2ynJKWrm1Dgosy1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rufus","credit_id":"6887bdef7e0188d5cb72f25f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3468046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Jordan","original_name":"Danny Jordan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bernard","credit_id":"6887be07e4afd09aec72f612","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2555363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Razowsky","original_name":"David Razowsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5gKAdV6JWPO9sMxkbq2O7ZyFWCM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dr. Everstein","credit_id":"6887be1aa571086a4055f513","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592425,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Weischedel","original_name":"Alan Weischedel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Leo","credit_id":"6887be2bfb418b1ac138ff31","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592425,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Weischedel","original_name":"Alan Weischedel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887bd4eb1b942dfdc3900e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592425,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Weischedel","original_name":"Alan Weischedel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887bd5aa684bf0e3872f61d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2355697","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7F2oZ66QnAyFyVgHBzd3lmvlzYi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
