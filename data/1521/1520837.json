In the Tyrolean Alps, a chain of new hydroelectric plants is planned, including the controversial damming of the pristine Platzertal valley. This documentary by filmmaker Harry Putz captures the fragile beauty of these untouched alpine ecosystems and explores what’s at stake — not just for the environment, but for local communities and future generations. Through interviews with residents, scientists, and activists, Down To The Last Drop reveals the high environmental cost of outdated energy policies in the face of the global biodiversity and climate crisis.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/rgNL5ROsvjk4uwwNa525LPEDoRt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Down To The Last Drop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Dagostin","original_name":"Lilian Dagostin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Österreichischer Alpenverein, Leitung Raumplanung und Naturschutz","credit_id":"6887af83fbcc2b6917390778","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3070435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Hofmann","original_name":"Anita Hofmann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Citizens' initiative for a livable Kaunertal","credit_id":"6887af91e088d578c78a7778","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernhard Steidl","original_name":"Bernhard Steidl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"CEO SOURCE TO SEA Kajakschool","credit_id":"6887af9e2f591ad8d18a7779","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Urbanek","original_name":"Bettina Urbanek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Water protection expert WWF Österreich","credit_id":"6887afa8126c47dd6516cdd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leopold Füreder","original_name":"Leopold Füreder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Institute for Ecology at Innsbruck University","credit_id":"6887afb703dfd1f10216d5fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Götsch","original_name":"Marianne Götsch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Water protection expert WWF Österreich","credit_id":"6887afc4ac0991943b16ca6f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Reischer","original_name":"Michael Reischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tyrolean Environmental Ombudsman, biologist, ecologist","credit_id":"6887afcf3628225df7d9b4df","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinhard Scheiber","original_name":"Reinhard Scheiber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Spokesman for agricultural communities, farmer, tourism expert","credit_id":"6887afda51b22c777816c8bd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zacharias Schähle","original_name":"Zacharias Schähle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Aquatic ecologist, Tiroler Fischereiverband","credit_id":"6887b00904999af3d452b613","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Putz","original_name":"Harry Putz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887adbc3855a70164247561","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Putz","original_name":"Harry Putz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887af61223102bc3e55f8e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rgNL5ROsvjk4uwwNa525LPEDoRt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258541,"name":"biodiversity"},{"id":271378,"name":"investigative"},{"id":309468,"name":"hydropower"},{"id":311826,"name":"climate crisis"},{"id":356109,"name":"environmental activism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Down To The Last Drop - Trailer 2024","key":"SgpRc2aY5I4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-24T14:13:02.000Z","id":"6887b1212bdd11277a2471a0"}]}}}
