In 2009, villagers protested and petitioned, sparking the anti-express rail movement. Despite their efforts, the railway plan was approved in early 2010. Forced to choose between leaving or rebuilding, they opted for the government’s land rehabilitation scheme to create a new village together. With volunteers, they searched for land in Pat Heung and fought to prove their status as farmers. Many outsiders misunderstood, believing the villagers received generous compensation and government help. Yet, it was the villagers’ shared determination and love for their land and way of life that carried them through, even as the once-barren longan trees bloomed again in 2010.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/6A2BzPC8jdkmKqM9CGeYS8zPzlV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269371,"logo_path":null,"name":"v-artivist productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2010-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raging Land 2 : Breaking new ground through Thorns and Thistles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688788ec01f7d024388a73cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688788fad9da18e5168a7730","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5590918,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","original_name":"Benny Chan Yin Kai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68878908b94e667f8b52b4bc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"RagingLandInTaiwan","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yfClgQbdWzAbL44KnFdvJkIYjUh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2244,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6A2BzPC8jdkmKqM9CGeYS8zPzlV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1496}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12354,"name":"hong kong"},{"id":161662,"name":"urban development"},{"id":223199,"name":"social movement"},{"id":270719,"name":"hong kong protests"},{"id":356092,"name":"land rehabilitation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"8th Hong Kong Social Movement Film Festival","release_date":"2010-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
