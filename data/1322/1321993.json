Local residents of one of the Zakarpattia villages sheltered them in a picturesque house on a hillside, next to a river.  Doing what you know and love for the benefit of Ukraine is the best thing an artist can do in times of war. This is how the Palianytsia project was born - a series of objects made of stones cut by a mountain river.  Zhanna sells them to patrons and galleries and uses the proceeds to buy bulletproof vests, radios, thermal imagers and other things our soldiers need. Before she sends her ‘loaves’ to Venice for the Biennale, Zhanna holds an exhibition in the village where she now lives, so that the people who have taken her in can be the first to see her art.","popularity":0.148,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":154771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suspilne Media","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":117001,"logo_path":"/tLhSGNNKX4VwCNbvPMissO3ea5j.png","name":"Babylon'13","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kadyrova's palianytsia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2743143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Sautkin","original_name":"Ivan Sautkin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/dw4Twd1RD6sjLOG5hH2TejjU0HN.jpg","credit_id":"66a8b5f04d2d2ab28003ebef","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689692,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Olena Zashko","original_name":"Olena Zashko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8b5ff7aeef07dc2cd16cd","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Yeresko","original_name":"Anna Yeresko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8b6116585ebb63cf2a6eb","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":301386,"name":"russo-ukrainian war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
