Sotillo and his band gang are plotting to steal the silver, but the fore-warned Nostromo has a plan to outwit them. He meets the silver train far up the road and has the shipment transferred to a big wagon, sending it via side-streets to the wharf. He and his men stay with the train and fight of the bandits. Back at the wharf, Nostromo thinks about claiming the silver was lost in the battle and taking it for himself. He and his conscience struggles mightily.","popularity":0.3565,"poster_path":"/nsyrFH7FF2O6m8v5a0U2FvjhJZ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anyone that likes action should see this show.","title":"The Silver Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George O'Brien","original_name":"George O'Brien","popularity":0.5295,"profile_path":"/kW0JfbSCb6RzHvZEtBDzGuvzqIr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nostromo","credit_id":"66a2be7595bbae847e38478c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1639309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Rollens","original_name":"Jack Rollens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ramirez","credit_id":"66a2bea7c7271d45f9cf8850","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1503954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena D'Algy","original_name":"Helena D'Algy","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/9iCOZVMLNZAhAenAvN53JmgsNbv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Linda Viola","credit_id":"66a2c1c0e746bc4fe1c83898","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Renee","original_name":"Joan Renee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dPLytYzO4Xj5k1hYQfebgNLxN4v.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Giselle Viola","credit_id":"66a2c2fb2961724891384507","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Selbie","original_name":"Evelyn Selbie","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/l75Ol7KP1ku0K8ErZ46qW7bjWag.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother Teresa","credit_id":"66a2c31485b44ccacd0a0f04","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Tellegen","original_name":"Lou Tellegen","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/ztroYjioXrzZAlTXWGoUN8Ak3Fz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sotillo - the Bandit","credit_id":"66a2c33143e27bdf4214deda","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Matieson","original_name":"Otto Matieson","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/3ogR6169p5FaDr4lahC8RZa7PJZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Martin Decoud","credit_id":"66a2c35accddcfba1080f4a8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1000806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stewart Rome","original_name":"Stewart Rome","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/3IoLLGcJHNr5pkIzhcouAJCyhg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Charles Gould","credit_id":"66a2c3790972eda9bf05faaa","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedda Hopper","original_name":"Hedda Hopper","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/kfXPY1cSrOmjJ3TYrGF4giT6EPI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Gould","credit_id":"66a2c39880e0e4c924088b19","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harvey Clark","original_name":"Harvey Clark","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/mRxpnLg6ybAnFCoEOu3sK6b8hMV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tito","credit_id":"66a2c3b5e395e17f196124e3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Clayton","original_name":"Gilbert Clayton","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dr. Monygham","credit_id":"66a2c3e1bffb534f84e10246","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rowland V.
