The barcode was copied onto a transparent sticker, then glued to the film up to the film's soundtrack. The barcode then emits a sound as it passes in front of the photocell. By sticking on a barcode of different sizes, the barcode plays on a two-octave scale (from low C to high C). Funnily enough, we can also see how volume varies with line contrast. The greater the contrast, the higher the volume.","popularity":0.2178,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barcodes","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4848191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilie Bjørgås Jordheim","original_name":"Cecilie Bjørgås Jordheim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a194115301d17f8ddd7e72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15478,"name":"art gallery"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
