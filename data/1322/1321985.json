Back in 2015, after being rescued from Luhansk, Sievierodonetsk became his home. In seven years, Igor has managed not only to staff the orchestra, but also to establish links with orchestras from Europe and different parts of Ukraine, and to show that Luhansk region has always been, is and will be Ukrainian.  Today, the battle for Sievierodonetsk is ongoing, and Russia's large-scale invasion is putting the musicians in front of new challenges. But they remember why it is worth taking to the stage again and again, to spread Ukrainian and European culture.","popularity":0.1159,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":154771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suspilne Media","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting with music: the history of the Luhansk Philharmonic Orchestra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3760025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadiia Mykolaienko","original_name":"Nadiia Mykolaienko","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8b4d34d2d2ab28003ebe6","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857155,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olena Vysokolian","original_name":"Olena Vysokolian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8b4e4be98e7e2b9a36fbc","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":301386,"name":"russo-ukrainian war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
