They perform signature song 'E Tū' — about Māori resistance against oppression — and take their message of justice to Detroit community station WDTR. In New York, UHP are interviewed by veteran DJ Imhotep Gary Bryd. Later they meet Abiodun Oyewole, from rap pioneers The Last Poets. This is a street level view of urban artists spreading a message of Indigenous and Black unity, and social justice. Solidarity was directed by Rongotai Lomas and UHP lead vocalist Dean Hapeta.","popularity":0.718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We heard about you, we've never seen no rap group from New Zealand.
