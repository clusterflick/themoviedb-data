Post Lucem explores the vibration and movement of light that flows and transforms, either compacting, changing color, multiplying and creating a visual spectacle. This short film uses the stop motion technique with long exposure photographs, using the light painting method, in which brushstrokes of light are created in the air that are captured by the camera. Light represents the energy left behind by bodies and how it transmutes over time. This is an allegory to life, since in this the only constant is change, and we just have to flow and enjoy it.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/aJsBxQCM8CHzcxFBayFFhOf9ZcL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Post Lucem","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Conconi","original_name":"Giovanni Conconi","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hombre","credit_id":"66a1e8eb22981dd12f52bf5f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4848481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Haro","original_name":"Sandra Haro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1e9544744d378240a1184","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4848479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricio Brown","original_name":"Patricio Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1e933c5e20d62a818ed06","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Beltrán Ulrich","original_name":"Emilio Beltrán Ulrich","popularity":0.0736,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1e96cf410fb5dd314dbc6","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4848442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabella Conconi","original_name":"Isabella Conconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dtJOlRo6zvGbykvjqW6XaazS70j.jpg","credit_id":"66a1e90834a0e6530da0c922","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4848480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karla Santana","original_name":"Karla Santana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1e9455301d17f8ddda3dd","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4848442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabella Conconi","original_name":"Isabella Conconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dtJOlRo6zvGbykvjqW6XaazS70j.jpg","credit_id":"66a1e914a903a8b4c60a0d4c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7pWOPWRyo9VyXhRG1sAmHAyx6HP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g3uN18eqQVQWJfvDDuk46WW2oif.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/85z08R483Ys9BZvLCSXw9nMA1nv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJsBxQCM8CHzcxFBayFFhOf9ZcL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
