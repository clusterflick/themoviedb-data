Hailing from the shores of the Black Sea in Sozopol, he departed from his father's home at the dawn of the 20th century, never to return. In her desire to delve into her own heritage, his great-granddaughter embarks on her first visit to the coastal town. However, does the world of the artist's childhood still linger in that place? One thing remains unequivocal - his memories, awash with waves, mythical sea creatures, ethereal woodlands, and the silhouettes of nymphs, find their ongoing narrative on his canvases. As an exhibition featuring Gounaropoulos' creations takes shape within the Art Gallery, the citizens of Sozopol traverse through time, antiquated maps and tomes chronicling the town's history. This movie pays homage to the memories and to Giorgos Gounaropoulos from Sozopol.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8haa17CqpfatHSDrVoTn3B3CpNF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2023-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giorgos Gounaropoulos from Sozopol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisaveta Stantcheva","original_name":"Elisaveta Stantcheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a2535d0fc83202c3467bde","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849082,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jassen Haralampiev","original_name":"Jassen Haralampiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a25389cd2e302dbe467bc8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisaveta Stantcheva","original_name":"Elisaveta Stantcheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a2533d4ed33ef620e7fc2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28755443","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8haa17CqpfatHSDrVoTn3B3CpNF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sozopol, premiere screening","release_date":"2023-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian Edition","release_date":"2024-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Ukrainian Edition","release_date":"2024-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
