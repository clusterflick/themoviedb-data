A kind of tribute through the testimonies of the people who loved him, contextualized with images of the political and social moment of the time, which contribute to the rescue of his memory and his poetic word, which was expressed hand in hand with his unfailing commitment to freedom. Javier Heraud, the guerrilla poet, was murdered in the Madre de Dios River in Puerto Maldonado in 1963. He was 21 years old.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":234790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grupo de Cine Liberación Sin Rodeos S.A.
