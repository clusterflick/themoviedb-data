My older brother got into trouble. Again. After another entanglement, I realize that I can no longer ignore the problems that follow him around, and which seem to be taking over my life. I use the camera to get answers from my family and a wall of silence melts away. Through a mix of amusing, intense, and eye-opening encounters, I begin to understand how relations in my family, especially with my mother, were influenced by an unspoken expression. Strange Birds is an intimate film that reveals an unspoken story about special parenting and the children who grow up in its shadow.","popularity":0.1855,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116016,"logo_path":"/yrrmF7zlFFJAiCGOTdp8LDv8ZRH.png","name":"Kan","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":144051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Makor Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":100053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gesher Multicultural Film Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":142770,"logo_path":null,"name":"The New Fund for Cinema and TV (NFCT)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Birds","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849321,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noa Weinstein","original_name":"Noa Weinstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a272b09523563c27d06f84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shakked Auerbach","original_name":"Shakked Auerbach","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a2726749a40fe7d55d36a3","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394329,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Neta Dvorkis","original_name":"Neta Dvorkis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a272c70f8106dd00ca7df1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4715564,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Noa Weinstein","original_name":"Noa Weinstein","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a272b77c18de66f1c83aea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Shadur","original_name":"Dan Shadur","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a27278b9ebd6e0ca25aede","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shakked Auerbach","original_name":"Shakked Auerbach","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a27261eac1fab882467c85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2351259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Itzik Cohen","original_name":"Itzik Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a272ebfdb522a3545d36cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4285560,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yossi Ollech","original_name":"Yossi Ollech","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a272deca23087b4acf886f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shakked Auerbach","original_name":"Shakked Auerbach","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a27259f7a114a083e101db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32856753","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d3KP1OjaPuOPPCDtync14KcQUNS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jerusalem Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
