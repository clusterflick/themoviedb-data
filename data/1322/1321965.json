He arrives to find the town abandoned years ago by everyone, leaving their houses to slowly crumble into memory, in search of better opportunities. Yet, one resident remains. An eccentric and wild man who has chosen to live alone in nature, to protect the remains of the village from the pillagers that often drive by in search of valuable artefacts. Their encounter will force Christian to confront his father's identity and perhaps finally understand why his father was the way he was.","popularity":0.4102,"poster_path":"/9oX83rnI8poFfwPB3pMQW1na0DD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Remnants
