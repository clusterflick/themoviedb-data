In this documentary Te Pahū, composer Hirini Melbourne (ONZM) and ethnologist Te Warena Taua trace the history of pahū, from musical accompaniment to being the manawa (heart) of communication and communities. Musicians and carvers bring to life the lost beat of pahū by creating a version using modern techniques. Pioneering Māori filmmaker Merata Mita (Patu!) directed Te Pahū, while Rawiri Paratene (Whale Rider) co-wrote and produced it.","popularity":0.2049,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":234854,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rangipai Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":31727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ora
