Unfolding entirely in te reo Māori, the narrative follows a child (played by Te Ratauhina Tumarae) learning the origins to the waiata 'Taku Rākau E', from her great-grandmother (Menu Ripia). Flicking between the present day and 1873, the great-grandmother tells how Mihikitekapua, a blind women of Tūhoe (also played by Ripia), first sang this important waiata. Rangihau was mentored by prominent filmmaker Merata Mita, who produced the film with co-producer Chelsea Winstanley.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":234856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stanstrong","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New
