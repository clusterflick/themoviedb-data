Later, Bradley's father is suspected of rustling cattle, but he denies the charge. As the romance develops between Bradley and Sybil, Bradley comes upon a rustler at work and is about to shoot when he discovers his own father, who claims he is victim of a hereditary taint that he cannot subdue. Some friends, who observe the incident, rustle some of Blatchford's cattle, mark it with Sybil's brand, and accuse her of rustling and hiding some dark secret. She confesses that her brother disgraced the family, and when George learns of it, he is forgiven and is reunited with her.","popularity":0.2715,"poster_path":"/cbhoEJmXWlE0X52nP7GYa3h5Cgn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Drama of Love, Hate and justice in the Cattle Country.","title":"Rustlin' for Cupid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George O'Brien","original_name":"George O'Brien","popularity":0.5295,"profile_path":"/kW0JfbSCb6RzHvZEtBDzGuvzqIr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bradley Blatchford","credit_id":"66a295f0f1439d9851a0cef0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1393409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Stewart","original_name":"Anita Stewart","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/kKJmhV2idh4ybNn8869HxsMO37y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sybil Hamilton","credit_id":"66a2960cd69b309e2b05f9fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Simpson","original_name":"Russell Simpson","popularity":0.2131,"profile_path":"/sZAJ7TS52RxyejiirXhhqmYxxwn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hank Blatchford","credit_id":"66a2962ef1439d9851a0cef4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Yorke","original_name":"Edith Yorke","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":"/k7pal8IQcwkw3A0JQ8w6rpD9vP2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Blatchford","credit_id":"66a29646a1fe12003672da1c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Prior","original_name":"Herbert Prior","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/wN0WTT9TqPt6JvI5JsnGhp2yoMN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Martin","credit_id":"66a2965fe85279d0b3cf89cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank McGlynn Jr.","original_name":"Frank McGlynn Jr.","popularity":0.1518,"profile_path":"/cuL5EfAmW7iKZJuj3Ns9xJ7NjA9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dave Martin","credit_id":"66a29689b241a108a4ca7ebe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1097472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Jordan","original_name":"Sid Jordan","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/kvnhDr72SuFItTvjOrMK5poJiOx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jack Mason","credit_id":"66a2969c8dd96825c62666a4","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irving Cummings","original_name":"Irving Cummings","popularity":0.5663,"profile_path":"/jHkEJn2HRhGEtfQ2S8L7fTBWcz9.jpg","credit_id":"66a296bcf8f9b2a3f314dbbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96772,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter B.
