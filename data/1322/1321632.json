The book cherrypicked Reid's favourites from the renaissance in local movies that began with Sleeping Dogs in 1977. Reid and a who’s who of local filmmakers discuss many of the 50+ features from the previous decade (with Bruno Lawrence ever present). They ponder the uniqueness (or otherwise) of Kiwi film. A fondness for rural and small town settings, and forceful, often conflicted, male leads is explored. Neglected areas — Māori film and more of a voice for women — are traversed.","popularity":0.1037,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":234858,"logo_path":null,"name":"BCNZ","origin_country":""},{"id":1254,"logo_path":"/yaecijXtiF2mKiDoxDBOVffJmOC.png","name":"Television New Zealand","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1987-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"NZ Cinema, the Past Decade","title":"Kaleidoscope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merata Mita","original_name":"Merata Mita","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/t9D9XASTbaHkZ7ySgFF0KH3vTNB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a336c8fd5d5c9bfeddc20e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Donaldson","original_name":"Roger Donaldson","popularity":0.5496,"profile_path":"/qh19qXD1JpFSNhRKtg2vm9nDTwY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a336da95bbae847e38619c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15289,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Barnett","original_name":"John Barnett","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a336e75731d285840a2f52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoff Murphy","original_name":"Geoff Murphy","popularity":0.2207,"profile_path":"/AtNod4v6Nzq9wXKXejIiOn4TAsW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a336fa98d5450835e8183c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135275,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Parr","original_name":"Larry Parr","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a337059e75fdd0c9268384","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaylene Preston","original_name":"Gaylene Preston","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/u3jQ734Us6tubvgd4dvFIgdk85P.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a337115301d17f8dddc604","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Reynolds","original_name":"Don Reynolds","popularity":0.1635,"profile_path":"/jo1IGZgwGv1Qp6cTrAU7oRSUCzZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a3371d3f96cef506ca9a0d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Ward","original_name":"Vincent Ward","popularity":0.1302,"profile_path":"/wB7WbhfrcJQl1nc0AbCjJ26d1eE.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Subject","credit_id":"66a3372ae455b7e8af1900b6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850224,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denis Harvey","original_name":"Denis Harvey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a336821ed399d64583d092","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850225,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alison Parr","original_name":"Alison Parr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a336a311d677d930267e28","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850226,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernie Wright","original_name":"Bernie Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a336b534a0e6530da0e7c4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850223,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Allan Honey","original_name":"Allan Honey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a336729e1ee29ee6061792","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Taylor","original_name":"Howard Taylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a33666fccfec06dc614206","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850227,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicholas Reid","original_name":"Nicholas Reid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a337916c788470f3eea36b","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
