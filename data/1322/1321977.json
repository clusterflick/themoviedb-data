The secret of Astakhov’s success is a unique combination of artistic intuition with the talent of an engineer-inventor. The film shows Astakhov in a variety of manifestations: on the set, and during the construction of his house, and during the construction of a chapel, and at a children's Christmas party. And everywhere he is invariably charming with his energy and love of life!","popularity":0.1105,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Сергей Астахов, или Механика киноискусства","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sergey Astakhov, ili Mekhanika kinoiskusstva","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324503,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Astakhov","original_name":"Сергей Астахов","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/pwXiKPEpCyH3GrrgEEm68jy47nz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"66a4c74329f1cd56ca7c1007","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1951466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Lando","original_name":"Sergey Lando","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yH5xoFyrnNkoAEqG0hl7Qps45aJ.jpg","credit_id":"66a4c74ee6e27c9dd8ad6d8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1951466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Lando","original_name":"Sergey Lando","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yH5xoFyrnNkoAEqG0hl7Qps45aJ.jpg","credit_id":"66a4c751d3dc1be01487cd8f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
