A series of interviews and performances with the chosen few that came in contact with the late Joe Cole’s mighty video 8 camera.\r This video is as much about Joe as it is about the people that he filmed. Joe was able to make people feel comfortable enough to let themselves go in front of his lens. I used to watch the raw footage of Joe’s hours of interview footage culled from walking the streets of cities all over. I was constantly amazed at his ability to find these totally unique people. When you watch this you will see what I’m talking about. Reminds me of a quote I have heard over the years, something that amounts to those who can see it (in) others must have some of it in themselves.","popularity":0.4309,"poster_path":"/pkHdjFHmLagrmY6iaGEAMj21uvj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77091,"logo_path":null,"name":"2.13.61 Produtions","origin_country":""},{"id":234784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Modivation Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God’s Movie Volume 1","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cole","original_name":"Joe Cole","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/ey6tL54KNw4AjzFkryCTryfe5ed.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66a1c2f9665f08a3063840cd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cole","original_name":"Joe Cole","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/ey6tL54KNw4AjzFkryCTryfe5ed.jpg","credit_id":"66a1d9c34fa0c0b4266e83f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pkHdjFHmLagrmY6iaGEAMj21uvj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":154950,"name":"venice beach, california"},{"id":177927,"name":"homeless"},{"id":335345,"name":"street people"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"God's Movie - Joe Cole","key":"PhGxVfh9lag","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2009-07-24T01:37:39.000Z","id":"66a1d8484744d378240a0fda"}]}}}
