One day, when she opens her refrigerator, she finds something creepy inside. On the other hand, David, her 18-year-old brother, doesn't see anything out of the ordinary inside, so he helps her take out two eggs to make a cake. David leaves the house and Olivia begins to prepare her recipe, when she accidentally knocks over an egg and it breaks. Olivia must overcome her fear of what is inside the refrigerator in order to cook the cake she needs. This story talks about how we deal with our fears day by day and how we can't run away from them, it's better to face them.","popularity":0.0933,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the fridge","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4848485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matilda Valenzuela","original_name":"Matilda Valenzuela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"66a1ec8ce225e242da14d9ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Torres","original_name":"Santiago Torres","popularity":0.193,"profile_path":"/vlT3tVuOtJzgg2awJF6zfz8FLdj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hermano","credit_id":"66a1eca249fec7422680efd7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798516,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Metch De la Paz","original_name":"Metch De la Paz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2XQEsI0muvfTDsB7JthnQjPd7gl.jpg","credit_id":"66a1ecefaee67cba37dd9e0b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4848442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabella Conconi","original_name":"Isabella Conconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dtJOlRo6zvGbykvjqW6XaazS70j.jpg","credit_id":"66a1ecb049fec7422680efdb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4848442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabella Conconi","original_name":"Isabella Conconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dtJOlRo6zvGbykvjqW6XaazS70j.jpg","credit_id":"66a1ecc7f9e84c7a450886cd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4848442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabella Conconi","original_name":"Isabella Conconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dtJOlRo6zvGbykvjqW6XaazS70j.jpg","credit_id":"66a1ecba8904c8d959708c2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4009866,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel Belmont","original_name":"Michel Belmont","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/A2QSXAgdXdgUlTQaM6lMeDv5nnC.jpg","credit_id":"66a1ed03e296d3a52418ea07","department":"Sound","job":"Assistant Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4743086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofía García Galán","original_name":"Sofía García Galán","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mEqmEXyj1WUqEYeeFxsuQVjjojX.jpg","credit_id":"66a1ece2c5e20d62a818ed43","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4848442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabella Conconi","original_name":"Isabella Conconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dtJOlRo6zvGbykvjqW6XaazS70j.jpg","credit_id":"66a711ca82928f140eb3112b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4867113,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jose Arturo García","original_name":"Jose Arturo García","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66afe8251411db4b983a078e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4009866,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel Belmont","original_name":"Michel Belmont","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/A2QSXAgdXdgUlTQaM6lMeDv5nnC.jpg","credit_id":"66afe7fe626ec09ec139fa73","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1384,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hLBFc6UOK8uFOywaQAelJYi3yun.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2460}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
