One of the film's main characters is a chaplain, a current priest of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, Dmytro Povorotnyi. He invites musicians with guitars to travel to military locations in Donbas. The entire musical tour led by the chaplain takes place in one day. The chaplain and the musicians are accompanied by a film crew from Suspilne Culture.  The film, which was supposed to tell about a New Year's Eve volunteer trip to the military in the grey zone, became a story about mercy, understanding of need and help as a state.","popularity":0.3247,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":154771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suspilne Media","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary about the New Year's holidays of soldiers in Donbas","title":"Vertep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"},{"id":260917,"name":"ukrainian culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
