In 2023 he would have turned one hundred years old. He died before reaching eighty. His screenwriting works include “July Rain” by Marlen Khutsiev and “St. Petersburg Secrets,” one of the first Russian television series; “Success” with Leonid Filatov, “Prokhindiada, or Running in Place” with Alexander Kalyagin, “Diary of a School Principal” with Oleg Borisov. He worked with Yuliy Raizman and Anatoly Efros, and left our time with a living and relevant “Diary of the Last Screenwriter.” The peculiarity of Grebnev’s fate is that he came to cinema only in the middle of his life - as an adult, mature person. His childhood, youth and youth were full of hopes and failures, love and loss. The film will tell not only about Grebnev’s film biography, but also about that first life that he left for the sake of cinema.","popularity":0.2148,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":23343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Passenger Pictures Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Жизнь Анатолия Гребнева","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Zhizn Anatoliya Grebneva","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88489,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anatoli Grebnev","original_name":"Анатолий Гребнев","popularity":0.1435,"profile_path":"/c2FjDG9OhYo6LcjevTPrF1eiLm7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67e0642830e65e7beec73032","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandr Rodionov","original_name":"Александр Родионов","popularity":0.1604,"profile_path":"/hBny8VgJX9qm7sSCoKivQB1K1si.jpg","credit_id":"66a4c821d5d39d81c06008d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandr Rodionov","original_name":"Александр Родионов","popularity":0.1604,"profile_path":"/hBny8VgJX9qm7sSCoKivQB1K1si.jpg","credit_id":"66a4c8255e236beb57c62d24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4851914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizaveta Kozlova","original_name":"Elizaveta Kozlova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a4c838dbf853693b9124e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
