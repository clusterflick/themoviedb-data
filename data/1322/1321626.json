With a focus on their personal lives, these highly accomplished wahine Māori are generous in sharing what motivates and challenges them in their mahi — with friendship a recurring theme. Filmed a year after the disbanding of her group Moana and the Moahunters, Maniapoto is particularly vulnerable in her reflections. The film was made by Honours student Sam Cruickshank as part of a Film and Media Studies degree at Auckland University.","popularity":0.3839,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":232389,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Auckland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1999-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the end you realise money, fame — all those things are nothing if you don't have your health.","title":"Pākiri: The Filmmaker, the Cook & the Singer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Thorp","original_name":"Anne Thorp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66a32e46e73c652f99d4f859","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merata Mita","original_name":"Merata Mita","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/t9D9XASTbaHkZ7ySgFF0KH3vTNB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66a32e56bffb534f84e11cc4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moana Maniapoto","original_name":"Moana Maniapoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66a32e643c8e8b5b8c14f764","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Cruickshank","original_name":"Sam Cruickshank","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a32ec4a9212776c5e117b2","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Cruickshank","original_name":"Sam Cruickshank","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a32eb7f8f9b2a3f314f6f6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Cruickshank","original_name":"Sam Cruickshank","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a32e7ac4e63bdb74e11b4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Cruickshank","original_name":"Sam Cruickshank","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a32e81e85279d0b3cfa482","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
