With different rules for different cultures. Solo and teams. Tournaments. For money on the table. Six dots, nine dots. But what is consistent is the loud trash talking across the tables, the slamming down of “bones,” the strategy of predicting what the next player has in their hand. Throwing Bones. Caribbean Chess.
