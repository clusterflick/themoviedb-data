- Vita accidentale di un anarchico","overview":"It was the night between December 15 and 16, 1969, when railwayman, anarchist and partisan Giuseppe Pinelli, known as “Pino,” died at the age of 41 after falling from a window of the Milan police headquarters, where he was being held for investigation after a bomb exploded at the Banca Nazionale dell’Agricoltura in Milan: now the documentary goes in search of the man, the husband and the father, with his ideas, his passions, his affections--starting from that fateful 1969 and arriving at 2009, when President Giorgio Napolitano called him “the 18th victim of the Piazza Fontana massacre.”","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":"/5JNzA0diAjuxM5Z4Kg7HV4fGh29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghiro
