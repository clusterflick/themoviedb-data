But the Germans counter-attacked and the result of the battle was a virtual draw, with the front lines shifting slightly. However, the battle of Cambrai marked a major turning point in the course of the war - and military history as a whole.The era of trench warfare was coming to an end and technology was beginning to reign supreme on the battlefields of Europe.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/rqbTTy0EbL3J5uee8sg2XBd4d2b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Line of Fire: Cambrai 1917","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rqbTTy0EbL3J5uee8sg2XBd4d2b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
