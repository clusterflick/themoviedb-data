In a playful mix with the movement of light and the detail of the room, we travel around the whole house. With quiet movements we take a walk through the library's familiar and unfamiliar rooms from basement to loft. The film is a tribute to the library as a meeting place for everyone.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/7p1EI0dadWIiulL1SqDBu3ovtI8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrett av en bygning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1555552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hilde Malme","original_name":"Hilde Malme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e853fc0cb6db50018a8f8d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1555552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hilde Malme","original_name":"Hilde Malme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e853fd05aba320018e68c09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1555552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hilde Malme","original_name":"Hilde Malme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e853fd5da10f00014ed9b12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1555552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hilde Malme","original_name":"Hilde Malme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e853fdb3344c600173fe9c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586483,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"H책kon Iversen","original_name":"H책kon Iversen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e853fed3344c600173fea07","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586483,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"H책kon Iversen","original_name":"H책kon Iversen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e853ff4da10f00016ed798f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1PMaWribJaUEXB485wJVaDjUXyE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/7p1EI0dadWIiulL1SqDBu3ovtI8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
