Considered by many to be a legendary figure of the Sardinian tradition, in reality he acted until the 1960s, as our protagonists, eyewitnesses of the deeds of the ladies of the good death, tell.  Together with them we cross the sunny landscapes of Sardinia and immerse ourselves in the shaded areas of a millenary culture still alive in the present.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/zrtFq7XTHYJkeE2Tsqc4kd7OlN4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Sardinian","iso_639_1":"sc","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An old woman who used to practice an ancient form of euthanasia in the Island of Sardinia, Italy","title":"Sa femina accabadora:  La dama della buona morte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pietro Bardanzellu","original_name":"Pietro Bardanzellu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e7425aba320018e5d3bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Carta","original_name":"Anna Carta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e74fcb6db50013a866d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Francesco Mariani","original_name":"Don Francesco Mariani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e75acb6db50013a866e4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gian Paolo Mele","original_name":"Gian Paolo Mele","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e7635294e70015496101","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Maria Saba","original_name":"Giuseppe Maria Saba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e7785aba320016e5ad76","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Turchi","original_name":"Dolores Turchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e7823344c600153f5ff9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donatella Turri","original_name":"Donatella Turri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e7b65aba320014e59f0e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrizio Galatea","original_name":"Fabrizio Galatea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e84e9155294e70015496319","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10506946","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zrtFq7XTHYJkeE2Tsqc4kd7OlN4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visioni dal Mondo 2018","release_date":"2018-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
