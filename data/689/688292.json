It features a wide range of interviews from children who remember the street parties, to the servicemen who remember not having to buy a single drink that day, then there are the POWs for whom a hot bath was all they wanted after years of captivity.  The programme is richly illustrated with archive including a colour film showing the celebrations in London. Other archive films show a grumpy Montgomery taking the surrender of German land forces in northern Germany on May 4.\"","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/inUsMrvXw4EhI4X9ozf1szOYVkS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VE Day: Forever in their Debt","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2017942,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruce Vigar","original_name":"Bruce Vigar","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8370c3383df200171809a6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2017942,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruce Vigar","original_name":"Bruce Vigar","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8370b63344c600122bf10a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11960672","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/inUsMrvXw4EhI4X9ozf1szOYVkS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
