The none’s ignite an explosion of energy punctuated by neon hues, deft musicality, and show-stopping singalongs with male-female harmonies, strutting guitars, wild horn arrangements, and interminable grooves. Touring incessantly over the better part of the last decade, the group has organically animated a movement of devout followers and graced stages at legendary theaters and festivals across the country and abroad.
