Representing the Baroque period is Baby Vivaldi, which presents delicate, delightful performances of such pieces as \"Concerto in D Major, RV93, 1st Movement\" and \"The Four Seasons, Summer, RV269, 1st and 3rd Movements.\" The orchestra's flutes, harps, synths, percussion, and, of course, music boxes offer plenty of musical colors that complement the complex nature of Baroque music perfectly while giving it a distinctly innocent, childlike feel. A charming album, Baby Vivaldi offers many moods and sounds, as well as a creative way to introduce very young children to these timeless melodies.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/zykn51AfJFvBv3gmcQVD91tBFH7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72308,"logo_path":"/uWSAY8ShgVsIdKtWUyav8QfI2nG.png","name":"The Baby Einstein Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Einstein - Baby Vivaldi","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zykn51AfJFvBv3gmcQVD91tBFH7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
