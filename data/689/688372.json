Only 12-year-old Estelle looks at a wall on which the sea is painted. Thibaud, her peer, approaches the girl and pretends he can see the things that no longer exist.

sea.","popularity":0.2148,"poster_path":"/gxNYZNDolceUOBxrU72VdoUVNvg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zürcher Hochschule der
