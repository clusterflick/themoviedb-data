John Cannizzaro is a maker of experimental films and stop-motion animations – working primarily in Super8mm and 16mm film. Exploring such diverse themes as childhood, memory, dreams, religion, and film making, his films blur the boundaries between narrative, documentary, animation, and poetry.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tCbmhFGqvbvmXZcD6K0fpFufgTQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beatrice of 9","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Cannizzaro","original_name":"John Cannizzaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e84e3765aba320014e59bc8","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tCbmhFGqvbvmXZcD6K0fpFufgTQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
