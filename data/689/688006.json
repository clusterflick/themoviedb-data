Well known for mixing disco, pop, rap and reggae into their sound - it was a formula that earned them massive success, going on to sell more than 40 million albums around the world. They were the first act to have UK Number 1 singles in the 70s, 80s and 90s - with six chart topping tracks. Inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, they are the next act to take to the Hyde Park stage, introduced by Jo Whiley and Tony Blackburn.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oU85nhHrpNjQIjQUAdSMIlWtYvr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blondie: BBC Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oU85nhHrpNjQIjQUAdSMIlWtYvr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
