The music starts with a single rhythmic motif, which subsequently multiplies and unfolds into a rich cornucopia of textures including drums, woodwinds, brass and voice. Reich here ramps up the technique already used in his earlier composition Piano Phase: through minor tempo accelerations the musicians almost imperceptibly push their unison out of joint, resulting in a never-ending volley of canons. In the dance, the choreographic complexity was devised in a similar fashion: a single movement phrase serves as the foundation for an infinite number of variations across time and space. When the music stops and the bodies come to a halt, the audience realizes what they have witnessed: a wave of pure dance and pure sound, a vortex of vital energy.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drumming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183882,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker","original_name":"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e85cb165aba320016e6fd5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
