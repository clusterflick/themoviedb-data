Beginning in ancient Lewes on the south coast - where Alfred (the Great) built - the film takes in the impressive Petchworth House, the \"gay boating crowds\" at Henley-on-Thames, some chocolate-box thatched cottages, and the manicured gardens of Heslington Hall near York. The film goes all out to emphasise the painterly beauty of its locations - look out for a clever framing trick towards the end.","popularity":0.0967,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7396,"logo_path":"/jnjLKDfdAfNylfVdybY9370Ybrg.png","name":"Pathe","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Alfred Built","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
