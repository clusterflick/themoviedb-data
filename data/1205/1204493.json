Initially emphasizing counterexamples and directly and sharply drawing the attention of the offenders to the noticed irregularities in their habits or management, the filmmakers conclude their plea by presenting another model bachelor accommodation where cleanliness and neighborly decency replace the disorder and indifference of the former.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Și bune și rele","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
