He re-cut the film as a music video for this song, which he happened to be listening to a lot during the making of the film. Despite the fact it was not an \"official\" video it was named one of the Best Music Videos Of The Decade by Paste Magazine and has met with overwhelming audience approval from more than a million viewers. He went on to be a professional music video director and also currently teaches a class on making music videos at UCLA. This is a brand new restoration and remastering from the original film and video segments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How To Disappear Completely","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
