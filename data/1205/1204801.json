Men, women and children are forced against their will to serve in the sex trade, domestic servitude and agricultural industries. They are bought, sold and discarded in our own community, making Florida the third-highest ranked state in the nation for this fast-growing crime. Join us for an in-depth look at this crisis with TOO CLOSE TO HOME, a WEDU documentary on human trafficking in Tampa Bay. Local law enforcement, service providers and citizens are creating a grass roots movement to help combat this form of modern-day slavery.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Close to Home: Human Trafficking in Tampa Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristine Kelly","original_name":"Kristine Kelly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552b3b39653f613f588fc47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3526358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Too Close to Home - Documentary on South Florida Human Trafficking - Trailer","key":"VZCLqXAF8uE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-01-06T19:21:59.000Z","id":"666850c28ad797129f8b72f5"}]}}}
