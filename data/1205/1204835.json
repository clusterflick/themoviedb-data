The Filipino émigré’s identity is a dynamic one, constantly changing and adapting to one’s adopted community, while at the same time attempting to compromise with one’s responsibilities with their family and with their Filipino culture. This documentary explores the stories of some of these 21st century Filipino émigré who used to be state scholars but have since followed other opportunities abroad. As these friends send a video camera to each other by courier and share their stories, they open up about adulthood and moving away, teasing out larger themes such as the Philippine's labor export economy, nationalism, and internationalism.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/g8hElMgpbJoahGYt5s4XMig1ka.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wherever We May Be","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Ellis Alarilla","original_name":"Adrian Ellis Alarilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552db8c67b61345ce371eb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375474,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sonia Jaranilla","original_name":"Sonia Jaranilla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dc0ffd6fa100c474fcc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoé Ciela Guenne","original_name":"Zoé Ciela Guenne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dbe6fd6fa100fee72d14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Ellis Alarilla","original_name":"Adrian Ellis Alarilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dc1b9653f613f3b7067a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauline M.","original_name":"Pauline M.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dbdad4fe0400e1b1f87c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monette Faner","original_name":"Monette Faner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dc04d4fe04013980db9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat R.","original_name":"Pat R.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dbcafd6fa100e1e45021","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jed Yabut","original_name":"Jed Yabut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552db999653f613f3b70607","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Cardenas","original_name":"Kenneth Cardenas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dbaf9653f613f5892dba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Unsay","original_name":"Joseph Unsay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dba3ea84c710959c39d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4375464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Ellis Alarilla","original_name":"Adrian Ellis Alarilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552dbf567b61345cf041f59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g8hElMgpbJoahGYt5s4XMig1ka.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
