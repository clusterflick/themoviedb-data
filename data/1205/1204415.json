No one goes outside except one little girl who wants to water the apple tree because that's what she does every day. As she walked with her red rubber boots and yellow watering can, she also noticed various apples that seemed to be dripping from the heavy rain. She approached the tree and watered it with great love, even though she came back drenched and with a watering can full of rain.” The apples symbolize all the dancers who appear on the screen. Like every apple, every dancer has a history, special look, and style.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Help It Grow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4373142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elly Naigla","original_name":"Elly Naigla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6551a5e10816c700c3d98dea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
