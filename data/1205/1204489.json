Produced at the request of the Institute of Hygiene and Public Health in collaboration with the Red Cross, the documentary criticizes the lack of initiative and civic attitude among the city's residents, who do not consider themselves personally responsible for maintaining cleanliness in public spaces. A health patrol admonishes negligent passersby, inspects vacant lots and wasteland in neighborhoods and the city center—unhealthy places overrun by garbage and household waste. Beyond the unaesthetic appearance, these areas constitute potential infection hotspots in urban clusters. The film concludes with an optimistic picture in which the cleanliness of the city is restored with the participation of all residents, from the young to the old.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pe străzile orașului","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
