Basilico’s lens turns everyday objects such as chimneys, electricity cables and a telephone pole into aesthetic objects. His work lends aesthetic qualities to places and objects that would not otherwise possess them. A view that was far ahead of its time. Today, industrial heritage is automatically understood to possess value.
