Set against the backdrop of the emerging residential areas, the film's narrative structure retains the spirit of socialist realism but is strongly influenced by the optimism and cosmopolitanism of the 1960s. Accompanied by rhythmic swing tunes, we follow the characters of this documentary, representatives of the working class, both at their workplaces and in the new, bright and airy apartments, integrated into the logic and aesthetics of the new socialist neighborhood.","popularity":0.2345,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":155806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul \"Alexandru Sahia\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cartierul nostru","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4373410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Petrovici","original_name":"Jean Petrovici","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6551fae40816c70137e73dc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190284,"name":"socialists"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"1963-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
