The crimes of the German colonial rulers went down in history as the first genocide of the 20th century. The Afro-German presenter and influencer Aminata Belli travels to the African country to investigate the extent to which the legacy of the German colonial era affects the present day of Namibian society. She pays particular attention to the involvement of the Protestant Church in the subjugation of the indigenous people and the sense of guilt of the descendants of the German settlers as well as the Germans themselves. To do this, the fashion journalist interviews various people on site and pretends to be interested in the following questions: Were the missionaries of the time guilty? How does a country heal when horrific things have happened there? And is reconciliation possible?","popularity":0.3648,"poster_path":"/23uooG7uW77Mf4TUCxkE99hrDr2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eikon Media GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deutsche Schuld – Namibia und der Völkermord","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Namibia - What Has Hurt You?
