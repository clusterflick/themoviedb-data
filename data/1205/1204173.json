William has to finally introduce his longtime girlfriend to his Chinese-Filipino parents. They decide to do the meet and greet over lunch at his parents’ home. Simple. Except his parents don’t know he’s been dating a white woman for the past three years. But then the universe intervenes. In a Groundhog Day scenario, right when the family meeting collapses, William and McKenzie reawaken to the car ride to the parents’ home. They’re blessed with unlimited do-overs. Unfortunately, they may be stuck in racist parent hell. Fortunately, they have infinite chances to reflect on what it truly means to earn parents’ approval and what it means to love authentically.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grounded","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whit K.
