Using the frame rate as a way to create rhythmic interconnections between sound and image, the stop-motion animation oscillates between 6 and 48 frames per seconds. The sounds of this work were created and edited in direct relation to the flow of the image.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/y4Dp8aipoeC2lMduS8G32JWUODD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghostly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2309840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxime Corbeil-Perron","original_name":"Maxime Corbeil-Perron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552af16d4fe0400c4204eb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3286496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":993,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y4Dp8aipoeC2lMduS8G32JWUODD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":659}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
