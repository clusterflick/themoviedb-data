The film captures the playful, comedic tone, and the rather low moralizing level, functioning as an allegory of modern urban life. It suggests that the only solution to get a good nap, despite the neighbors' screams and the noise from honking horns and car engines, is sometimes to pull the blanket over your face (or ears) as tightly as possible and plunge into a parallel dreamlike universe.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liniște","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
