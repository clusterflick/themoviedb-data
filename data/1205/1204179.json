When Neel decides to transition from his assigned gender at birth he is rendered homeless having to leave his parental home. But does he find the expected/promised shelter in his affirmed gender? Does he find familiarity in his chosen-lived life? Beyond the blues is a journey of breaking and unmaking binaries, never quite settling down in the comfort of borders and categorizations. It is the story of finding love and resilience in quiet corners, feline kinships, and vibrant colors of the rainbow. It is a promise to hold hands, walk in strength and solidarity, to facilitate newer journeys.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6TUcJC5zG7jiSQaayGzmT98dhvH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debalina Majumder","original_name":"Debalina Majumder","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65513331ea84c710959b413b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30577399","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rU0Gz6hExn52j3EDaqXoSlJzPO3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6TUcJC5zG7jiSQaayGzmT98dhvH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul Human Right Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
