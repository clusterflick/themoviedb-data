Harshita gets a second chance after the death of her husband when she meets Sridhar, a writer, who treats her with kindness and respect. The film brings out the conflict surrounding such relationships and is an ode to love and the power it holds to transform someone’s life. It explores how abuse is common, accepted and normalised within patriarchy, leaving a deep shattering impact on womanhood. It delves into how love holds the power to liberate anyone who is subjugated to abuse with a message to liberate and empower women.","popularity":0.2962,"poster_path":"/3fjbx9xt4iVitVceB7XD18LXs0p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dhai Aakhar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1168524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mrinal Kulkarni","original_name":"Mrinal Kulkarni","popularity":0.3297,"profile_path":"/ieSjGEhHK5DlRO8XGEstQBmhFWl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harshita","credit_id":"65621a82a6c104013829dfe6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4380690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Praveen Arora","original_name":"Praveen Arora","popularity":0.1001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655664d5d4fe04011b91d51c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m7NmlBXeUl5kvirm4R6qk5iEtW8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3fjbx9xt4iVitVceB7XD18LXs0p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
