Incomplete Sentences is a feature documentary on her literature and life, leading to exile in Frankfurt, after the Turkish regime’s oppression results in her unlawful imprisonment. Now, she struggles in exile while everybody is waiting for her to write again. Right after getting out of prison Aslı starts telling her story to the director, wandering in the streets of Istanbul she recites parts from her books and explains the stories behind. When Aslı goes to Germany to receive the Erich Maria Remarque Award she cannot return; thus her exile, which she likens to a semi-open prison, begins. As her health deteriorates and keeps her from writing, the tragedy in her books becomes her own reality.","popularity":0.3617,"poster_path":"/opJGWGGaxS2wIavTDDMJveGsloR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213455,"logo_path":null,"name":"integral film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2022-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incomplete Sentences","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aslı Erdoğan","original_name":"Aslı Erdoğan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7sEaZToJgMjTrAyHVHFyIAluz3R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"herself","credit_id":"65524fa5fb529900e30a865f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"adar bozbay","original_name":"adar bozbay","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"director","credit_id":"65525093fb529900ad7ad1f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Necmiye Alpay","original_name":"Necmiye Alpay","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"herself","credit_id":"655257cefb5299011d95ef80","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3211119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehmet Atak","original_name":"Mehmet Atak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"himself","credit_id":"65525983ea84c71093ff0051","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jørgen Lorentzen","original_name":"Jørgen Lorentzen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655250deea84c71093fefcb0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"adar bozbay","original_name":"adar bozbay","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552504d0816c7011a0a31d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"adar bozbay","original_name":"adar bozbay","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655250b30816c700fd2e697a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636384,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Burak Dal","original_name":"Burak Dal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655251770816c700abbb1200","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melek Bal","original_name":"Melek Bal","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65525115903c5200e1ef1f7b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"adar bozbay","original_name":"adar bozbay","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655254f8ea84c7109225d901","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374146,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alper Çağan Arslan","original_name":"Alper Çağan Arslan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655251c90816c700e017ab83","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636380,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Koray Kesik","original_name":"Koray Kesik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662bd2715c071b011e5ec154","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29950339","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bSRMhF9GViPJQvVbXB4I2nNLMdg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2822,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opJGWGGaxS2wIavTDDMJveGsloR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1563,"name":"prisoner"},{"id":1721,"name":"fight"},{"id":13028,"name":"writer"},{"id":33640,"name":"democracy"},{"id":163119,"name":"injustice"},{"id":180220,"name":"kurdistan"},{"id":190066,"name":"kurdish"},{"id":228489,"name":"racial injustice"},{"id":229952,"name":"kurd"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Incomplete Sentences -
