It had been thought Timo Salonen would lead the Peugeot team to another win. However, he was eclipsed by a brilliant drive from the former world champion. Nevertheless, Salonen and the Peugeot are established as the champions for 1985. This video graphically illustrates the hazards the drivers had to face, not least being the huge clouds of dust and the almost suicidally reckless spectators who were nearly as dangerous as the notorious crowds in Portugal.  The Lancias made a welcome comeback and added colour to an event, which turned out more a test of stamina than predicted. Rohrl can be seen hurling the big Quattro through the mountains sometimes defying the laws of gravity in his urgency to see off the little French turbos. On the gravel or tarmac, San Remo belonged to Rohrl. See how he did it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/90s6F6mNIE8TXZuiEhFMuh3Zs4q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rallye Sanremo 1985","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4NtNGrDeZKPokNPe9PKc9uLSkv7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s4oYFVVDzPErJ4L6Bi8OVRVPxLM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/90s6F6mNIE8TXZuiEhFMuh3Zs4q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
