On the other hand, the film presents the policy of replacing the old shanties and unhealthy spaces with spacious blocks, sometimes handing the microphone to the residents of Calea Moșilor to express their opinions about the benefits of the architectural plan for the area. For instance, artist Anda Călugăreanu sings a gentle song, accompanied by a guitar and her daughter.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calea Moșilor, trecut și prezent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
