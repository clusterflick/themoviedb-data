Equal parts Carl Sagan and William Blake, this flicker film is composed of tens of thousands of individual retinal photographs from public scientific databases. Its flickering landscapes evoke the violence of the big bang and balance somewhere between threat and seduction, like the paintings of J.M.W. Turner. Animated between 12 and 24 frames per second, they make for a dazzling rush into the maelstrom of life as we perceive it.","popularity":0.2739,"poster_path":"/oa8EVftz6u2rXxWyGN6uhh9f6PL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ten minutes of eye contact may lead to hallucinations.","title":"Immaculate Generations no. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3073970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vito A.
