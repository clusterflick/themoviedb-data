In this piece, Villaverde intertwines these two nocturnal worlds, populated by fights, death, and trouble, as if in a dance. Tac칩n is based on a text by Jorge Luis Borges that reflects on tango and, with the poetry of its words, traces a reflection on the passage of time and death. Borges gave several lectures on tango in his native Buenos Aires. The genre fascinated him, as it was a portal to the dark and violent Buenos Aires that had so inspired his verses and prose. A prevailing darkness and tension pervade the visual vision of Tac칩n, accentuated, also, by the music of the Argentinian Astor Piazzolla.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Villaverde","original_name":"Xavier Villaverde","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6903ddc017ba9137b9196b2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
