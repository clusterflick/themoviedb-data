But the filmmakers aim to dispel this notion and try to unravel a new mystery from the star's life. Forty years after Marilyn Monroe's death, a suitcase belonging to the famous actress was auctioned in Los Angeles. It had been stored for all these years among unclaimed items in a New York storage facility. The suitcase was purchased by an eccentric and passionate collector—Princess Tenko, a Japanese magician. A well-known and popular figure in Japan, she is willing to spend vast sums to buy items such as a toothbrush, underwear, or a dress that once belonged to Norma Jean Baker.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xVgfn4zqTU9fgMYQYgPHOkr8wRd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118532,"logo_path":"/qIS5ipEl4QfF1z1o3Dwy19Kqfe9.png","name":"Upside Télévision","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marilyn Monroe: Unclaimed Baggage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Unrevealed Story of Marilyn's Last Trunk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilyn Monroe","original_name":"Marilyn Monroe","popularity":1.6913,"profile_path":"/vcp6rHL2sZWdlJQDEWsEe0jAAe1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"690355161e0724a343b9b6fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe DiMaggio","original_name":"Joe DiMaggio","popularity":1.3159,"profile_path":"/p5rGkPvRcDbpr8P6rDKMWaIrMnv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6903552644e830bd4509ce81","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Miller","original_name":"Arthur Miller","popularity":0.9771,"profile_path":"/ttjDqWZkHbAWImK2yZq06UFWBVq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"690355366f4845c4058fed0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Vanderbilt","original_name":"Gloria Vanderbilt","popularity":0.8035,"profile_path":"/p0x571cA8O5nnVbfIqWOTWVlRIR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6903554169166d0fe79a7bde","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Robin","original_name":"Antoine Robin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69035590935a8b47e634ccc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5772168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1389,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xVgfn4zqTU9fgMYQYgPHOkr8wRd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":926},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1389,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3MlYqqx5vqikGTq4TwzPjgRIKeV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":926}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
