And she wasn't the first. For centuries, people across continents and cultures have been fascinated by this ancient totem animal, one of the largest mammals in the northern hemisphere. Whereas in the past they wanted to conquer it, today they tend to listen to it. The director's cinematic odyssey is the result of several years of searching for the secrets of the moose. It leads from Czech forests through a Russian domestication station to the territory of the indigenous peoples of Canada. A collage of stories told from personal, spiritual, and scientific perspectives shows the moose as a guide between worlds, a symbol of balance and renewal, and a possible answer to the question of how we can heal our relationship with nature.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5o0Vn46JFMl1lT4rZD7sG0addtd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AMOOSED: a moose odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5782729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hana Nováková","original_name":"Hana Nováková","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69026f71ff76296cd48519a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":796,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5o0Vn46JFMl1lT4rZD7sG0addtd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
