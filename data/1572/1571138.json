Tomorrow is a pivotal day: Arasi has her long-awaited online concert, Azhaghu has an important job interview, and Bhoomi faces a test at school. Azhaghu calls his parents, Thillai and Mohana, for support to manage these overlapping events.  The next day, Thillai and Mohana arrive, and the family's routine takes center stage as they navigate the challenges of the day. The narrative zooms in on their small yet significant moments as we await the outcomes. Through these ordinary yet intense experiences, the story explores the family's dynamics, and how these everyday events shape their futures.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lfMfRE2NQWeiryaTYk7c9ao2qQL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278812,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neosapien Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Equal","title":"Equal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vaibhav Murugesan","original_name":"Vaibhav Murugesan","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Azhaghu","credit_id":"690246c7d500277117ee79e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5782370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madhuvanthi","original_name":"Madhuvanthi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Arasi","credit_id":"690246d73f9ce4a5be3d4125","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5782372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samathmika","original_name":"Samathmika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bhoomi","credit_id":"690246e5402a3252b37e7938","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3985887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Subramanian Madhavan","original_name":"Subramanian Madhavan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/iVaSRmemLr34HHKczMj2pCtQAWK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Thillai","credit_id":"690247002cb9e9f4c5a7dc2c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5782373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharmila Thirumalaisamy","original_name":"Sharmila Thirumalaisamy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mohana","credit_id":"690247240564af4c72c5644e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268239,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naren Elan","original_name":"Naren Elan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6902473c9a1d38dcd23d411e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5782374,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shiva Prasad","original_name":"Shiva Prasad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69024756d20b755dc2a2c117","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4047840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raghav Ramesh","original_name":"Raghav Ramesh","popularity":0.2617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69024796500fe150e8a7dc2c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5782374,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shiva Prasad","original_name":"Shiva Prasad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6902481469a13ab32aaf11e7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5782374,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shiva Prasad","original_name":"Shiva Prasad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6902482989c7ab92e1a7dc2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ojKDqimQRyeyl5SGzmNMpA2KHNc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pZYoBrQOMXeAg7iMn4sP9sl9Fi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ga4I8hskFVUut55ADf749F6kwOx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tueBja471fmystp121eMwpI0c4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRfioTzFBjWMYv3C05UUIXPwBYe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hiHuuG0APLoxQRyFBomjz4yvzoG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.241,"height":1142,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6EpRJEVuIHfRXcRbpHsFlI5apoa.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2559},{"aspect_ratio":2.647,"height":2947,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gyUCZRsmTD7S7Yo1n1Rf567heU1.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":7800}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_3166_1":"IN","iso_639_1":"ta","file_path":"/lfMfRE2NQWeiryaTYk7c9ao2qQL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
