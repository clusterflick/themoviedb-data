Trent Har­ris, one of America's strang­est filmmakers, asks this and other per­plex­ing questions in, The Wild Goose Chron­icles. Ban­ished from Holly­wood for the unfor­givable sin of making a flop, Harris sets out for Tim­buk­tu and places even more remote. Powered by lost loves, dead pets, and magic mush­rooms he wanders the world, discovers the \"Giant Eye of Merv\" in Turk­men­istan, naked beauties on the beach in Brazil, and crafty antelope on a bomb­ing range in Utah. It's TRUE, it's WEIRD, and it's on DVD.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/fwpK7IAzjd5PRmAkv3HRsqvB8Ik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four Episodes with Trent Harris","title":"The Wild Goose Chronicles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trent Harris","original_name":"Trent Harris","popularity":0.4185,"profile_path":"/hdsf3okAoWnWvHOVtUmzhghxJj6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69028353ca70931263851a21","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trent Harris","original_name":"Trent Harris","popularity":0.4185,"profile_path":"/hdsf3okAoWnWvHOVtUmzhghxJj6.jpg","credit_id":"690282e17e020d862ba2c24d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trent Harris","original_name":"Trent Harris","popularity":0.4185,"profile_path":"/hdsf3okAoWnWvHOVtUmzhghxJj6.jpg","credit_id":"6902832ef709a594b5ee7b14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trent Harris","original_name":"Trent Harris","popularity":0.4185,"profile_path":"/hdsf3okAoWnWvHOVtUmzhghxJj6.jpg","credit_id":"69028341efcc026dd97e7a58","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":2244,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fwpK7IAzjd5PRmAkv3HRsqvB8Ik.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
