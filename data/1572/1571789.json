Shot and directed by the artist's son and punctuated by extracts of Robert Henri's \"The Art Spirit,\" \"Pilgrim\" explores the act of making art. It asks us to consider how our lives are twisted and shaped by the world around us, and in the process, reintroducing us - even those most estranged from it - to the artist within.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silent Pilgrim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
