On one of those trips, while working as a cleaner in a hotel in the north, the camera turned on itself. Habitante was born from that gesture: an intimate logbook made up of personal archives, fragments of travel, and shared silences. Through a sensitive and fragmented montage, the film explores the resonances between the filmmaker's life and those he encountered along the way, revealing common echoes of migration, uprooting, and searching. More than a portrait of the other, Habitante is a question about how we inhabit the world, about the sometimes impossible desire to belong. Between tenderness and discomfort, between observation and self-exploration, the film becomes an emotional diary that, by looking outward, ends up revealing the inner landscape of the filmmaker.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2025-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habitante","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2793982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Alejandro González Vargas","original_name":"José Alejandro González Vargas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69028e53eb34546ffefe5490","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
