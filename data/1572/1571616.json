Bob also makes an impression on Reed's pretty daughter Betty. The cowboy is so admired by the local citizenry that when crooks J. M. Ballinger and Rufus Berry arrive in town, they decide to make Bob their patsy. After planting oil on Bob's land, they sell stock to the townfolk and the cowboy, who has been innocently drawn into the scheme, turns it over to the crooks for safekeeping. For his efforts, Bob is arrested and found guilty of defrauding the stock holders, and also charged with being notorious outlaw Pat Duncan. After several adventures, Bob succeeds in capturing the real Duncan, vindicates himself of the charges and wins Betty for his bride.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pjtrQ8NN2wytSFcLyPGKk8Dtm7K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Tale of Love, Stunts And Romance","title":"3 Gold Coins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"As Três Moedas de Ouro","type":"Brazilian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Három arany","type":"Hungarian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Slagen till slant","type":"Swedish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mix","original_name":"Tom Mix","popularity":0.968,"profile_path":"/qTaMWapR1sxjk6mdi3tvRsSMNks.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bob Fleming / Bad Pat Duncan","credit_id":"69037e57dd72fb9e7c6b327d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Loomis","original_name":"Margaret Loomis","popularity":0.3099,"profile_path":"/zbOKSFO5nobakcoMmDhFhutVMj4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Betty Reed","credit_id":"69037e731baac52d066b322b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Whitson","original_name":"Frank Whitson","popularity":0.3525,"profile_path":"/nIuQ899b0qIcCZnm93BE0MPrkLd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luther M.
