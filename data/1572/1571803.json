The nucleus is the “Marbella Club” – opened in 1954 by Prince Alfonso zu Hohenlohe, a descendant of the German nobility. His rich, famous club friends enjoy this picturesque setting on the Mediterranean. The insider tip for the nobility, the super-rich and Hollywood stars quickly becomes one of Europe's tourist hotspots. A rapid rise begins, which seems to know no limits thanks to bubbling petrodollars, but then almost fails due to one of Spain's biggest corruption scandals. The focus of the film is the city itself. How did the once insignificant coastal town become a metropolis of the international jet set? How have glamor and scandals shaped the city? How did she maintain her charm and appeal despite profound periods of decline?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yv7BcGLVmTyDD0gUfJYuSlT5AJl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mythos Marbella - Der Traum vom ewigen Sommer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Bienvenue à Marbella !
