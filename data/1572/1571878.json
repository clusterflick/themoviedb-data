Mary Healy, a stenographer who has helped in the search, learns that Mrs. Healy is not her real mother. At the same time, Mary's resemblance to the missing girl leads Mrs. Jaffrey to investigate further and discover that Mary is her daughter. Mary then goes to live in the Jaffrey home, but runs away because of the snobbish attitudes of Mrs. Jaffrey's friends. Henry Martin, a printer's foreman, tells Mrs. Jaffrey of his love for Mary. Mary's mother and foster mother reconcile themselves when they see Mary's happiness over her forthcoming marriage.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl Named Mary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010171","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
