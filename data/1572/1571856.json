Raised in Gloucester to working class parents, an early tragedy shattered a happy childhood and set him on a path of radical resistance. Living deliberately below the poverty line, Ethan's life is not a retreat but a protest against capitalism, war, and ecological collapse. The film explores his convictions, his family's daily rhythms, and the tensions that arise when belief meets the demands of life.","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":"/TbaGU0TBsQVxpAwOUhxWdBvwC1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lifeworld","origin_country":""},{"id":171563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wolftale Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turn Off The Machines","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5785366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph El-Khoury","original_name":"Joseph El-Khoury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6903ec32917bcc8518ec9f69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5785368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhammad Yusuf Khattak","original_name":"Muhammad Yusuf Khattak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6903ec53917bcc8518ec9f72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3303402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Ruefli","original_name":"Jack Ruefli","popularity":1.8963,"profile_path":"/DwD9DwlSvZWX4pMZ0Suj36hAXe.jpg","credit_id":"6903ec5ee9c4f54055e99947","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37028101","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2631,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/TbaGU0TBsQVxpAwOUhxWdBvwC1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
