Months later he was homeless on the island of Corsica, a fugitive wanted by the FBI.  For six years Tyler sent letters to his family, each containing cryptic clues about his condition. Then the letters stopped arriving.  His final letter was found at his last known whereabouts: a remote mountain refuge near Corsica's highest peaks. Alongside that unsent letter was a journal outlining his years living on the run.  Using that journal—Tyler’s own words—and interviews with those who knew him best, Finding Tyler explores the introspective struggle of life as a fugitive.","popularity":0.1148,"poster_path":"/rvHjqOyJjXLMdEElEZyMQugbbnx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Tyler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2733669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Randag","original_name":"David Randag","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a60d44c5c1ef0094a88004","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Brannan","original_name":"Chris Brannan","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a60d243d4d96002e66d22c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2228470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Reichenbach","original_name":"Diana Reichenbach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mtSZKl8l5LaD4RnvFLeJ5yXM7xg.jpg","credit_id":"61a60d363e2ec8009221d03d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rvHjqOyJjXLMdEElEZyMQugbbnx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2021","release_date":"2021-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
