The two hid in the mountains and shared life, death and friendship for 15 days. Finally, they were rescued by a U.S. military helicopter. Ward Millar was repatriated to the United States and Kim Jae-pil was sent by the U.S. military to the U.N. as a prisoner of war as he was dressed as a member of the North Korean People's Army.

Kim Jae-pil and Ward Millar exchanged letters in Korea and the U.S. respectively and shared deep friendships, but at some point, their letters were cut off for unknown reasons.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Name Is Kim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2719833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeong Su-eun","original_name":"Jeong Su-eun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2uQZftuwAGRuMZGwBp4QwFt0OoX.jpg","credit_id":"62f9310d6f53e1007b3895e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":" EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2022-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
