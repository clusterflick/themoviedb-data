Despite the poor conditions, Polly manages to move in good social circles and meets multimillionaire George Singleton and Lieutenant Richard Travers, at the home of Mrs. Madison Derwent. Also at the Derwent mansion is Baron Wootchi, a Japanese diplomat trying to obtain valuable plans that are in Travers' possession. Old Pollard owes Singleton money and tries to persuade his daughter to marry the millionaire. Polly refuses and accepts Travers' proposal instead, until her father informs her that Singleton can seize their house unless Polly pays off the debt by becoming his wife. Meanwhile the Baron offers Pollard $50,000 to produce the documents in Travers' keeping. Pollard steals the papers and goes to a roadhouse to turn them over to the Baron. Discovering the theft, Polly follows and confronts the Baron at gunpoint.","popularity":0.2079,"poster_path":"/kthNwBnHfY6h0bYIwHP1bYKfC0V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yankee Pluck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Clayton","original_name":"Ethel Clayton","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/pEKusLCieVqAOEfRB2CXAtibTeZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Polly Pollard","credit_id":"62f94a981dbc88007c8b159c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2356809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Langford","original_name":"Edward Langford","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lieutenant Richard Travers","credit_id":"62f94aa71dbc88007c8b15a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Hines","original_name":"Johnny Hines","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/zvTdXSM69BPFWhuvH8aMqG7KTti.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lieutenant Tommy Patterson","credit_id":"62f94ab76f53e1007edcc438","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montagu Love","original_name":"Montagu Love","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/aCOahFpYdCKMOg8RO9jMsFOA5xx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Baron Wootchi","credit_id":"62f94ac5258823008220100a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Wayne","original_name":"Eric Wayne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"George Henry Singleton","credit_id":"62f94ae147c9fb0082d2b460","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3663841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Bowser","original_name":"Charles Bowser","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/3QvjIj1ycTAnp7W3mIRl7EWs2ji.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"John Pollard","credit_id":"62f94af19a64350098798e3d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isette Monroe","original_name":"Isette Monroe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Madison Derwent","credit_id":"62f94b001cac8c007a306d08","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Willard Mack","original_name":"Willard Mack","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/eXm5yWoBI7NmVwGs2GZsyMiWAT4.jpg","credit_id":"62f94a8a9a64350098798e1d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Archainbaud","original_name":"George Archainbaud","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/tsqYCt2389uyzFXBpwvTiwxz8zy.jpg","credit_id":"62f94a7f9a6435007a0c5b15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008794","wikidata_id":"Q56322679","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kthNwBnHfY6h0bYIwHP1bYKfC0V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
