Richard Macer infiltrates the endangered world of bells, beer and beards to discover an unlikely saviour of this ancient masculine tradition in the form of women.  The Morris Ring, the oldest Morris organisation in the country, has voted to admit women dancers for the first time with the hope that its member sides - as the teams are called - might stem the tide of declining numbers. But there are hardliners who believe females will dilute the very essence of what makes men’s Morris great. So, is Morris better when danced just by men or are women and mixed sides just as good?","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/h9CtpvwdpcRDETQSESvsHGmVuTW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":102355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Platform Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Folk’s Sake: Morris Dancing and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Macer","original_name":"Richard Macer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self/Presenter","credit_id":"62f840246e938a0091e0d110","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3662907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Macer","original_name":"Richard Macer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f8404a6e938a007a3b0d86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Macer","original_name":"Richard Macer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f840586f53e1007b3849ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h9CtpvwdpcRDETQSESvsHGmVuTW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
