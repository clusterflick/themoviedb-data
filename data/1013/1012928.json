The political situation in the Vienna of 1933 and the fact that Krenek was despised by the Nazis because of this Jazz opera Jonny spielt auf, prevented the premi√®re. It only took place five years later in Prague, however Krenek had already emigrated to the USA. Karl V was the last emperor to hold to the idea of a Christian empire in which the sun never set, although its downfall was always inevitable, for numerous reasons. For the second production of Karl V. in the Nationaltheater, Carlus Padrissa in particular seeks out political power systems that are highly topical, and so very precisely analyses the treatment in the theatrical piece. At the core of the intellectually and linguistically highly qualified libretto, written by the composer himself, Karl V. reflects on his life and makes his confession to a young monk below Titian's La Gloria.","popularity":0.2206,"poster_path":"/hYYjJfTyPLGkTfcmSbxGSyKpViQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Krenek: Karl V","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Skovhus","original_name":"Bo Skovhus","popularity":0.1043,"profile_path":"/wK6k0oyZlMJLqLM9Ew2sQHdgtCO.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Karl V.","credit_id":"645e4ec29590e301438c7248","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1559112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christa Mayer","original_name":"Christa Mayer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9dK2eNDyFAvkmBLOWmzj0Csc2mP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Juana, seine Mutter","credit_id":"62f9ecca175051007f90af5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gun-Brit Barkmin","original_name":"Gun-Brit Barkmin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eleonore, seine Schwester","credit_id":"62f9ecdb1dbc88007f2dc92d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3664393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Power","original_name":"Dean Power","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ferdinand, sein Bruder","credit_id":"62f9ed0a1cac8c00860dffae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schwanewilms","original_name":"Anne Schwanewilms","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Isabella, seine Gattin","credit_id":"62f9ed1948333a00804222e8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3664395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janus Torp","original_name":"Janus Torp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Juan de Regla, sein Beichtvater","credit_id":"62f9ed29175051007c596fa9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630818,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Nielsen","original_name":"Erik Nielsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f9ed6b48333a0083f03f5c","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2304689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlus Padrissa","original_name":"Carlus Padrissa","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/ckDzm68jjHph8VcuvZXSKKyAGC.jpg","credit_id":"62f9ed81e267de007eb898d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayerische Staatsorchester","original_name":"Bayerische Staatsorchester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f9edbabc8abc0084d2b4b1","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chor der Bayerischen Staatsoper","original_name":"Chor der Bayerischen Staatsoper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f9ededbc8abc007fcc66d7","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2596347,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernst Krenek","original_name":"Ernst Krenek","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f9ee42c04429007c856b01","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2596347,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernst Krenek","original_name":"Ernst Krenek","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f9ee501dbc880084518589","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPM6vTPlmTB0Kxs2NTqLVWE3r7P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hyMHGkyBUFYMdGom4TYf5RqYVsg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/phtLY2vOce1LaiwsRb52pPCGuSH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYYjJfTyPLGkTfcmSbxGSyKpViQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":11613,"name":"live broadcast"},{"id":301458,"name":"bayerische staatsoper"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
