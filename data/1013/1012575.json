In a venerable hotel an elevator gets stuck. The pregnant Irene, the receptionist Mia, the janitor Kristof, and the actress Liz are trapped. On a radio they hear the world outside collapsing. As hunger and thirst increase the elevator turns from safe haven to death trap. As they lose hope they let go of built-in defenses and get under each others skin. Kristof and Mia have a common past laden with betrayal and sorrow. Irene is married to a man who abuses her. Liz is torturing herself over the death of a child. Finally Irenes water breaks and there is no alternative but to cut the cable that holds the elevator and plunge towards an unknown fate.","popularity":0.2169,"poster_path":"/zDgeGjoRvhebO6vA6wGxxtPqjdM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beginning of the End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Karim","original_name":"Alexander Karim","popularity":0.6203,"profile_path":"/weqb7jkGhNfdEJsGArbvAqqhuXD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62f9023de323f3008ba721bb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olof Spaak","original_name":"Olof Spaak","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f9024f6e938a0091e1175c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olof Spaak","original_name":"Olof Spaak","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f902586e938a0091e11762","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169550,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ragna Jorming","original_name":"Ragna Jorming","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f90267a313b8009c85bb04","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450145,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hilton Jones","original_name":"Hilton Jones","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f90274a313b8007cf4072c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3382264","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zDgeGjoRvhebO6vA6wGxxtPqjdM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinema at the Edge Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2015-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
