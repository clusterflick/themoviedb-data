It is too early to die no matter how old you are, isn't it? Autumn. An old village in a Belarusian remote place. An elderly man is starting to objectify his fight... The director shows a portrait of the man through revealing his spirit, character, willpower in a single act while leaving the details of his life history off-screen as unnecessary. The action on the screen will provoke the viewer to put themselves in the main character’s shoes inviting them possibly to feel and/or possibly to realise their own lifetime limitation.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/ty5L10VycsLTPegd0cqMBYWIsV5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2014-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"165/60","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Brutski","original_name":"Anton Brutski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f8fdb748333a007b31ea2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4080890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ty5L10VycsLTPegd0cqMBYWIsV5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw Film Festival","release_date":"2014-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"165/60 (trailer)","key":"102135192","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-07-30T14:53:13.000Z","id":"62f8fd64e267de007b6fac17"}]}}}
