Through the lens of a mother raising her 8-year-old son in South East London, the film combines a variety of perspectives and stories from people connected to the issue. The documentary engages with the epidemic on a deeper level and endeavours to ignite further conversations that question both the criminal justice system and the current political climate - all of which point to youth knife crime as a symptom of a wider societal problem.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/83oeLKvvuM0oKi8tXS1ix4ROKi2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something More","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Martins","original_name":"Mary Martins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f7c2c6a313b8009c85619e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21415510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/83oeLKvvuM0oKi8tXS1ix4ROKi2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1066,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6u2WRBI1Scv2RULSNiNn9d282Tj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
