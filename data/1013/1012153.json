Further into this ambiguous opening, and propelled by classical Western opera and symphonic orchestrations, Asian workers are observed putting finishing touches of paint and polish onto gleaming surfaces of what will soon be on display in motorbike showrooms. The images and music are sharply punctuated by the abrupt and raw intrusions of live factory sounds that conclude in a jarring visual exclamation, exhuming the verses of an Emily Dickinson poem and laying them out in a contemporary and globalized context.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I died for beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nguyễn Trinh Thi","original_name":"Nguyễn Trinh Thi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/lVX9qOa3uaw4DFoOIDD5ztwiEZa.jpg","credit_id":"62f76a6ef925320092299d6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2208131","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
