It is a hard time for Markus and his girl Sandra from a lower grade, as he wants to hang out with his old friends, whereas she wants him to be there for her. It's an even harder time for Dirk, who is to be expelled from school if he fails the math exam that is coming up around midday, and it is the hardest time for Michael, who is a perfect pupil, but has no fun in life at all - and doesn't even know it yet. When Steven calls out a party to celebrate his letter of exemption from the army, they all get together for one of the last real cool events ever.","popularity":0.9359,"poster_path":"/qbGTIhLDCjnY6QvopLZ37DGvTdK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bavaria Filmverleih- und Produktions GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2000-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No More School","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":69,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Brühl","original_name":"Daniel Brühl","popularity":2.1854,"profile_path":"/3YlmTfiy5qZXkrdKGjaM1uMjGKP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Markus Baasweiler","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmin Schwiers","original_name":"Jasmin Schwiers","popularity":0.5209,"profile_path":"/yyleh2BTrMXZcFxjtajaBJMm00v.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels-Bruno Schmidt","original_name":"Niels-Bruno Schmidt","popularity":0.1925,"profile_path":"/rsb1NiWWDEdFqFgLbgq5CiAOwmB.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"'Stone' Steiner","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Tander","original_name":"Mina Tander","popularity":1.0159,"profile_path":"/tt4qCEs4cih62LpYtbpaLB7mX1e.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Melanie","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f11","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Egloff","original_name":"Tim Egloff","popularity":0.1001,"profile_path":"/lc8bCLFj3q7mcR28yoNHYlIZqqW.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Andre","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f15","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lavinia Wilson","original_name":"Lavinia Wilson","popularity":0.5842,"profile_path":"/io2rNsj3J90xhRO0KqEt0t5tuMe.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f19","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Näthe","original_name":"Christian Näthe","popularity":0.2954,"profile_path":"/69vsFzvGztyV87GJzCC5wGxqk9T.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Steven Baumgärtner","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f1d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Stein","original_name":"Axel Stein","popularity":0.5017,"profile_path":"/wMVOPqj1ZQcQyQeZS5PKM5tTP3d.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Dirk","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f21","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Kroehnert","original_name":"Sebastian Kroehnert","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/EBczQ25I58RLbLGZ2JoANPioNI.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Michael Karbrüggen","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f25","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Moschitto","original_name":"Denis Moschitto","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/xnnugJ5WNY1g57apo5DDctbxCSp.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Nabil","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f29","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Hildebrand","original_name":"Aaron Hildebrand","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/jZVXd4f7OHLTB6PXg0dsBNQMNaW.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Sascha","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f2d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Zimmermann","original_name":"Bettina Zimmermann","popularity":0.4246,"profile_path":"/9wcFYpl43P2HhwexoAF3XgATrBs.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Nadine","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f31","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Knüfken","original_name":"Markus Knüfken","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":"/1OI4tuTCIRbyDeVPK9MJrCSUiZi.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Polizist","credit_id":"52fe450bc3a36847f80b8f35","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hanemann","original_name":"Michael Hanemann","popularity":0.2433,"profile_path":"/l8YfICea0iskfIP8NfIQslyuIZB.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Hausm.
