Whichever is the case, neither friends nor foes are able to resist the powerful draw of Eisenstein's work. He was a person of complexity who was understood in very different ways, as a generous cosmopolitan and a stingy hermit, a cynic and yet a highly sensitive, vulnerable being. The film deals with a number of phases in Eisenstein's life, and tries to get away from the orthodox image of him by using new material to shed a different light on his biography.","popularity":0.079,"poster_path":"/hsigO3l2f0tquOGKiLCHvxjnw7b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2571,"logo_path":null,"name":"SelbstFilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1998-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Different Faces of Sergei Eisenstein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Eisenstein","original_name":"Сергей Эйзенштейн","popularity":0.3728,"profile_path":"/ks9uuDtKu9m9w50t18PamLZ91to.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6364200740d0fe007aceda31","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":56893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietmar Hochmuth","original_name":"Dietmar Hochmuth","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44d8c3a36847f80ad6ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":56894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oksana Bulgakova","original_name":"Oksana Bulgakova","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6100008c1684f7005f0bb9e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":56894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oksana Bulgakova","original_name":"Oksana Bulgakova","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6100009bcee4810075e132b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":56893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietmar Hochmuth","original_name":"Dietmar Hochmuth","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610000ab1684f7002e133905","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65468,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dieter Chill","original_name":"Dieter Chill","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610000b4cee481002dd54031","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116998,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dorothea Brühl","original_name":"Dorothea Brühl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610000c67ad08c0074869390","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0923976","wikidata_id":"Q124637790","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":912,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hbPqbsjNWpCimsl0OLIa4ezbMhs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1624}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1240,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hsigO3l2f0tquOGKiLCHvxjnw7b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":827},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1192,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mAKFIsyMMJ9p4QfluGCvgYdjdjR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":840},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1240,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qGBHKmU84HnFp61bTKSFB2Ljvzo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":827}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
