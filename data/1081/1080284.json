Renting a modest farmhouse in the small town of Mt. Prospect, Jim quickly discovers that there's more to this town, and his new home, than first meets the eye. Jim's bedroom overlooks Moloch Manor, a distant, decaying mansion that residents say is haunted. Local legend claims the spirit of Old Amon roams Moloch Manor's grounds as well as Mt. Prospect itself. Soon, strange and frightening events start to unfold around Jim and the trappings of his own beliefs begin to unravel.","popularity":0.0656,"poster_path":"/a4b45XM1YusWvnZMENgyuGZy3Rw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes you should be afraid of the dark","title":"With You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph P.
