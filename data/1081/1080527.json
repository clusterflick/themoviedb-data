The oldest film footage used in it are copies of a privately owned 16 mm B/W film and date from the 1930s, when the SS-Ahnenerbe, under the direction of SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Dr. Herbert Jankuhn of the CAU Kiel, carried out large-scale excavations on the site of the old settlement within the semicircular rampart from 1930 onwards and unearthed a wealth of significant finds. Further photographs come from the excavation of the 1960s under the direction of Dr. Kurt Schietzel (CAU Kiel).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking of Haithabu ... any questions?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3898228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Denzer","original_name":"Kurt Denzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7d6dcc15b5500f0b7f261","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
