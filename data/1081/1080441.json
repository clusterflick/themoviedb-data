He paved the way for many contemporary artists to have a more confident and theatrical act which indelibly shaped the next generation of pop and rock music. From working as a baggage handler at Heathrow airport to hiding his HIV diagnosis from the public until just before his death, Mercury's life was filled with adventure, publicity, and perhaps above all, a clear duality. He was both flamboyant and shy, outspoken and intensely private. The illness that claimed his life could never have defined Freddie, and now, years later, his legacy is greater than he could have ever imagined.","popularity":0.7068,"poster_path":"/gl7JIKuXHavyovwcOIF6boXnZAS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freddie","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gambaccini","original_name":"Paul Gambaccini","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/28KmXueehUDy8CdXB6q9zYugd2G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63d76d6312b10e007fdbc02a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kashmira Bulsara","original_name":"Kashmira Bulsara","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63d76d6920e6a500d5446461","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Watts","original_name":"Paul Watts","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63d76d75955c65008479f4a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Rock","original_name":"Mick Rock","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":"/pRWxBzfzqS5l0oYXPei5E6ivCKq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63d76d90955c65008479f4b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1407320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosie Horide","original_name":"Rosie Horide","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63d76d9ac15b55008e444d33","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Finlay Bald","original_name":"Finlay Bald","popularity":0.203,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d76d4222df2e00797721c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24977506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y6COoDsbrzBmLKmsgh6XtR54qqJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gl7JIKuXHavyovwcOIF6boXnZAS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e9reDdGGbaQrbhTZCYTZ0BeGD7w.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
