His music is composed intuitively and at the same time it is highly abstract. Without clear directionality and at the same time not without form. For a Japanese  audience it sounds “Western” and in the West it is regarded “Japanese”. A music in between categories. Like Kondo’s music the film is shifting between places and directions: a concert in the Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam, an elaborate sushi bar in Tokyo, a CD-production in a Cologne radio station, the Zuisenji temple in Kondo’s neighborhood in Kamakura.  Kondo wants his music to appear “normal”, without spectacular surface or narrative elements. A concept of “normality” you may also find in the films of Japanese filmmaker  Yasujiro Ozu, who – like Kondo – spent most of his life in Kamakura.","popularity":0.3597,"poster_path":"/ogY57mhmktZyFsLT0cz23ZMbhgE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viola Rusche & Hauke Harder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Shape of Time - the composer Jo Kondo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3898053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Kondo","original_name":"Jo Kondo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"63d7ab133dc313009df08de8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viola Rusche","original_name":"Viola Rusche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6b910955c65008c7a73ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hauke Harder","original_name":"Hauke Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6b91ff48b34008f47cd3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viola Rusche","original_name":"Viola Rusche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7ab663dc31300c7fa3b8d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496214,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hauke Harder","original_name":"Hauke Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7ab733dc31300c7fa3b93","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ludger Blanke","original_name":"Ludger Blanke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7ab5122df2e00843b170d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496216,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Zawadzki","original_name":"Martin Zawadzki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7ab3812b10e007b77da07","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ogY57mhmktZyFsLT0cz23ZMbhgE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":243710,"name":"contemporary classical music"},{"id":303652,"name":"japanese art"},{"id":312237,"name":"new york school"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
