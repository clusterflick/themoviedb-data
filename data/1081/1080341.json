The film tells the story of two sisters and six brothers who were born between 1933 and 1943 and grew up on a farm in a small village in Pomerania. With their intertwined, very different lives, the film tells not only the story of the eight siblings and their common escape with their parents after the end of World War 2, but also a piece of recent German history, when the siblings are separated by the inner-German border for over 40 years during the Cold War. Nevertheless, the contact between them never breaks.","popularity":0.1309,"poster_path":"/g8v81G1rYa9cusOVOILLkHm7sKy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eight Brothers and Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Weinert","original_name":"Christoph Weinert","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6ff65955c6500a8415a23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5BxgMnIOLWmb8GXEwvwXTAuQIkp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uisfl1WsxmerthG9P9G17HeHwJC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g8v81G1rYa9cusOVOILLkHm7sKy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Snowdance Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2023-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
