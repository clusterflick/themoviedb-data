Or \"1001 sonatas’ - each lasting about a minute but in total being  one of the longest pieces ever written?  Like a postmodern Erik Satie the Belgium composer Boudewijn Buckinx is using music history  as a playing field. The classical music audience is irritated, the avant-gardist wrinkles his  nose...  \"Daisies in a Meadow\" - that's how Buckinx described his \"1001 Sonatas” for violin and piano,  They play a leading role in our film, in the supporting roles the Spanish sun and the Belgian  rain. The latter, however, did not show up at the set - just as you always have to be prepared  for surprises with Boudewijn Buckinx.  \"Why is my music so simple? - Why is my music so complex?\" With a wink, Buckinx gives  various answers to these recurring questions.  The portrait of an immensely productive artist who is radically taking his own path.","popularity":0.2936,"poster_path":"/yJAzp9k9wV7kWMXNdOBQIlf1S2b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viola Rusche & Hauke Harder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To B or to B Flat - the composer Boudewijn Buckinx","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boudewijn Buckinx","original_name":"Boudewijn Buckinx","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63d7a0ca20e6a500bc016018","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hauke Harder","original_name":"Hauke Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6bac522df2e00b209322a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viola Rusche","original_name":"Viola Rusche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6babb955c6500a0eaf6f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73787,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johannes Imdahl","original_name":"Johannes Imdahl","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7a1d4c15b5500a052adef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viola Rusche","original_name":"Viola Rusche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7a1903dc313009df08a58","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496214,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hauke Harder","original_name":"Hauke Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7a1703dc31300c7fa37e0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yJAzp9k9wV7kWMXNdOBQIlf1S2b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":226093,"name":"postmodernism"},{"id":227302,"name":"portrait of an artist"},{"id":243710,"name":"contemporary classical music"},{"id":293118,"name":"experimental music"},{"id":312234,"name":"belgian art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
