Natalia Bessmertnova is soft and lyrical in the dual role of Odette and Odile; her eminently feminine quality makes her the ideal interpreter of this classic. The elegance and magnetism of Siegfried is masterfully portrayed by Alexander Bogatyrev. With exquisitely designed sets, and a dance corps whose skill rivals that of the principal ballerinas. This historic production was choreographed by the critically acclaimed master Yuri Grigorvich, with Tchaikovsky's timeless score performed by the Moscow Symphonic Orchestra under the baton of Algis Zhuraitis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2008-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Bolshoi Theatre and the Company of the Bolshoi Ballet 1984","title":"Swan Lake","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Swan Lake: The Bolshoi Theatre and the Company of the Bolshoi Ballet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1396867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Bessmertnova","original_name":"Наталья Бессмертнова","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/gfp6Nt5JSKwrUNVka5lK6ICwoy1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Odette/Odile","credit_id":"63d7d61620e6a5007ffe0312","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3898234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Bogatyrev","original_name":"Александр Богатырев","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Price Siegfried","credit_id":"63d7d63b3dc31300af228d1e","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0467497","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Released on DVD in the US in 2008 performed in 1984","release_date":"2008-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
