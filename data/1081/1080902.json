Sadao Chigusa was a lieutenant commander on the destroyer Akigumo. The top-secret mission was intended to destroy the U.S. Navy and crush America's fighting spirit. The destination of the task force was the empty sea, 230 miles to the north of Hawaii. This was within striking range of the American fleet. From here the Japanese would launch the biggest aerial attack in history. Pearl Harbor was no simple target. It was one of the most secure military bases in the world. No one thought it would be attacked from the sea. Nobody dreamt it would be attacked from the air. Wars are not won with luck or firepower. Much like a great game of chess, wars are won with strategy. Uncover the strategy that guaranteed victory, or defeat, in some of these most decisive battles of modern history.","popularity":0.0873,"poster_path":"/4wg7NOfQOIUM1cT9dFXvNcLkPtM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War Strategy Revealed: Pearl Harbour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3156248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Jagow","original_name":"Lee Jagow","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63d8f55e955c6500ce0d7ad0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3899528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Summer","original_name":"Hannah Summer","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d8f587c15b5500a0535fcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3899528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Summer","original_name":"Hannah Summer","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d8f59ac15b550079fc6142","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5tjdkZSakaAikxMv3fjl5iT5Mvd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4wg7NOfQOIUM1cT9dFXvNcLkPtM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
