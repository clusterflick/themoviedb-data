At the time, almost no one predicted that this pandemic would drag on and on, make us sit at 'home', reintroduce curfew or even let us partly forget how it is to hug our loved ones.  During this a year, we have more or less adapted to the ‘pandemic lifestyle’. Some have been significantly affected while others have remained almost unchanged. Exactly a year later we look at ourselves - how does this adaptation look? Or - have we adapted at all?  This story is told by 624 submitted videos all filmed in a single day - on March 11, 2021.  Filmed in Georgia, Finland, France, Switzerland, USA, Russia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Canada, Brazil, Belgium, Iceland, Spain, Vietnam and Malta.","popularity":0.1225,"poster_path":"/p3yhRijc2zcuu4s00z2nL26HA9D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tritone Studios","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2021-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day After The Year","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Armands Začs","original_name":"Armands Začs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6xvyKUtUt7y9SGofrTxkvE3CnVH.jpg","credit_id":"61cf4e11a27502001cb23b79","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Armands Začs","original_name":"Armands Začs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6xvyKUtUt7y9SGofrTxkvE3CnVH.jpg","credit_id":"61cf4e06028420001c62fcaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2891242,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ingus Baušķenieks","original_name":"Ingus Baušķenieks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cf4e420cd32a008e1f1f0f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Ābele","original_name":"Raitis Ābele","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cf4ded0cd32a00665d5161","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866213,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jānis Zaneribs","original_name":"Jānis Zaneribs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cf4e2a028420001c62fcee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Ābele","original_name":"Raitis Ābele","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cf4dce22f5d70069e886fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906940,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Zanda Zeidaka","original_name":"Zanda Zeidaka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cf4e5ff9a3fb001a7110e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16754016","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3yhRijc2zcuu4s00z2nL26HA9D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Worldwide","release_date":"2021-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
