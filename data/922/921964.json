Just a month after narrowly surviving being hit by a car, high-altitude mountaineer and research-zoologist Boyan Petrov starts his recovery and long preparation to continue his dream: climbing all the fourteen 8,000-meter peaks. Without supplementary oxygen and 3 times cancer survivor, he has climbed all 10 of the 14 eight-thousanders. Now it's time for the world's giant - Everest. For this purpose, Boyan starts his journey by \"warming-up\" with the lowest peak among them - the so-called \"dwarf\" Shishapangma. Number 11 on his bucket list. An unexpected twist of fate leads to his disappearance a few meters under the peak which activates an unprecedented interstate rescue mission and helicopter searches between the countries of Nepal, China, and Bulgaria.","popularity":0.0756,"poster_path":"/sod6HDkpmeMQDvlo8nKailfyjn7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2021-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here I Am, Again","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boyan Petrov","original_name":"Boyan Petrov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"HImself","credit_id":"61d01d4c1b722c0019fbc913","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Polly Guentcheva","original_name":"Polly Guentcheva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01d711684f7008dc71dc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Polly Guentcheva","original_name":"Polly Guentcheva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01d98a27502001cb3fad1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348494,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Altaparmakova","original_name":"Nina Altaparmakova","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01dab7b7b4d0069c296c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449973,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Krasimir Andonov","original_name":"Krasimir Andonov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01ddd1684f7001ca2a50c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348494,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Altaparmakova","original_name":"Nina Altaparmakova","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01df4c15f890040eea748","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1191657,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martichka Bozhilova","original_name":"Martichka Bozhilova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01e1b1684f7001ca2a55f","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Polly Guentcheva","original_name":"Polly Guentcheva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01e37028420006419cf88","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emil Spahiyski","original_name":"Emil Spahiyski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d01e49d8f44e004201eb98","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14506630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nbOqIRkxLV8AOOQsm4mA8hx25Wh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l2GxWDgEajYebbHGdal6CAcQOQR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.495,"height":1288,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/di7FQHTFsUzmocRLyhjtTluYmux.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1926}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sod6HDkpmeMQDvlo8nKailfyjn7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1984,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rmuTBQDOI1MLiniOhFes4wHA302.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bg","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
