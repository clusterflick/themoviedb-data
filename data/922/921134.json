In Borneo, one of their last island outposts, lives one today who is a legend. He's won more than just a kingdom, he's won human hearts. They gave him the name Kusasi. The Orangutan King is the story of Kusasi's life told to us by a remarkable witness. Dr Birute M. Galdikas has been researching orangutans in Borneo for over 40 years. Now, for the first time, Dr Galdikas will draw audiences deep into the orangutan universe. With enthusiasm and insight she tells us this special story - taking us back 30 years and unfolding Kusasi's story with detail, energy, and the wonder that she still feels for the orangutan species. As a three year old orphan, Kusasi fell under the care of Galdikas in her forest research camp. But driven by a cunning and tenacious spirit Kusasi did not behave as the other ex-captive infants.","popularity":0.8238,"poster_path":"/evLpwtEdxXEi5hCsfDgBEYJo7Dg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Orangutan King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McGann","original_name":"Paul McGann","popularity":0.7532,"profile_path":"/4NAtQI30CAaJuQRiot9twe7J9t9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61cc5fc185702e0060bc9b46","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1012023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birute Galdikas","original_name":"Birute Galdikas","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61cc5feee25860009885bb2d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harvey Jones","original_name":"Harvey Jones","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc600f9b6e4700199a10ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harvey Jones","original_name":"Harvey Jones","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc601aa097dc001c3be8e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033423","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/evLpwtEdxXEi5hCsfDgBEYJo7Dg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7265,"name":"borneo"},{"id":14762,"name":"orangutan"},{"id":239761,"name":"orang-utan"},{"id":247524,"name":"organ smuggling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
