Odd, unconventional and unusual - these are animals that don't normally grab the limelight. From the parrot that has forgotten how to fly, to the bear that has turned vegetarian, a chameleon that is barely bigger than an ant, and a penguin that lives in a forest. Nature's Misfits reveals the extraordinary and rarely seen lives of these evolutionary oddballs, their strange habitats, unusual forms, and the incredible hurdles they overcome.","popularity":0.5316,"poster_path":"/wIyH7dE8jnKKAjj2g3pngt7HGRm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature's Misfits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Bailey","original_name":"Bill Bailey","popularity":0.7468,"profile_path":"/nEFCqUk4DtNRMmwJ04HJTcmCEt4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61cc377138520200a200d8c0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gavin Boyland","original_name":"Gavin Boyland","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/zmiT0XtTaR21DbOQ9NPmp0TiPCy.jpg","credit_id":"61cc378c92e55b005c4fb803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8656798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wIyH7dE8jnKKAjj2g3pngt7HGRm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
