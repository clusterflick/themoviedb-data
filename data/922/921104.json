She lives with her family in a caravan site on the outskirts of a small Bavarian town. Everybody still speaks Romani and continues to live by the customs handed down. That means that the children take part in adult life and that the very highly respected parents describe how it used to be. In this community, all age groups live together naturally. For these Sinti, `gypsy' is an insult. At school they are taught there are two cultures, two languages and two realities: that of the Sinti and that of the Germans. While German is spoken at school, the only pupils are Sinti children. Brigitta animatedly describes the material deprivations, which are mollified by the life as `one big family'. Brigitta knows all too well where she belongs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uaFLUyziP9MLuaTCOtwcfQuPJ02.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Katrin Seybold Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":25006,"logo_path":"/ziWQdswTHwQ9V40O4kvhc2DYYBK.png","name":"Institut f√ºr Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wir sind Sintikinder und keine Zigeuner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrin Seybold","original_name":"Katrin Seybold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc401e38520200419aff65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Melanie Spitta","original_name":"Melanie Spitta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc3f5d92e55b008b76b80f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrin Seybold","original_name":"Katrin Seybold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc3f2ce25860001dba515c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":48987,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bettina Lewertoff","original_name":"Bettina Lewertoff","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc400503bf84001cebadc2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1136,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uaFLUyziP9MLuaTCOtwcfQuPJ02.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
