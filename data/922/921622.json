Their lives uncertain and at the risk of being denounced by their neighbours or relatives, they transmitted confidential information, disseminated anti-Nazi leaflets, and saved Jews from deportation. When arrested, they were imprisoned, deported, or even executed; after 1945 - despite their acts of bravery - these women were forgotten - now some of these heroines are emerging from the shadows. Among them are propaganda ministry official Libertas Schulze-Boysen, journalist Ruth Andreas-Friedrich, and student Sophie Scholl.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nnmMWo0jYkhN24JoetTMjwjfBHn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Women Who Fought Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3uDsGiN6Zo6w2yiQFMtsm0J5snS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nnmMWo0jYkhN24JoetTMjwjfBHn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
