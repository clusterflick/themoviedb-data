Objects emerge and merge in the gloom; the old woman dissolves and reforms. Her muteness, her glaucomas and her inactivity render things indeterminate. By naming objects, animal and phenomena we reduce and delineate them, and so separate ourselves from the world around us.  Shot at ISO 409,000 the image is granulated by pixelation and noise and any discreteness an object or thing might possess is confused by the digital processes of the camera.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xOh4QAWL7NkSl0QMPAIr1kPm6Op.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A bed-bound woman's year passes as a day.","title":"The Names of Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3363332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Treherne","original_name":"Patrick Treherne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61cd732653f83300601c2d97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3363333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isobel Treherne","original_name":"Isobel Treherne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61cd732f8566d2006140b175","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2448962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Treherne","original_name":"Peter Treherne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/n3r9j71uibTWsFSbCDMhrunIJK1.jpg","credit_id":"61cd735ba843c10087a86e4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2LkjyjjrS0szyiJojb11nA2Zn7q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xOh4QAWL7NkSl0QMPAIr1kPm6Op.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
