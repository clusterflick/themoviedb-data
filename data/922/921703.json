But their success in reducing crime, and making their \"campus\" a magnet for art enthusiasts, families, and local residents, also attracts deep-pocket real estate developers.  Their bold response is to include community planning and new housing as a part of their art practice. If they can shape an area in Third Ward for the residents, there's a chance they can keep the neighborhood intact.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Third Ward TX","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Garrison","original_name":"Andrew Garrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cec598798e06001d73f58b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364574,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nancy Bless","original_name":"Nancy Bless","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cec63f6dc507001cdc9b50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209964,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noland Walker","original_name":"Noland Walker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cec69118864b009204de5a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638678,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandra Guardado","original_name":"Sandra Guardado","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cec712a802360068d17b0b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Garrison","original_name":"Andrew Garrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cec730396e9700936a3754","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":48502,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ed Radtke","original_name":"Ed Radtke","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cec78e798e06006a28e55b","department":"Editing","job":"Consulting Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Garrison","original_name":"Andrew Garrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6680952e90e0bddb81d577de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
