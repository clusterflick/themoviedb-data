Richard Taylor charts Pugin's extraordinary life story and discovers how his work continues to influence Britain today.","popularity":0.4734,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pugin: God's Own Architect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2687656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Taylor","original_name":"Richard Taylor","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ll8VvK4h8HBGevwJ8dbMTucjxWh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"61cc14e3a097dc004281ca49","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Johnson","original_name":"David Johnson","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc144c3dc313006611e535","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Johnson","original_name":"David Johnson","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc14688566d20098b1bed0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363139,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"William Lyons","original_name":"William Lyons","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b25d3841ea6104626db900","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qPwcjBE9kT4Yp43lvuchkly6FZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2301,"name":"architect"},{"id":14905,"name":"britain"},{"id":33505,"name":"gothic"},{"id":173317,"name":"old building"},{"id":252596,"name":"victorian era"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
