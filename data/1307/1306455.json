One day, she wanders into a strange town where the sun never sets, and happens to run into Mucchan there. Fumi’s father still meddles excessively in her life, and her brother gradually becomes invisible. Fumi’s vision juxtaposes her suffocating everyday life and summer days spent with her brother filled with laughter. Director Hina Murata’s first feature film, The Midnight Sun freely switches between screen sizes to delicately portray Fumi’s world. The effective use of embroidery as a prop, together with refreshing performances from Sakiko Honda as Fumi and Saki Toyoyama as Mucchan, bring a sense of reality to this wondrous world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/uWS3RYMvlWglWNVa7A50SgP33Tm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Midnight Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4846829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakiko Honda","original_name":"Sakiko Honda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66a0ae3749bc9e7daa18b3bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4846830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saki Toyoyama","original_name":"Saki Toyoyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66a0ae458ad439449a6e9f0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4846831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshihiko Terada","original_name":"Toshihiko Terada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66a0ae56fc113f04da2630a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4846833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hinata Oshiro","original_name":"Hinata Oshiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66a0ae60c81e9f0da76ea599","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3579244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hina Murata","original_name":"Hina Murata","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jBs3QWSBWhhCZyQ3UswUPm7I0Ej.jpg","credit_id":"66a0ec21fbc59ee5f402168c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"orinifurete_"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uWS3RYMvlWglWNVa7A50SgP33Tm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1451}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Skip City International D-Cinema Festival","release_date":"2024-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
