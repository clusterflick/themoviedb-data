Via a succession of brief encounters in the stark interiors of his rented room and local dive, Rudy, a loose collection of signifiers in search of a sign, is forced to confront his own physical and emotional detachment from the world. From this minimal framework, \"Villa Mink\" is at once a study of time and space, penetrating examination of distorted male identity, and visual exploration of the enduring legacies of the mythical Western frontier.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2pWD7wAt4gql6sAPuWvyWeJfxsH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Villa Mink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darron Carswell","original_name":"Darron Carswell","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6673807cb705d30a7b6ebeae","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Wells, Jr.","original_name":"Douglas Wells, Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667380ad3db8aef3588f0ddd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darron Carswell","original_name":"Darron Carswell","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66738071b1b669feab8f0d80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darron Carswell","original_name":"Darron Carswell","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66738088900e56b9aaceecdd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784715,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rita Lee","original_name":"Rita Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667380e987fbc36f5e55b718","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784714,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daryl Eugene","original_name":"Daryl Eugene","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667380c5e395f62139ec619d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Wells, Jr.","original_name":"Douglas Wells, Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667380a2ee0a7177c86465a0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pWD7wAt4gql6sAPuWvyWeJfxsH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
