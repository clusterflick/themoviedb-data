Mountaineers, adventurers and scientists set out in Cheynes 2, a former whaling vessel, on a voyage from Hobart to Heard Island, south-west of Perth, near Antarctica. Bad weather forced them to dock at Albany and they made another stop at the French island of Kerguelen for fuel and water. By the time Captain Laurie McEwan sailed the final two days to Heard Island, a six-week voyage had taken 12 weeks. The ship was declared a wreck and the extended time at sea had left them with just two days worth of fuel.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nByhMREDxHNRXuuEkvA2O0PYbw2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ship That Shouldn’t Have","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ray Sinclair","original_name":"Ray Sinclair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6673a009e53a15a64016be03","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ray Sinclair","original_name":"Ray Sinclair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66739eb5169091fb92a3bec9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ray Sinclair","original_name":"Ray Sinclair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66739ee3169091fb92a3bedc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geoff Gardiner","original_name":"Geoff Gardiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66739f390a59ae1602a3c26e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Matamis","original_name":"James Matamis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66739f77900e56b9aacef5da","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784833,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dave Cooper","original_name":"Dave Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66739f93476b0bc3eb16be0f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784834,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andy Matamis","original_name":"Andy Matamis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66739fa8fed1d650ed0248d1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Les Bessenyel","original_name":"Les Bessenyel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66739fbc8248617a704eaf68","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784841,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Werner Hölzl","original_name":"Werner Hölzl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6673a1e33b91abaf60cef775","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784842,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ron Hurrell","original_name":"Ron Hurrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6673a1fa231877b59e6ec4d4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784843,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Davidson","original_name":"Robert Davidson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6673a222c15c03811793d1fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1342,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nByhMREDxHNRXuuEkvA2O0PYbw2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":906}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
