This geographical project focuses on the main migratory axes: Oujda, entry point for migrants in Morocco; Tangier, from where migrants can try to cross the strait or the fences of Ceuta; Rabat, organization space; and Laayoune, the closest point to the Canaries. The video questions the nature and meaning of these extraterritorial enclaves that structure the Moroccan territory.","popularity":1.4646,"poster_path":"/aXvfskeFDgJBsncXyQ1XLQ6diPt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossroads
