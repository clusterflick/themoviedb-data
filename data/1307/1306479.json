There was just so much footage I had a hard time committing to making the video.  In this ride, we are attempting to combine the Big Lonely route with the Ochoco Overlander though I made a mistake and downloaded an old version of the Big Lonely which resulted in some detours.  Weather also impacted our plans, we got a late start, and we ended up cutting the trip a day short.  We ended up meeting a ton of bike packers on this route!  More than we ever have on any other route!  It was cool to see so many people out on their bikes.  There were pretty typical mishaps and antics on this trip.  I still canâ€™t believe how many videos Rob breaks a can of wine in one of his bags.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Lonely Ochoco Overlander Bikepacking Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
