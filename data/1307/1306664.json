Interspersing immigration facts with interviews with first and second generation Haitian, Belizean, Guyanese and Trinidadian Americans, it discusses contributions that Caribbean Americans make to U.S. society. Second generation children often come into conflict with their parents as they become Americanized and break away from their parentsâ€™ traditions, while parents may become disillusioned with the American Dream and experience discrimination in their host communities. Included is a discussion of Caribbean and African-American relations.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture Clash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
