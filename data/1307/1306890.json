In 2014, he took over the Pavillon Ledoyen, just steps from the Champs-Élysées. In just six years, the chef created three restaurants there, making the Pavillon Ledoyen the most starred establishment in the world. From 2019 to 2023, the film followed the daily life of this temple of haute cuisine, narrating how the chef and his team of 150 employees navigated these challenging years. An improbable and wild drama unfolds, culminating in the unimaginable for Yannick Alléno: the death of his son Antoine, killed by a reckless driver in the streets of Paris. Beyond the behind-the-scenes of great cuisine, the quest for stars, the pursuit of excellence, sharing, and transmission, the film questions the fragility of fate and the search for meaning.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/h8B8tlQ1xzKoo8OobWf14vocjjw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film about Yannick Alléno and his 150 collaborators","title":"La Traversée","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/h8B8tlQ1xzKoo8OobWf14vocjjw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":643}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
