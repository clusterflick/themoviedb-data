At her high school homecoming dance, she grapples with uncertainty, fear of rejection, and impossible longing as she hovers in the periphery of the girl of her dreams. This is a story of that extraordinary moment of courage, where desire and disaster stand so close, and the whole world hangs by a breath. This film was created as part of the San Francisco Dance Film Festival's Co-Laboratory, an experimental dance film laboratory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coming Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Dymek","original_name":"Marta Dymek","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6673528688db04b80e93be34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
