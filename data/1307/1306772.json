Soon, Luiza meets V, Celia's new caretaker. According to V, Celia is under the illusion that V is her daughter. Celia loves tending to her \"newborn\" and the home they share - something that irks Luiza, who has never seen this nurturing side of her mother before. A strange, sweaty descent into a fever dream ensues, paralleling the reproduction cycle of the parasitic, Glyptapanteles wasp. Before long, Luiza learns precisely what is under her mother's skin and must escape before it makes its way under hers, too - but some cycles pierce too deep to be broken.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/hvQOQHF0EhTbt9MBDXIiWuZAe65.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vespa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Carrer","original_name":"Alexandra Carrer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66736805fd6b18817537586e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Carvalho","original_name":"Ashley Carvalho","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"667368247ef78b7d0b90e9d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Ford","original_name":"Victoria Ford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6673684312bd1d117c4e90fd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Travis Orozco","original_name":"Travis Orozco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667367f0231877b59e6eaebe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olívia Ramos","original_name":"Olívia Ramos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667367d45d411d30966eaeb7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4784528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olívia Ramos","original_name":"Olívia Ramos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667367c7d5ac5829fc748087","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28455727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hvQOQHF0EhTbt9MBDXIiWuZAe65.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
