If true, the Greek islands have become much more than a sun-drenched paradise for those living the holiday dream. There are dark rumours of EU-funded boats carrying masked men, people being rounded up on land, forced onto coast guard boats and then abandoned in flimsy rubber dinghies at sea. There are multiple cases of people subsequently losing their lives. Are these masked men responsible?  Against this troubling background, in June 2023, an overloaded trawler flips in front of a Greek coast guard patrol boat. More than 600 men, women and children die in the water. A billionaire’s super yacht takes survivors to shore. The accounts of these survivors suggest that coast guard is at fault – something the Greek authorities deny.","popularity":0.0569,"poster_path":"/xOOHE3aUBUg6YHAQIVPDTLvUAMp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Calm: Killing in the Med?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Steele","original_name":"Ben Steele","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66718294c7c8eaeb8d3f1061","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4781769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Radford","original_name":"Mike Radford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667182b1e402eda648f2fc94","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4781768,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucile Smith","original_name":"Lucile Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667182a348cb2578f7f2fbf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2GCxu20ilmDzOF7aRpYDPJIMd3Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":841,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2OeJBuVfmk1RVTceM1ZL6iexLV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":587},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xOOHE3aUBUg6YHAQIVPDTLvUAMp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"R18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
