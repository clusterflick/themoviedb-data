Over the course of 25 painstaking and perilous years, Eqvtime managed to bring back all the treasures without any losses. Upon his return, the 82-year-old Eqvtime faced questioning by KGB General Nikoloz Rukhadze. He was subsequently expelled from the University of Georgia, sentenced to house arrest, and prohibited from receiving visits from friends and family; many of whom were also arrested.","popularity":0.2874,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Candle in the Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imedo Kakhiani","original_name":"იმედა კახიანი","popularity":0.1706,"profile_path":"/9TaK4C6vvkQi6MgotUmtob04c7N.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eqvtime Takaishvili","credit_id":"6671ddfd2207f56eac83da25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4782309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleko Makharoblishvili","original_name":"Aleko Makharoblishvili","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gen.
