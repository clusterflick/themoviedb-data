Bob Dylan and Muddy Waters admired him, the Rolling Stones tried to hire him - and his fans worshipped him. Clad in faded denim and a checked shirt, he sold 30 million records and became a charismatic icon of Irish music, but away from the stage, Rory was an intensely private man. His closest confidante was his brother Dónal, who accompanied Rory on his rise from their childhood Everly Brothers stage performances and the showband scene across the north and south of the Irish border, through to the deafening heart of the ‘70s rock scene in London - and far beyond. From playing bomb-shattered Belfast at the height of the Troubles to touring across America with everyone from Blind Faith to KISS, Dónal was at Rory's side to witness his greatest triumphs and, after all too brief a span of years, his decline into illness and a tragically early death.","popularity":0.3585,"poster_path":"/dfBBiQ2tNLRz6T7RECjPBvdRxrY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20639,"logo_path":"/qypOd6AlNrfHIXN9nArZmyMv6do.png","name":"BBC Northern Ireland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":175758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dearg Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XI","name":"Northern Ireland"}],"release_date":"2024-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A look at the life and career of the original Irish guitar hero, Rory Gallagher","title":"The Rory Gallagher Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rory Gallagher","original_name":"Rory Gallagher","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/sM7PEZvSuHiBcG64XoNqnC4sa6M.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66716d23df2da72b1183d110","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115182,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Donal Gallagher","original_name":"Donal Gallagher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66716d32232915b9a93f1193","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":419327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Marr","original_name":"Johnny Marr","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/vJESfF4XvN99aBXHgoxj1gTrEAj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"678bebf82e41634e5264f0fc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian May","original_name":"Brian May","popularity":0.3142,"profile_path":"/rTqWm7dZLbrprpKMtOAOeCcj24e.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"678bec1f2e41634e5264f105","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Geldof","original_name":"Bob Geldof","popularity":0.4837,"profile_path":"/9fDWH8hQifcpzWHcTjBQLngsvJT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"678bec2e5add61273d64fae0","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dfBBiQ2tNLRz6T7RECjPBvdRxrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
