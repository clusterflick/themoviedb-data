Gang members had barricaded themselves in the area and fired at the police officers who arrived. When Himuro learns that the scene is Tokorozawa, he wonders if it is Shima from the Sugimasa group. According to Sahara (Takayuki Kaneba) of the special investigation team, the incident was triggered by a tip-off that Gota, a member of the Sugimasa-gumi, was the head of Shabu, but Miyazono, the head of the Sugimasa-gumi, would have done something like that. Himuro couldn't accept that there was no such thing.","popularity":0.8337,"poster_path":"/jSKPCo8Tit0TCKvRDOKp79sK5t4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unification of Japan 59","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasukaze Motomiya","original_name":"本宮泰風","popularity":0.7318,"profile_path":"/psL6KI2IktDBICsrEw4zKDKdnOe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6673c6ed88db04b80e93de20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口祥行","popularity":0.4173,"profile_path":"/jAaHxP854jQzsqRhx6vCQ05hwHc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6673c6f5a7e066bddb25c9b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小沢仁志","popularity":0.8392,"profile_path":"/m2mLrkCcttT2fgHBMfObbq6G0sw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6673c6fa3b91abaf60cefac1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shun Sugata","original_name":"菅田俊","popularity":0.9622,"profile_path":"/e7z8T7P99Ylogads2YfzxbF9avU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6673c70d1eb93bc9534eb5b8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideo Nakano","original_name":"中野英雄","popularity":0.5051,"profile_path":"/7MK9M0WlC5w184FAPMMzNdkH5MH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6673c71b66eecfc0a0024cc4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3747270,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keiichiro Murata","original_name":"Keiichiro Murata","popularity":0.1578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6673c7368248617a704eb3af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Tsuji","original_name":"辻裕之","popularity":0.4307,"profile_path":"/pzwnKRn7NZdF5VhxtOZkmp245sI.jpg","credit_id":"6673c72c8c602d737c4eb7dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2161,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/jSKPCo8Tit0TCKvRDOKp79sK5t4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1528},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cc3SVWSLYZZ7VnDx4IpyVyOtW0i.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
