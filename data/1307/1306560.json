In the 18th century Joseon Dynasty, Shin Don Bok put together the anecdote collection Hak San Han Eon, which includes a story of two people willingly venturing deep into a cave rather than seeking light outside, eventually reaching a completely different world. In this film, the two people become women, and together, they load the film into the camera. In the utter darkness where only the sound of water is heard, images emerge. In that place where everything is inverse, the camera becomes a watering can, a mirror, and a teapot.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/do5o87wD2WdsCE5IPwivaASydjI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Cave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2696650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heehyun Choi","original_name":"Heehyun Choi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/DUIbjxM8yfjZhig7KRgzm1Wphn.jpg","credit_id":"6672cd126283a6acca169e19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k1IM3mq2aEalD8GsyvmunaGL49k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/do5o87wD2WdsCE5IPwivaASydjI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Edinburgh International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Our Cave (우리의 동굴) excerpt","key":"923042420","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-13T18:34:13.000Z","id":"66c261a546dc927c7dd0c6ab"}]}}}
