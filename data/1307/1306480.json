The film follows 10 cyclists as they disappear into the landscape surrounding the Dark Divide 300, a 330 mile Pacific Northwest bikepacking route through Nisqually, Cowlitz, and Squaxin Island land in Washington state. Tribal leaders from the area provide context on what the land means to them presently, has meant to their Tribes historically, and what the adventure cycling community can do to become better stewards to the land we occupy. The route will be run as an endurance bikepacking race in summer 2023.","popularity":0.1617,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dark Divide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
