Полная крови биография","overview":"\"Conquered Chechnya is the cornerstone of Putin's power. It all started there. If we admit that the leader of conquered Chechnya is a scoundrel, what will remain of Putin himself?\" This is how one Russian official responded when asked about the untouchability of Ramzan Kadyrov, who has created a true sultanate within Russia, operating beyond the reach of Russian law. This documentary is a historical investigation into the blood-soaked path Kadyrov has taken to build his sultanate. It uncovers new evidence of murders surrounding Kadyrov, large-scale corruption of unimaginable proportions, and equally shocking details of his personal life, including a harem with underage concubines and brutal punishments.","popularity":0.2238,"poster_path":"/xUOXSnrCaNOiU8mcCvTwpzWMpvo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Chechen","iso_639_1":"ce","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kadyrov's Vertical.
