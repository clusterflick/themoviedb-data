Nate, an unemployed teenager, is too caught up in his own world to notice or even care. For Nate, a terrible tragedy is when he can't find the time to hang out with his best friend Steve. Steve is a wise cracking, quick thinking, loyal friend- at least that's how Nate sees it. The reality is that Steve is a Zombie; a living corpse, contaminated by an infection that raises the dead, giving them an unquenchable desire to feed on human flesh. Despite his gruesome appearance and lack of social skills, the people of Pine Falls consider Steve to be nothing more than Nate's handsome friend, until it's too late.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nSuIcsO7HnaZOLqOYB14cGN4Ycm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Awesome Fighter
