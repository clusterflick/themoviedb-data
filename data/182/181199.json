A few ominous omens try to avert him from his decision, like a bloodstain on the floor or his tongue turning black, but Damien pays little attention. He arranges a sojourn at one of Father Pierre’s centers. When he arrives, he’s greeted by the three employees of the center, a trinity as silent as disturbing who slurp from their soup as voraciously as Hannibal Lecter from a dish of lamb brains. Just like Alice In Wonderland, our reporter finds himself in a surreal universe. Every door he opens, will confront him with his own demons : his cowardice, his incapacity to decide anything and his continuous flight from responsibility.","popularity":0.1154,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abracadabra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163948,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Damien Desamory","original_name":"Damien Desamory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonia Baehr","original_name":"Antonia Baehr","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucile Desamory","original_name":"Lucile Desamory","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b21","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederique Franke","original_name":"Frederique Franke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy McKenzie","original_name":"Lucy McKenzie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b29","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aline Moroccutti","original_name":"Aline Moroccutti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b2d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucile Desamory","original_name":"Lucile Desamory","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucile Desamory","original_name":"Lucile Desamory","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163955,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Artur Castro Freire","original_name":"Artur Castro Freire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b3f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163948,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Damien Desamory","original_name":"Damien Desamory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c619251416c75118b45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2776668","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"ENA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
