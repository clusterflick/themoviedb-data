Eighteen years ago Terry had a life-changing experience in the jungles of Borneo, where he encountered orangutans in the wild for the first time. Now he is going back to find out what the future holds for these endangered species, and discover a new threat to their habitat that could push them to the brink of extinction. His Alzheimer's will make the trip an incredible challenge both physically and mentally, as he contemplates the role of mankind in the eradication of the planet's species, and considers his own inevitable extinction.","popularity":1.8813,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48439,"logo_path":"/xRTA0PpuVnbiISBefJ5BKCzmslc.png","name":"KEO Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terry Pratchett: Facing Extinction","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95903,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terry Pratchett","original_name":"Terry Pratchett","popularity":0.443,"profile_path":"/6UCgOIW1Cnm7IHMpeSJyhkjVLeQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4c719251416c7511aa97","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Stephenson","original_name":"Mike Stephenson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623f44d5223a8b004ad79424","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Russell","original_name":"Charlie Russell","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5501e3d49251413da1002e7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Craig Hunter","original_name":"Craig Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5501e3e6c3a3685b9e002f59","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2812232","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14762,"name":"orangutan"},{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":156803,"name":"extinction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
