He, his girlfriend Sarah, and her deaf son Dennis, head overseas to decide whether to live in the property or to sell it. But when they arrive, they find the locals offer a chilly reception whenever Annie's name is mentioned. It turns out that Annie had lost her son some 50 years ago in a tragedy at the nearby orphanage where she had placed him temporarily, due to circumstances beyond her control. But she had continued to see her son even after his death. Now, young Dennis is drawn to the derelict orphanage, and to a new friend who only he can see. And Peter must solve a decades-old mystery of how the orphans died before his family faces a similar fate.","popularity":2.6963,"poster_path":"/iruhh91fI0Wib8sV8uKJX4kCYqA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cobra Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A danger only he can see.
