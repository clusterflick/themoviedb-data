But it was also a triumph for espionage, deceit, and thinking of the most twisted sort.\r Following on from his hugely successful BBC Two documentaries, Operation Mincemeat and Double Agent: The Eddie Chapman Story (Agent Zigzag), writer and presenter Ben Macintyre returns to the small screen to bring to life his third best-selling book - Double Cross The True Story of the D-Day Spies.\r Macintyre reveals the gripping true story of five of the double agents who helped to make D-day such a success.","popularity":0.218,"poster_path":"/uSYzGiotFPWbFSAy1yiqJzss9F5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-day Spies","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1779291,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Macintyre","original_name":"Ben Macintyre","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":"/zhXfRoeFDS79Sn2Zg1vOAsacAok.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"58cdb5dbc3a368508c011681","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuppence Middleton","original_name":"Tuppence Middleton","popularity":1.7812,"profile_path":"/otWL8adXFVViJG1Y8rsGlPn3R2H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Treasure's Voice","credit_id":"658597ae3acd2054337b7538","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1590860,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Cheney","original_name":"Matt Cheney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6585999f223e2041ca9505b5","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162014,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anton Short","original_name":"Anton Short","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6585995e223e20422894ecf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":195619,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally George","original_name":"Sally George","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6585989528d7fe5a1139c3f7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303050,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Wolf","original_name":"Mark Wolf","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65859903223e20422894ecd9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Whiteman","original_name":"Matthew Whiteman","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58cdb5a2c3a368510e011356","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1779291,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Macintyre","original_name":"Ben Macintyre","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":"/zhXfRoeFDS79Sn2Zg1vOAsacAok.jpg","credit_id":"5a14d59692514178bc00324a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2313238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2TdllLQp2rRuv0m8z3DdrV9mxaQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.648,"height":2403,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uSYzGiotFPWbFSAy1yiqJzss9F5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1558}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
