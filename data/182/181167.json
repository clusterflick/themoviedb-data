The film jumps from one strange scenario to the next, including a woman who goes publicly nude on a bet, a family man wearing an anti-radiation suit in fear of the end of the world, a orgy-indulging cult with a kissing fetish, a role-reversal wedding of performing transvestites, a middle-aged man who gives striptease lessons to housewives, a self-absorbed loner who believes he’s a vampire, a ritualistic funeral procession involving the burning of a mannequin, a mass swimming pool baptism, etc.  Probably the most fascinatingly grotesque bit, which at the same time is strangely touching, is when a woman has her beloved deceased medium sized dog stuffed by a pipe-smoking taxidermist (shown in graphic detail) and installed with an electronic barking device!","popularity":0.2344,"poster_path":"/5CSYAyZ7VDLqpHkZrWi0rBMy7Rz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Jauniaux","origin_country":""},{"id":14411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinévision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1970-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden Paris","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben-Ghou-Bey","original_name":"Ben-Ghou-Bey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c609251416c75118933","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Fenn","original_name":"Gene Fenn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c609251416c75118937","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1451130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maelle Pertuzo","original_name":"Maelle Pertuzo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"La modèle du photographe (uncredited)","credit_id":"662579c0cb5c8e01643f97e3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1064100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Louis van Belle","original_name":"Jean-Louis van Belle","popularity":0.749,"profile_path":"/l7oqEforLC7vYYLg91wgsubnLB9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c609251416c75118929","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1064100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Louis van Belle","original_name":"Jean-Louis van Belle","popularity":0.749,"profile_path":"/l7oqEforLC7vYYLg91wgsubnLB9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c609251416c7511892f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0258005","wikidata_id":"Q30740950","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5CSYAyZ7VDLqpHkZrWi0rBMy7Rz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":108,"name":"transvestism"},{"id":9719,"name":"taxidermy"},{"id":196543,"name":"mondo"},{"id":210939,"name":"fakir"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
