Witness Babe Ruth at bat; Lou Gehrig's \"\"luckiest man\"\" speech; Roger Maris breaking the Babe's home-run record; Pete Gray, the St. Louis Brown's one-armed outfielder; Ted William's final at-bat when he went out in grand style, ending his career with a home run, and other classic moments in baseball history.","popularity":0.2668,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The \"Boys of Summer\" from the Games' Golden Age","title":"Reel Baseball: Baseball's Golden Era the Way Americans Witnessed It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Musial","original_name":"Stan Musial","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/qNrqRb7HCoqxSXKUZwMOe60sWri.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c749251416c7511ae39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babe Ruth","original_name":"Babe Ruth","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/fdbzzwlIneXrtxMyz27VKLkOhn6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c749251416c7511ae3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe DiMaggio","original_name":"Joe DiMaggio","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/p5rGkPvRcDbpr8P6rDKMWaIrMnv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c749251416c7511ae41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Gehrig","original_name":"Lou Gehrig","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/pWv7vLTNgpwUsompQP5zv1lwG0k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c749251416c7511ae45","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Williams","original_name":"Ted Williams","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/AoUJDltT9rVgRRZmjIkBrsgxh3u.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c749251416c7511ae49","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":159289,"name":"historical event"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
