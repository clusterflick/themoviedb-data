After years of severe failure, Dr. Docatto is about to throw in the towel all together, when he comes up with an idea so wild, so nutty, and so hair-brained, that he is sure it will secure his place in the history books!  The theory: Cats always land on their feet, so if one were to take two cats, and attach them together, back-to-back, one cat wouldn't be able to do so, thus, the cats would fly, and he would have invented the worlds first Anti-Gravity Propulsion machine!  He attaches two cats together but doesn't bother testing the theory before inviting, colleagues, the media, and the citizens of Jamestown to witness the unveiling!","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Reprise Is Coming...","title":"Doctor Docatto's Reprise!!!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
