Keelta a young Irish woman leaves home to build a new life for herself on the road where Billy, the old Irish labourer is struggling to find a meaning to his life. Peggy, a 95 year old Jewish refugee from Vienna and Brigitte, a German born former air hostess, have both suffered bad husbands, whilst Iqbal, an unassuming Indian hotel concierge, awaits the arrival of his wife from Kashmir. A film that forces you to recognise the struggles and preoccupations of its characters as our own.","popularity":0.2417,"poster_path":"/NvKiDUIlTnK1uCmoBYxK58Anvy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road A Story of Life and Death","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Isaacs","original_name":"Marc Isaacs","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/j8ttMWou4rObhBEYkIvb7jSQX83.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c709251416c7511a867","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iqbal Ahmed","original_name":"Iqbal Ahmed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c709251416c7511a86b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Isaacs","original_name":"Marc Isaacs","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/j8ttMWou4rObhBEYkIvb7jSQX83.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c709251416c7511a863","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2669872","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/NvKiDUIlTnK1uCmoBYxK58Anvy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Road: A Story of Life and Death - Official Trailer","key":"4s9OSJKSFIM","published_at":"2013-01-24T13:56:18.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec707c3a368544800a53d"}]}}}
