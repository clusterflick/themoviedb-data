With the senior center as a stage, the elders who participated in the workshops enacted social, political and geographical imaginaries for the camera. Through improvisation and performance exercises drawn from the work of Viola Spolin and Augusto Boal, themes emerge: the dynamics of the U.S.- Mexico border, the desire to be seen, the role of musical storytelling as a soundtrack to daily life, power dynamics, and gender as performance. As the boundaries between rehearsal, improvisation, and performance blur, the ways in which individual lives and sociopolitical realities merge together are foregrounded.","popularity":0.2339,"poster_path":"/s97q1kItWPE3UD6K5mPGLUL7A6U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salidas y Entradas | Exits and Entrances","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3636032,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrés Martínez","original_name":"Andrés Martínez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6402135b58361b0085f177aa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":939501,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Dapkins","original_name":"Chris Dapkins","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6402134158361b00bc5a0694","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947450,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amanda Toyosima","original_name":"Amanda Toyosima","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640213729f1be7008ebee2f6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Hankey","original_name":"Jessica Hankey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640212ef278d8a0086e3a1f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3928552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Johnson","original_name":"Erin Johnson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/d2SAjR4xAwXJAJlfGAW57IzE7bs.jpg","credit_id":"640212d988b14800d67f9cf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3936720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Snyder","original_name":"David Snyder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64021385699fb70096009a50","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rnYBycVK2NHxYVvycz5xvlhVg6A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s97q1kItWPE3UD6K5mPGLUL7A6U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1556,"name":"texas"},{"id":5616,"name":"usa–mexico border"},{"id":255974,"name":"multi-channel"},{"id":312416,"name":"elders"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
