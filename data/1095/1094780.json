Our story opens in the remote Mýrar cemetery in the West Fjords. The narrator is standing by her forefathers´ grave, which is overgrown and neglected and she senses her dead ancestors call out and implore her to do something. Beautiful irons cross lies on the grave of a young boy who died in the middle of the nineteenth century. Her curiosity aroused, the narrator discovers the story behind the iron cross memorial by talking to the archaeologist, Gunnar Bollason. She then goes on to discover similar iron crosses in cemeteries elsewhere in the southwest of the country.  We visit the town of Þingeyri and watch as the broken iron cross from the family grave is repaired by the skilled craftsmanship of Kristján Gunnarsson at his engineering workshop, a workplace with an unbroken tradition going all the way back to 1913.","popularity":0.1038,"poster_path":"/gE9myYUkZT00zP1a5892TxBus6P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Iron Cross at Mýrar Cemetery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Birna Hafstein","original_name":"Birna Hafstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6402932b383df200835a6845","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sigrún Jónsdóttir Franklín","original_name":"Sigrún Jónsdóttir Franklín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029347383df200d9057098","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296972,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","original_name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029335021cee0079d111a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Styrmir Sigurðsson","original_name":"Styrmir Sigurðsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6402937813654500965c3bd3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296972,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","original_name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6402938267dcc900826d99ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2603124,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helgi Svavar Helgason","original_name":"Helgi Svavar Helgason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6402939a383df20086938420","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gunnar Árnason","original_name":"Gunnar Árnason","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640293bee61e6d007ce188dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296972,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","original_name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6402935a383df200d90570a8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104949,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kjartan Kjartansson","original_name":"Kjartan Kjartansson","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640293b5e61e6d00963b5ffc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6402936f021cee0079d111eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Styrmir Sigurðsson","original_name":"Styrmir Sigurðsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640293a513654500791b039c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296972,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","original_name":"Guðbergur Davíðsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029360136545008ce8a38d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948161,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daníel Friðrik Böðvarsson","original_name":"Daníel Friðrik Böðvarsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029390021cee00810d8c9a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gE9myYUkZT00zP1a5892TxBus6P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
