What does the belly dancing, horror movie fanatic, Guðrún think about the endless relationship status updates? How does the nurse student Gunnar describe how users can discover your superhero match?. Does Facebook really connect different people with similar interests? Or are its users guilty of cyber-stalking and spying? Six young Icelanders tell about their lives on- and offline, how Facebook has become a major factor in their social communications. Even if the cyber-world is here to stay, viewers can’t help but wonder how long this fast-growing communication program will last. The movie was shot in March 2009, at which time 45% of Icelandic population were facebook users. Almost all individuals between the ages 20-30 were active users and in every café, every bus and school people were talking about it.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faceland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ragnar Eyþórsson","original_name":"Ragnar Eyþórsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029f6913654500846afbd4","department":"Crew","job":"Post-Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ása Baldursdóttir","original_name":"Ása Baldursdóttir","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029f4ae61e6d0086df49cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948217,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ása Baldursdóttir","original_name":"Ása Baldursdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029f4f383df200801eb493","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ása Baldursdóttir","original_name":"Ása Baldursdóttir","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029f5f39271200e5064206","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ragnar Eyþórsson","original_name":"Ragnar Eyþórsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64029f59383df200a9544d1d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
