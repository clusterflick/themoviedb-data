Researchers and scholars James S. Valliant and Warren Fahy take us on a journey, piecing together various physical archaeological artifacts that link the ruling Roman elites of the first century to the first Christians - a link which remained hidden till now. They then reveal the secret ways Christianity was used by subsequent rulers to ensure the religion survived and thrived into modern times. Based on their book of the same name, the Creating Christ documentary reveals this secret conspiracy which began as a way to end the great conflict between Jews and Rome, and ended up changing the course of history, still being in use to this very day. With additional supportive research from scholars Dr. Robert Price, Professor Robert Eisenman, and Acharya Sanning / D.M. Murdock, this documentary adds even greater validity to the thesis that Rome created the New Testament.","popularity":0.5385,"poster_path":"/srEKCG2KTRucmjKmy0MgkYnEL9f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Did a powerful group of Roman elites conspire to create the New Testament?","title":"Creating Christ","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3945827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James S.
