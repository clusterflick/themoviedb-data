Дерево життя","overview":"A story about Ukrainian monumental art of the Soviet period in Mariupol. Photographer Stanislav Ivanov lived in Mariupol all his life. He studied history, streets, houses, monumental art. Some of the mosaics are more than half a century old. The \"Tree of Life\" panel - created by a team of artists led by Alla Gorska and Viktor Zaretsky - was bricked up after the death of the artist and reopened in 2008. This and other stories were collected by Stanislav Ivanov and art critic Oleksandr Chernov in the album \"All Shades of Mariupol Mosaics\". After February 24, 2022, the mosaicists, like hundreds of thousands of residents of Mariupol, became hostages of the occupying forces of the Russian Federation. In the film, we are transported to peaceful Mariupol in December 2021 and, together with Stanislav, explore the city and its mosaics, transported to a place where time and the elements seemed to be the greatest threats.","popularity":0.3806,"poster_path":"/jz6U7hAnCndjfhyXxgtqQZarVRx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suspilne Media","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smoldering.
