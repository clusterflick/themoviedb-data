All of us - especially young people - fear loneliness and isolation. Teenagers Michael and Jameson explore these haunting subjects together. As their romance blossoms, a new hallucinogenic street drug called Snorkeling concocts a fantasy where the user feels invincible. They can interact with the world without fear or inhibition - a true out-of-body experience. When taking a drug this powerful, what are the possibilities - and the dangers? Through his trippy, colorful recreation of the euphoria and tragedy of drug dependency, director Emil Nava takes us on a unique journey of adolescent self-discovery.","popularity":0.5207,"poster_path":"/sCNE2CxaIV4hXmo2pIj9noyf0Ii.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85465,"logo_path":"/oxx1bmXDQxeBsvYZmCxMtfJ5wa3.png","name":"Oddfellows
