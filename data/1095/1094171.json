Originally produced to promote tourism in North America, these films are remediated by the filmmaker to create an abstract collage via the emulsion lifting/ emulsion grafting technique. Using this method, the filmmaker lifts by hand the emulsion layer from the film base and subsequently places it on a different film base. This way a celluloid collage is created, then re-animated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vx3cLgt6gcO65XSGv8BsmcttkQX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skyscraper Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2773786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federica Foglia","original_name":"Federica Foglia","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lDWBsWmry9JI9TKXvHX62UUbq9I.jpg","credit_id":"6400e7b89f1be70086a01849","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":956,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vx3cLgt6gcO65XSGv8BsmcttkQX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":636},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bN3W3eO3qDTSzb8VaJnLCIbtXQG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":654}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2023-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
