The image at a given instant is repeated both on the image track and soundtrack, so that the viewer is visualizing the image he is hearing. However, unlike SOUNDTRACK, the images and sounds in SIX LOOP-PAINTINGS are not painted; they are made by cutting to size and pasting acetate self-adhesive patterns (Micotape and Zipatone) directly onto the clear film. Each pattern yields a distinct sound. Patterns of lines yield square wave sounds; patterns of dots yield sine wave sounds; patterns of diamonds yield sawtooth wave sounds, etc. The finer the pattern, the higher pitched the tone. The further spaced the pattern, the deeper the tone.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/hPuqedrvj2QGaSEctRWogyvJa4m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six Loop Paintings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Spinello","original_name":"Barry Spinello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640185c69f1be7008ebea02a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hPuqedrvj2QGaSEctRWogyvJa4m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
