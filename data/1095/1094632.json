Par mīlestību un brīvību","overview":"Just like the novel 1984, film 2020 is not about a calendar year, although it is about unique events. The year 2020 serves as a backdrop for a conversation about freedom and unfreedom, starting on the eve of 2020 with Mikhail Gorbachev and continued by Latvian theatre director Alvis Hermanis; documentary filmmaker Vitaly Mansky, who emigrated from Russia to Latvia; actress Chulpana Hamatova, who was once a confidante of Vladimir Putin; and actor and artistic director Yevgeny Mironov. Together, they create a theatrical production on freedom and a man who gave everyone equal opportunities to enjoy it.","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertov","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":386,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2020.
