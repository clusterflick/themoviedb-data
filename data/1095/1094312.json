The deep sea encompasses more than 90% of the planets habitat. Yet we know less about these depths than about the moon. This film documents the technical, scientific, and ecological challenges of deep sea researchers. Scientists work worldwide together to collect data on the physical state of the upper ocean. With more than 3000 autonomous floats they monitor the oceans for influences on weather systems like El Nino or the monsoon. Does it affect global climate change? Does the deep sea offer solutions for the CO2 issue? Researchers in the Okinawa Trough are trying to find out. The sea floor harbors enormous amounts of resources: oil, natural gas, methane. Scientists work hard to try and locate these materials. Millions of deep sea dwellers are waiting for their discovery. The Census of Marine Life is trying to catalogue these bizarre ocean creatures before they disappear.","popularity":0.4684,"poster_path":"/oUEbjCGBTzuQ3B3bOzmQBpaEOQt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Deep Sea: Shedding Light in the Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274787,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annette Scheurich","original_name":"Annette Scheurich","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640120e57a4ee700863a72dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oUEbjCGBTzuQ3B3bOzmQBpaEOQt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":658,"name":"sea"},{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":2769,"name":"deep sea"},{"id":4759,"name":"exploration"},{"id":162350,"name":"ocean floor"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
