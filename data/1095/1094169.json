The images seen mix with thoughts, occasionally fail, are sketchy. Only certain parts of the path are perceived and when you remember, these snapshots form a collage of some sort. With the technique of photogrammetry in Urban Dreamscape, these parts are captured and staged in such a way that they empathize with this phenomenon. Many individual photos are used to create 3D objects. These are edited, merged, and distorted. A dream landscape arises.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vF27KUK4WOBv4m6lxdO5892fzZp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Dreamscape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Gebbe","original_name":"Nicolas Gebbe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xtm6gz7FH2eT6MgTGYToqyrZqdv.jpg","credit_id":"6400e65c699fb70087751d1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vF27KUK4WOBv4m6lxdO5892fzZp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfest Dresden","release_date":"2020-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2023-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
