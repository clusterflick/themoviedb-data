Against the busy backdrop of their art practice, we sit in on their quiet rural life, which, in its proximity to nature and the vast green and oceanic spaces that surround, echoes the romanticism of a simpler time.  As the decaying world of physical labour and the mechanical industry faces up to an expanding digital empire, Jon gradually retreats into the alternative realities of his own design.","popularity":0.2922,"poster_path":"/f9D9cHwpzmSui69P7Kk38GzHc2u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imglick","origin_country":""},{"id":1364,"logo_path":null,"name":"St. Nick Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A cinema vérité view into the lives of young couple developing MORPGs and VR games in a remote fishing town in rural Nova Scotia.","title":"Plains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Carroll","original_name":"Jonathan Carroll","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64024129699fb7007d8fc1b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cat Bluemke","original_name":"Cat Bluemke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6402415c699fb7008f9cedfd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4359151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Creaser","original_name":"Tommy Creaser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6547e736d8cc4a00e3cc1684","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4359154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Drake","original_name":"Albert Drake","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6547e743924ce600e53f56bb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3779450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Speigel","original_name":"Eli Speigel","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6547e77c924ce600adaf6b55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romanne Walker","original_name":"Romanne Walker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640240d9699fb7008f9cedc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3779450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Speigel","original_name":"Eli Speigel","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd73da6d4c97012e8a45ea","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28138170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f9D9cHwpzmSui69P7Kk38GzHc2u.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4563,"name":"virtual reality"},{"id":5829,"name":"nova scotia, canada"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":190756,"name":"cinéma vérité"},{"id":228988,"name":"slow cinema"},{"id":249983,"name":"video game development"},{"id":251619,"name":"rural"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Plains (Trailer)","key":"623712735","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-05T18:58:59.000Z","id":"6547eaa3d8cc4a013a7b057f"}]}}}
