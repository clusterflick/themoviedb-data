Accompanied by appropriate music (the sonatas are not silent), each one moves through a period of time and place. Summer takes place in my first primarily annual garden. Joanna McClure is seen moving among the brilliant annual flower colors. Winter is a misty, mood-filled exploration of the Sonoma County hills and small lakes. The time is somewhere around 1985 and is a true document of a part of what was happening in my life at that time (Canyon Cinema)","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/f8YeWXMyNmLkOrcwA4TyhnXuxEj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Sonatas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","credit_id":"64012159c7176d00a8e94b5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f8YeWXMyNmLkOrcwA4TyhnXuxEj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
