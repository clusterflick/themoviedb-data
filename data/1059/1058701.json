The film offers a stirring glimpse into how oneâs course in life can be changed by a total stranger with seemingly no cultural similarities. The fansâ stories are revealed by the devoted themselves, providing powerful portraits of their obsession and transformative journeys. The camera follows these fans to Smiths tribute shows, Morrissey fan conventions and into Latino neighborhoods and family homes where the influence of the British pop icon resounds. One-on-one interviews with the fans are interspersed with personal archival materials including fanzines, fliers, and photographs, as well as live-footage from tribute bands such as Sweet and Tender Hooligans and These Handsome Devils.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nGBvoFJg9zqsqHzEQPUGOUvi6Ny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urban Cowgirl Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passions Just Like Mine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Juan Rodriguez","original_name":"Juan Rodriguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390f967d7107e008cebeb65","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerri Koch","original_name":"Kerri Koch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390f941cede69007d618736","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406247,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Juan Rodriguez","original_name":"Juan Rodriguez","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390f955d34eb300ef914057","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerri Koch","original_name":"Kerri Koch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390f8ee0e44190090338bbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1338654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nGBvoFJg9zqsqHzEQPUGOUvi6Ny.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
