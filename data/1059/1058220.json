Practices include quickly finding or identifying the substance the person on which the person has overdosed and traveling to a hospital or other treatment site immediately. Several simulations of different situations are shown, and the narrator asks the viewer what he or she would do differently. It provides an excellent overview of the basic prehospital approach to an overdosed patient. The initial field management of a patient is covered, accompanied by well-done scenarios illustrating incorrect technique. Although the inclusion of more medical detail would have been beneficial, this is a compelling presentation which is highly recommended for use.","popularity":0.1587,"poster_path":"/6RRRMc1bshE1wKJk2geGSAKAEaD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overdose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lf7OSapEovhKEFu4AEMRYUuNcmK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6RRRMc1bshE1wKJk2geGSAKAEaD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":726,"name":"drug abuse"},{"id":2671,"name":"heroin"},{"id":2635,"name":"overdose"},{"id":41352,"name":"drug overdose"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
