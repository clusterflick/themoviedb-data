Nearly eight centuries after his death, Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi, Sufi master and mystical poet, is ever-present in the whirling ceremony of today’s Mevlevi dervishes.  The Halveti zikr, Mevlevi semas, and the Gharib, or secret, sema-not seen for over 100 years-were filmed in Cairo, Istanbul, and the Garden of Rumi in Konya.  This unique footage set to Mevlevi music is enhanced by interviews with Sheikh Abu Bakr Siraj ad-Din (Martin Lings), Islamic philosopher and author Seyyed Hossein Nasr, and Sheikh Omer Tugrel Inancer, who reveals the hidden meaning of the reed flute.","popularity":0.4558,"poster_path":"/jz9kg96WqmcigEYwIB5dI6N1gAz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archetype Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2005-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rumi: The Wings of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3820183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shems Friedlander","original_name":"Shems Friedlander","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/trMl9OmNNJu9Xdgu752R4kzXece.jpg","credit_id":"6390daf1d18fb9007bf5cc43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3820183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shems Friedlander","original_name":"Shems Friedlander","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/trMl9OmNNJu9Xdgu752R4kzXece.jpg","credit_id":"6390db0da14bef007d821ffc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820197,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Boyle","original_name":"Peter Boyle","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390db7222931a008835a727","department":"Sound","job":"Vocal Coach"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":811,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mGWDTYlbNR6itrHgRkGp6f8s0BW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1282,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jz9kg96WqmcigEYwIB5dI6N1gAz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":18071,"name":"belief in god"},{"id":41573,"name":"rumi  "},{"id":208826,"name":"sufism"},{"id":308466,"name":"islamic mysticism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Excerpts from \"Rumi: The Wings of Love\"","key":"3pnSP-VGBVo","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2010-01-28T21:53:26.000Z","id":"6390d8f05a991500d14ff701"}]}}}
