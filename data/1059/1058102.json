While Joyce Weiland’s iconic Sailboat bobbed freely on pale blue waters, McIntyre’s rusty barge rots trapped in frozen arctic permanence; heavy, unmoving, abandoned. As frozen mechanical flotsam flashes on screen we are left to wonder what, exactly, is being mourned? Perhaps community? A way of life? Our environment? Humanity itself? Barge Dirge challenges notions of legacy and memory by presenting us with only the ugliest remnants of humanity, preserved in a boundless frozen wasteland.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2dWU8vCq1HtnnGTWlnlCQlTg27f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barge Dirge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2054671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lindsay McIntyre","original_name":"Lindsay McIntyre","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/5Y1l6YHkkky5KcEETjfIstWUdew.jpg","credit_id":"638fa24ece6c4c009b9e5c45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2dWU8vCq1HtnnGTWlnlCQlTg27f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
