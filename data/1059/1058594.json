This site allowed her to explore her complex relationship with “the land.” As the daughter of displaced indigenous Palestinians, she attempts to form a proxy bond with the earth, on ground that was stolen from the displaced indigenous Shawnee people.  Closeness to the Land is video footage of hand-painted text signs that translate the word الأرض (ard) into six English words, displayed performatively in multiple locations to capture the now-invisible nature of indigenous culture in Ohio. These signs were installed on the old schoolhouse in early 2021.","popularity":1.028,"poster_path":"/mK3eFzhFbUXLwyAc3RuSYco9q6F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closeness to the Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona Gazala","original_name":"Mona Gazala","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390d1f75a991500b3ac7b1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona Gazala","original_name":"Mona Gazala","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390d20fc740d900940fb3d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820147,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ehab Sami","original_name":"Ehab Sami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390d221031deb00bedb8d97","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mK3eFzhFbUXLwyAc3RuSYco9q6F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":5277,"name":"territory"},{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":4627,"name":"earth"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":288272,"name":"land"},{"id":308462,"name":"soil"},{"id":308463,"name":"shawnee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
