The main action takes place in a rock group's studio during the visit of a few acolytes from Theatre Theatre. It is all served up in connection with Fassbinder «s notion of Antitheatre. The theme of the “mad prince” in actors» improvisations intertwines with the fate of the director and of directing in general.  The adventures of the spirit form the true tale of this film. We use only the single interior, the studio room where nothing happens aside from the pulsations of spirit. It comes to life here, and it rests, as if gaining new strength. The Mad Prince Fassbinder is, indeed, spirit. Only a free camera is capable of capturing this freedom.","popularity":0.186,"poster_path":"/l0wfPXMOyue3YtfAbvU2A3Ll1Sv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Fantom","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1988-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mad Prince: Fassbinder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniy Chorba","original_name":"Evgeniy Chorba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fassbinder","credit_id":"64e8bae045819900e3529a42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2347349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valery Svetlov","original_name":"Valery Svetlov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yHJ1ByMKn0ao5bhBgbpmI6ep2tL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"joker","credit_id":"64e8baeb5258ae014df24775","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garik Osipov","original_name":"Garik Osipov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"devil","credit_id":"64e8bafcc3c89100c682b6ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Yufit","original_name":"Evgeny Yufit","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/8hBGhZcmMfeQcoJLSMwn0Z5jbSn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"monster","credit_id":"64e8bb08594c9400e25fb5a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2212259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gennady Abramov","original_name":"Gennady Abramov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/o9rZBak5gR4xeH76ME8MpHtOIzv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Andrey Tarkovsky","credit_id":"64e8bb1445819900ada9153c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4000523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniy Kalachov","original_name":"Evgeniy Kalachov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64e8bb3106f984014e6858db","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3117028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Yukhananov","original_name":"Boris Yukhananov","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/jG3n2v4UtxjWVANze9bBzHIxGCE.jpg","credit_id":"64e8bb59e894a601012117f2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gleb Aleynikov","original_name":"Gleb Aleynikov","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/jpMG0Ts3LNOtPDzphoQK2VWlQ5K.jpg","credit_id":"64e8bb8406f98400eb5fb84e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleksandr Dulerayn","original_name":"Александр Дулерайн","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/lS8D9k49dsZ5lU96xCKGzQF7qMt.jpg","credit_id":"64e8bb8bc3c89100c682b6e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3117028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Yukhananov","original_name":"Boris Yukhananov","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/jG3n2v4UtxjWVANze9bBzHIxGCE.jpg","credit_id":"64e8bb95594c9400c5536954","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3117028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Yukhananov","original_name":"Boris Yukhananov","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/jG3n2v4UtxjWVANze9bBzHIxGCE.jpg","credit_id":"64a6dfb52b531d0126ba8639","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":663,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f8qILNFqt4V8wxwjVipeI2XJgxh.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":442},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mocM1XG2m8lkdCeNuuQDOiDJtfK.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l0wfPXMOyue3YtfAbvU2A3Ll1Sv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nx7WxxpDMg8WPBb96S90nWvBlmc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
