It is the first time that Paradise is being shown as an artwork outside of its staging in the ballet. The soundtrack is a digital simulation of Thomas Adès’s orchestrated score Paradiso. Known technically as a MIDI, the computer simulation became an invaluable tool while the orchestra were unable to record the music during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Paradise was filmed in the extended format Cinemascope and is entirely abstract, drawing on the circular and planetary motifs present in Dante’s ‘Paradiso’. The film’s rich colours were taken from the palette of William Blake (b. 1757 – d. 1827, London) and can also be seen in the ten hand-printed silkscreen prints representing the planetary states in the corridor.","popularity":0.1079,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tacita Dean","original_name":"Tacita Dean","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63902b20fd140b00cd6d6190","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trevor Tweeten","original_name":"Trevor Tweeten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63902b34bc8abc00bbc21463","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1709012,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Adès","original_name":"Thomas Adès","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63902b45bc8abc00bbc21476","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
