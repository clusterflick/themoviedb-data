Addicts discuss their experiences in the United States and in Vietnam. Dr. Stanley Yolles, director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), talks about the drug culture and the NIMH role in prevention and treatment. The tape describes growth in the use of marijuana and heroin. In 1966, the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act is the first law to give the addict a choice of treatment or jail. Synanon in California is a private, self-help, residential community that helps people deal with their addictions. New York's Daytop Village works not only with addicts on addictions, but on developing a new lifestyle. Methadone, though still experimental, has proved to be an effective treatment for heroin addiction.","popularity":1.1904,"poster_path":"/b6dSeSklj1wYJq6whHSJWPo7bYf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Distant Drummer: Bridge from No Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Steiger","original_name":"Rod Steiger","popularity":0.9423,"profile_path":"/brIyEn13q7IQr0MoNcU529roNbr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63910880383df200b2ac0ced","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Templeton","original_name":"William Templeton","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639107bdfc31d30087f520e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan Peterson","original_name":"Dan Peterson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639107e95f2b8d00850bece2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b6dSeSklj1wYJq6whHSJWPo7bYf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2671,"name":"heroin"},{"id":1803,"name":"drug addiction"},{"id":6782,"name":"addiction"},{"id":10776,"name":"marijuana"},{"id":10649,"name":"drug rehabilitation"},{"id":186711,"name":"methadone"},{"id":308480,"name":"lexington kentucky"},{"id":308481,"name":"daytop"},{"id":308482,"name":"synanon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"The Distant Drummer:  Bridge from No Place\"   1969 Drug Education","key":"PeNeb_XYG_s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-18T18:17:22.000Z","id":"639103b95f2b8d0094a73198"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Distant Drummer: Bridge from No Place (ca. 1970)","key":"KHJE5Rx118c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-05-22T01:22:41.000Z","id":"639108565f2b8d00850becef"}]}}}
