A man's voice speaks and names the objects and places. Memories appear. An orphan is waiting alone in the hall among luggage. His infancy emanates from the objects and the perspectives subjectively visualized by the authors. Fragments of stories. Condensed emotions. People are suddenly frightening. Video technology draws a map of passages from the real to the imaginary, from truth to the narration of the present, the probability of cathode imagery.","popularity":0.1403,"poster_path":"/tjyK6ZmLO37nJz6JVSpvYFBGcvp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252421,"logo_path":null,"name":"M.I.
