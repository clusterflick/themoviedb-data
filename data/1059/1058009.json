Asked to write a script about her own experience, she constructs an ‘autobiography’ which is partly fiction. A photographer – who has never touched a camera. A peep-show girl who has never worked in one. A screenwriter who has never written dialogue.  Meanwhile, her unsent letters to her father echo the questions every migrant is asked: ‘Why are you here?’ and ‘When are you going back?’  The film is a critique of certain aspects of British culture & addresses crises of identity.","popularity":0.1545,"poster_path":"/vSI74qU03FOcvwdWnRDCsOqRhyR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey of No Return","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Harwood","original_name":"Victoria Harwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"63b6fba573520500a78e6fe0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Landis","original_name":"Harry Landis","popularity":0.197,"profile_path":"/IzOI3cYwZrpeljOPhhOYjgFer1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"63b6fbbff44f27007d7011be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Vaughan","original_name":"James Vaughan","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rupert","credit_id":"63b6fc63f44f2700a02077bd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitra Tabrizian","original_name":"Mitra Tabrizian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f55ef04733f00e3645690","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.758,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vSI74qU03FOcvwdWnRDCsOqRhyR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":775}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
