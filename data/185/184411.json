Mickey gets the idea of building barricades to give our gang space to play at an intersection, but a beat cop, the nasty \"Hard-Boiled\" McManus, puts a quick end to that. A sympathetic constable and a detective who has kids of his own give our gang a chance to help law enforcement. The little rascals wear uniforms and keep an eye on things: Joe, for instance, eyes the bananas at Tony's fruit stand. When the now-fired McManus returns and seeks revenge, the junior police force and their adult colleagues are put to the test.","popularity":0.3622,"poster_path":"/l29602rWT3K6Lzx1r2uQkwplutn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Official Officers","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cobb","original_name":"Joe Cobb","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/1tbc8vvi0Rx8sIsxUSPLraiuchV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"61d5f9429defda004290167e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Condon","original_name":"Jackie Condon","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/7TtxlaKJPtV7kS1A5TWv6S23gvZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jackie","credit_id":"61d5f94cd48cee001cef8daf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Daniels","original_name":"Mickey Daniels","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/kYS1wlzxNiRq7oZf9w9f8Sdd6y7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mickey","credit_id":"61d5f95652dc7f00a4fa74ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Downs","original_name":"Johnny Downs","popularity":0.207,"profile_path":"/xORASNJqLZUiT7e9c76oljPbQ5h.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"61d5f962e10f46001cf3547f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen 'Farina' Hoskins","original_name":"Allen 'Farina' Hoskins","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/dpRqNv9R1k2YFVWaplHsBFNu086.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Farina","credit_id":"61d5f971bb2602005b99a733","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kornman","original_name":"Mary Kornman","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/xl7dNI3feY6Mv3Xyxr2JA9iQuAM.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"61d5f97e459ad600416be267","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert F.
