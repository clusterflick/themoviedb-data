The teacher leaves the room, putting a turtle in charge. While she's gone, things go fine for a while, but the ape starts an all-out book tossing brawl. As the teacher returns, everyone suddenly stops, and although the room is a shambles, she congratulates them on behaving and dismisses them for the day.","popularity":0.3281,"poster_path":"/lVgVi86TBvYQ6R80wZQkPqmUSGt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13754,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Telefilm Associates (NTA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Elephant Never Forgets","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124f55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":606084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Fleischer","original_name":"Max Fleischer","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/m4i8FwtAeh3u1J01cdFsCf0G6VB.jpg","credit_id":"66545494f57db61bc9992de2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"665454a22f6cd9e1518cd4c9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120751,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Roland Crandall","original_name":"Roland Crandall","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665454ad25718a26ff992d45","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sammy Timberg","original_name":"Sammy Timberg","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665454bbcae8ba7849b4bd68","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4723715,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jack Scholl","original_name":"Jack Scholl","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665454d0a5ee954ea98cd3e9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0026310","wikidata_id":"Q48744266","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oSD40q5ZxeEvmj7MlneQKVdy5ff.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.642,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lVgVi86TBvYQ6R80wZQkPqmUSGt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":642}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
