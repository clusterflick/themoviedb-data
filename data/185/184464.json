Exploring his brother’s reasons for involvement with drugs and car theft, the director exposes parts of his own family history, listening to relatives and friends, whose testimonies bring to light the fates of several characters, mapping the history of painful emotional wounds.","popularity":0.0875,"poster_path":"/1pBlZqALqkNEtNfe7UY6ezIIAGp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bela Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Killed My Brother","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristiano Burlan","original_name":"Cristiano Burlan","popularity":0.0937,"profile_path":"/wPcy35WU23mEJkuESK4qww4pI8x.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc09251416c75124833","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167529,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalia Reis","original_name":"Natalia Reis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cc09251416c75124839","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167530,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rafael Nobre","original_name":"Rafael Nobre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cc09251416c7512483f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167531,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lincoln Péricles","original_name":"Lincoln Péricles","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/7JL9Prjjf8cO9XuIrNFOqFj4khN.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc09251416c75124845","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2948414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zBDSHR4dFuSEvJeX2D43u07ZmKo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1533,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/1pBlZqALqkNEtNfe7UY6ezIIAGp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1026}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
