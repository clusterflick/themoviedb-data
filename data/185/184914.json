In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that.\"[","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manowar: Hell On Earth III","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
