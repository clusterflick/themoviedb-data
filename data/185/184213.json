As the story opens, the soldiers watch a newsreel, which includes the opera singer Galli Cur (a spoof of Amelita Galli-Curci) sing an aria. After the show, they go to the local bar and tell each other the stories behind the reason they joined the legion. All the stories are about how women did them wrong in one way or another. They all agree that they are fed up with women, until a certain visitor shows up.","popularity":0.3313,"poster_path":"/sE0rc7x5PbKbFycuzmTQU9qgttQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love-Tails of Morocco","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zion Myers","original_name":"Zion Myers","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/rlMIDakDxHkOEi9UQnJfGD8wJHH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Various (voice)","credit_id":"57b04b2e9251411b3b001acd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules White","original_name":"Jules White","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/ivf31e6sR9ZynniQocdUEHV3aKv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Various (voice)","credit_id":"57b04b3e925141235d00390b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules White","original_name":"Jules White","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/ivf31e6sR9ZynniQocdUEHV3aKv.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cb99251416c75123995","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zion Myers","original_name":"Zion Myers","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/rlMIDakDxHkOEi9UQnJfGD8wJHH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cb99251416c7512398f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29967,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Axt","original_name":"William Axt","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c30cf750e0a2655ee40cf4a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0244046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sE0rc7x5PbKbFycuzmTQU9qgttQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uw9u9CpzYbvnODr1uiZXiCa25LC.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5rDW0dnGSlj7bwJLeU93APDAkhr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2905,"name":"foreign legion"},{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":263412,"name":"dogville"},{"id":337384,"name":"woman troubles"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
