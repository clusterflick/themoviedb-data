The stage is a boxing ring. Those actors who are \"onstage\" get into the boxing ring and assault each other with words. Others heckle and cheer at the sidelines, or act as a rhythm-and-blues chorus while changing costumes or wigs. Taking as its coda Andy Warhol's dictum that everyone gets fifteen minutes of fame, actor transformations depict the Breakdown of Japanese values and selfhood due to an obsession with popular American culture.","popularity":0.194,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Age Comes Riding on a Circus Elephant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Jidai wa sākasu no zō ni notte '84","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mie","original_name":"未唯mie","popularity":0.1532,"profile_path":"/ouuI8BdU2NplwbDCJv9TcUUfaSg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61359fcafd4a960087541614","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koichi Makigami","original_name":"巻上公一","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/pn3uPPCnfuOqKjmOasEFZ37CbSH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58022bfe9251417c56000d66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1694852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyôko Takami","original_name":"高見恭子","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/rt30EmvCMgFQEhx63CVYItPTyUB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58022c2bc3a3684d49001a6c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noriyuki Suzuki","original_name":"Noriyuki Suzuki","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6135a074e3fa2f00430ec4f2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sakumi Hagiwara","original_name":"萩原朔美","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3NKQewwbo6VY6WzOa9qCLVVg0rN.jpg","credit_id":"61359ef9e93e95002bbd3b7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shūji Terayama","original_name":"寺山修司","popularity":0.2033,"profile_path":"/n2zFgMKGmniENJIDijCA4koXRcj.jpg","credit_id":"58022bce9251417a33000cf8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2983544","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
