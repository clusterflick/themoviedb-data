After his sermon, he brings out a pie and cuts it into small slices. The two men at the end of the line get none. They leave the mission and head for a garbage dump where junk becomes props for their play. A dress form becomes Mae West; a rusted car gives them a wild ride. Then, one dresses as a priest and promises pie in the sky. By the end, they sport metal halos.","popularity":0.0924,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pie in the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":6.375,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Collins","original_name":"Russell Collins","popularity":0.2892,"profile_path":"/rRDRvPma2GuddGlCfCMrWHyBDN4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5af13aebc3a36837ae0033ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elia Kazan","original_name":"Elia Kazan","popularity":0.4026,"profile_path":"/4Hu3AoSEYrdgzwkwYu7ry683uFj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5af13af79251411ecf0027f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irving Lerner","original_name":"Irving Lerner","popularity":0.208,"profile_path":"/3ovHPVyUn1gu5ynANyvufFUikrd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5af13b08c3a36837bd002d74","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Steiner","original_name":"Ralph Steiner","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5af13b189251411ec2002f06","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Steiner","original_name":"Ralph Steiner","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cc29251416c75124ac9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0191356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
