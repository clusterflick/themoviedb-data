A couple of gags that may have been created by Avery include: Oswald asking a lady to take off her hat as it's blocking his view but getting even more blocked when her hair suddenly grows into a giant afro! Also, as the trapeze artist spins around on his swing, so too do the audiences' heads from top to bottom! That's all the inventive stuff I saw in this cartoon, still Towne Hall Follies is worth a look for any Avery fans out there.","popularity":0.1747,"poster_path":"/uzxOuk6C6UJfOsn50Fmwk0n0Mcq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Towne Hall Follies","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc29251416c75124be1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tex Avery","original_name":"Tex Avery","popularity":0.5622,"profile_path":"/4jimJwW6FNAxBuM2CD1cZLK6Q5C.jpg","credit_id":"67b2073e6113c493dc6da90b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932745,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ray Abrams","original_name":"Ray Abrams","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2074b6510be227fe0e14d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Dietrich","original_name":"James Dietrich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b207646113c493dc6da91f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142925","wikidata_id":"Q3535959","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzxOuk6C6UJfOsn50Fmwk0n0Mcq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hUpgQEZm2Q02MpyVQTLZoqV2J0g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
