The building site is like a theatre in which the former inhabitants, the neighbours, the workers, the builder and the new owner all appear. Israeli television censured the film.  \"Gitai wants this house to be both a symbol and something very concrete; he wants it to become a character in a film. He achieves one of the most beautiful things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling shell of a house, real hallucinations begin to take shape. The film's central idea is simple and the film has simply the force of that idea, no more, no less.\"","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/cf4LS1zrX8aed54LaJ7XGGQ08M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1980-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bait / House / La maison (La casa)","title":"House","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amos Gitai","original_name":"Amos Gitai","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/rzeDnQ8JSnshvhmM9hzk955Wg9R.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc59251416c7512510f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162877","wikidata_id":"Q7058269","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9XFQqcikjYQix1B0TzApAZQxMeI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fUkFnlJwgEXMN4wyR7c70peXoM9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1MVHBdCK45lmL3VGYbzvDC9xvuL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cf4LS1zrX8aed54LaJ7XGGQ08M.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
