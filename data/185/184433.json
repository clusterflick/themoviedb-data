They run into some obstacles in playing the game, including objections from parents, and as such they decide to postpone it until the wee hours of the next morning and play it in the streets of the neighborhood. As it begins to rain during the middle of their shootout that morning, they decide to take refuge in a neighborhood house. What they are unaware of is that the house belongs to inventor W.R. Jones, who rigged it to be a \"magnetic house\", a demonstration for a possible amusement park attraction. Not knowing about the house's rigged contraptions leads to a lot of misadventures for the gang not related to shooting Indians as they try to figure out what's happening around them.","popularity":0.3062,"poster_path":"/iM552QDuSPKBl4ArNeMAzUxLCUu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shootin' Injuns","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cobb","original_name":"Joe Cobb","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/1tbc8vvi0Rx8sIsxUSPLraiuchV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"5bf8635d9251415cc80f14e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Condon","original_name":"Jackie Condon","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/7TtxlaKJPtV7kS1A5TWv6S23gvZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jackie","credit_id":"5bf86367c3a36818aa0fdc91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Daniels","original_name":"Mickey Daniels","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/kYS1wlzxNiRq7oZf9w9f8Sdd6y7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mickey","credit_id":"5bf863730e0a2643200655af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Downs","original_name":"Johnny Downs","popularity":0.207,"profile_path":"/xORASNJqLZUiT7e9c76oljPbQ5h.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Johnnie","credit_id":"5bf863809251417c1d089bd1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen 'Farina' Hoskins","original_name":"Allen 'Farina' Hoskins","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/dpRqNv9R1k2YFVWaplHsBFNu086.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Farina","credit_id":"5bf8638e0e0a264cfc01f775","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Jackson","original_name":"Eugene Jackson","popularity":0.2625,"profile_path":"/7RMdrhnV73hsCiJiWyHCVlAFTDf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gene","credit_id":"5bf863b80e0a26265e108257","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kornman","original_name":"Mary Kornman","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/xl7dNI3feY6Mv3Xyxr2JA9iQuAM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5bf863c5c3a36818a310fecb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert F.
