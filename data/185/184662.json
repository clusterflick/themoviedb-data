They both come in, and whenever Olive isn't looking, they start fighting. She catches them, and tells them one will have to leave. Bluto tells Popey that whoever does the best trick can stay. As a result, they find ever more creative ways to abuse each other, much to Olive's merriment. Eventually, though, they start destroying her house, and Olive throws them both out, for a little while, anyhow.","popularity":0.4853,"poster_path":"/o5QU6INj6GQuAZ57iTnTI8ruefr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pleased to Meet Cha!","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William 'Billy' Costello","original_name":"William 'Billy' Costello","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/btioKkwULpXZ22kduYmPIHgFteZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"550de11ec3a368211c0003f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"550de153925141793a000520","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Pennell","original_name":"William Pennell","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"550de15ec3a3684877006b36","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124f5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":606084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Fleischer","original_name":"Max Fleischer","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/m4i8FwtAeh3u1J01cdFsCf0G6VB.jpg","credit_id":"5f778a67d4d509003308076d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123495,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Willard Bowsky","original_name":"Willard Bowsky","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f778a70e039f10037e59a1d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sammy Timberg","original_name":"Sammy Timberg","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f778a77f8e982003a6f3cb2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123495,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Willard Bowsky","original_name":"Willard Bowsky","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f778a7e3e2ec80037c8a1a4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934965,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Charles Hastings","original_name":"Charles Hastings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f778a917b7b4d00376a2976","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1901737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Walker","original_name":"Harold Walker","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f778aa09a64350039ab46fa","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0026871","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":807,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qE4Ni8In1QGGFsDvyvNNXlG56Za.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1434}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5QU6INj6GQuAZ57iTnTI8ruefr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cNM7lPmpnXKZBofwifshGfpYgXh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
