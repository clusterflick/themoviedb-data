The rhythms of Bhangra and Bangla music set the pace for this lively collage of interviews with British Asian youth. Mixing archival footage with present day street scenes of Asians in England, this film chronicles the role of race and cultural identity in the formation of modern day British society. I'm British but... is an engaging critique of nationalisms of any sort and a celebration of cultural diversity and hybridity.","popularity":0.2168,"poster_path":"/jXGnbOOY25UhZPKKPraCa0lUHia.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm British But...","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neetinder Boparai","original_name":"Neetinder Boparai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124eeb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Apala Chowdhury","original_name":"Apala Chowdhury","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124eef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Khan","original_name":"Michael Khan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124ef3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jabeen Mohammed","original_name":"Jabeen Mohammed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124ef7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramesh Rana","original_name":"Ramesh Rana","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124efb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"San-j Sanj","original_name":"San-j Sanj","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - X-Zecutive Soundz (as San-J)","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124eff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haroon Shamsher","original_name":"Haroon Shamsher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Joi Bangla Sound (as Haroon)","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124f03","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gurinder Chadha","original_name":"Gurinder Chadha","popularity":0.683,"profile_path":"/giMqMKMIu9e9ieQoHRoqZqnWGwr.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc49251416c75124ee7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":988878,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nina Kellgren","original_name":"Nina Kellgren","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e1b473ca8354005510c640","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3639761,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Danks","original_name":"Michael Danks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e1b47948138212ca877d49","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136327,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eliza Mellor","original_name":"Eliza Mellor","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e1b48348138212ca877d4e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gurinder Chadha","original_name":"Gurinder Chadha","popularity":0.683,"profile_path":"/giMqMKMIu9e9ieQoHRoqZqnWGwr.jpg","credit_id":"62e1b46a25a536004f6d1b2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":342233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Gibson","original_name":"Ben Gibson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e1b5f3021cee004d782029","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2471621,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Moya Burns","original_name":"Moya Burns","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e1b6c815dea0004fadeb1a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0367870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jXGnbOOY25UhZPKKPraCa0lUHia.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
