His television appearances have spanned from Merv Griffin to Dick Cavett to David Letterman. His long-running Off-Broadway show was hailed as \"diabolical genius\". He is Brother Theodore. A former millionaire playboy in the late1930's of Germany, Theodore endured the sobering loss of his entire family, his fortune, and his own identity, as a survivor of Dachau concentration camp. Shipped to America humiliated and stunned, Theodore yearned to reclaim his high-status and wealth. Continually haunted by his loss, and hindered as a displaced foreigner, he tapped \"the power of despair\" to re-invent himself, capitalizing on his dark, existential humor - to become one of America's most respected humorists and monologists.","popularity":1.4716,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Unbelievable Story of Brother Theodore","title":"To My Great Chagrin: The Unbelievable Story of Brother Theodore","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Brother Theodore","type":"Documentary"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Gottlieb","original_name":"Theodore Gottlieb","popularity":0.1517,"profile_path":"/ptFZedDF5Xt7N61tJeg5wAtZYOP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cca9251416c75125b7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Allen","original_name":"Woody Allen","popularity":1.372,"profile_path":"/wcPQgZLDibuej1RwNTy1R2U2ZJw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cca9251416c75125b83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Bogosian","original_name":"Eric Bogosian","popularity":0.5732,"profile_path":"/v64I9bDweZZflNdaBVtOF3p0tB5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cca9251416c75125b87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harlan Ellison","original_name":"Harlan Ellison","popularity":0.45,"profile_path":"/cZpQf3CzimPmcoNlcAAnNSHijQI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cca9251416c75125b8b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Cavett","original_name":"Dick Cavett","popularity":0.4865,"profile_path":"/7g5J47vQY2k4GzGhlJr6KdYm04P.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cca9251416c75125b8f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Gibson","original_name":"Henry Gibson","popularity":1.0107,"profile_path":"/2Py2ZzFfTobPIHEKRYuWHhxRDqF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cca9251416c75125b93","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penn Jillette","original_name":"Penn Jillette","popularity":0.7932,"profile_path":"/lxMpWaVKyeqZCxENRo1wu13iSTS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cca9251416c75125b97","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Sumerel","original_name":"Jeff Sumerel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2f631a97880148f3b90df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0840297","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10939,"name":"holocaust (shoah) survivor"},{"id":267509,"name":"stand-up"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"To My Great Chagrin teaser","key":"5M95_mVgHnA","published_at":"2012-09-08T00:08:50.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec709c3a368544800a632"}]}}}
