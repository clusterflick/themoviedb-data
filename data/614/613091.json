With both critique and praise from members of the communities that have hosted Christo and his works, the film takes a deep look into the process and outcome of pieces such as Wrapped Coast, Running Fence, and Wrapped Walkways. While discussing his inspirations and motives, Christo states, “The work of art is not the fabric, steel poles and cable, the work of art is the hills and the ocean, the sky, the gates, the rocks, the people, the light- this is the work of art.” (Christo Vladimirov Javacheff) Though his work may appear to be visually distracting from the landscapes he creates in, Christo’s aim is to bring attention to the land itself and encourage people to take note of their surroundings.","popularity":0.2135,"poster_path":"/keWma3Cgq8hNypNXJ637Qzeo0dL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christo: Works in Progress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christo","original_name":"Christo","popularity":0.1022,"profile_path":"/l97vImuBfnjVIb9nHsHqNiJ9PTX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b0ce4a9638640092ff773d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"62b0ce08eb0932009253597e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11383350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/keWma3Cgq8hNypNXJ637Qzeo0dL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":6024,"name":"sculpture"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
