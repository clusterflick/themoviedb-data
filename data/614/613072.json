Aiming to become a cardiologist, she performs part of her residency in a chronically understaffed hospital emergency room. During a particularly difficult shift, she makes a mistake that causes the death of a patient. Judith is devastated and doubts whether she is suited to the profession. Her fellow doctors, including her partner Mark, advise her to just carry on as before. While Judith’s actions are investigated, she is assigned to ambulance duty. Being in a new environment and having some distance to the clinical routine allow her to see things in a new light.","popularity":1.819,"poster_path":"/zMp1UhOeVlWylGDzHKmgBHSMM9M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19426,"logo_path":"/m36J2sXPUPwmh69h3bjzHeUL6jx.png","name":"die film gmbh","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Menschenmögliche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Notärztin","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alissa Jung","original_name":"Alissa Jung","popularity":0.4227,"profile_path":"/osb7MI83lUCDLwrupkXf9AWGRXd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Judith Asmussen","credit_id":"5d2667dd37b3a94f3f53034c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lasse Myhr","original_name":"Lasse Myhr","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":"/khVowuBzn4xwlH9iukUfsLrZgRZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stefan","credit_id":"5d2667f737b3a94f06530c7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torben Liebrecht","original_name":"Torben Liebrecht","popularity":0.4628,"profile_path":"/2wOsGzDKRbKA5phd4o5zkx6lzIS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mark","credit_id":"5d2668169ae613000ff26bc0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2062417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathrin Kestler","original_name":"Kathrin Kestler","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/3UupBTfeeW3Y5wI9iYC096wJnlf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Schwester Katja","credit_id":"5d2668349ae613000ff26c1c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Urhausen","original_name":"Brigitte Urhausen","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/tGPwVrkS7HSgUBWGMjc00yZoISu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Iris","credit_id":"5d2668aab3316b0010951ede","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid M.
