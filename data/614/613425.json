Foster lays plans for his final theft, after which he will elope with Marguerite, although Blair lays his own plans to thwart his rival. Dispirited over Blair's lack of attention, Marguerite nonetheless calls his office before running away with Foster in a last effort to reconcile with her husband. Marguerite cannot reach Blair but does receive a message that his remoteness has been due to his job rather than \"another woman.\" When Foster then attempts to carry out his plan and knocks out Blair in the process, Marguerite does not hesitate to shoot Foster. With Foster and his gang rounded up, the Blairs reconcile.","popularity":0.2049,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":236316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Truart Film Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hurricane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Lake","original_name":"Alice Lake","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/2yqVjwChpYkjXCsQl0tnS6jsskM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"5d200ff4322b2b000e00c225","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Holmes","original_name":"Stuart Holmes","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/s22P75fI3Mt5D8TbNTIEnSuSQIX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Smuggler","credit_id":"5d200ffb94d8a8311643e4df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Richardson","original_name":"Jack Richardson","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/VS5D9sFzk4KTeFjsL1Y15Ck4yb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Husband","credit_id":"5d201004322b2b000e00c22f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2355462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Reynolds","original_name":"Muriel Reynolds","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d20100b322b2b001000c58d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Foster","original_name":"George Foster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6196ed6b4ccc500062d7bfd9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2355461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Frederick Caldwell","original_name":"John Frederick Caldwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6196ed769603310043f0b6b4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Edwards","original_name":"Donald Edwards","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6196ed7f1feac100661654da","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2355461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Frederick Caldwell","original_name":"John Frederick Caldwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d200fd215c6362e4ef37ed1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0327907","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
