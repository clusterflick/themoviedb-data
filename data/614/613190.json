He claims real men are men of many hats. In film school, he's one of the avid preachers of self-initiated absurd theory. He assumes that one can enhance the power of imagination by way of altering consciousness that, on its turn, can give way to new reality. Rene often observes life via his Handycam. Sometimes those he captures are not only the 'real' people, but imaginary personalities, too.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/tEFF7IWNoGWc6DHzSzACcluQ0JY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106819,"logo_path":"/pOHOEVPOBTAgOtSa3iIQEWT9xfj.png","name":"Independent Film Project","origin_country":"GE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rene Goes to Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Рене едет в Голливуд","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niko Tavadze","original_name":"Niko Tavadze","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/726dR1US4Ougq8AzAYnyRYBVbOI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rene","credit_id":"5d1e7fdc94d8a83116406371","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2354667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lasha Kankava","original_name":"Lasha Kankava","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hauna","credit_id":"5d1e7fef55b0c07f3b6e7861","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2354668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Barbakadze","original_name":"Viktor Barbakadze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ucha","credit_id":"5d1e7ffe6743fa0014d24cd0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2354669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niko Gomelauri","original_name":"ნიკო გომელაური","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Toma","credit_id":"5d1e801355b0c0638e69ff1d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleko Tsabadze","original_name":"Aleko Tsabadze","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/oupVYCHJZohxMLmpsTUVvEB0hE0.jpg","credit_id":"5d1e7fb755b0c07f3b6e7824","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1778883","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tEFF7IWNoGWc6DHzSzACcluQ0JY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
