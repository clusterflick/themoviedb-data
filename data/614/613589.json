They had 3 hit singles and a UK top 10 album already under their belts along with a string of headlining concerts, all of which had come since their relocation from New York to London in 1980. The band's combination of original songs and rockabilly classics with a punk attitude and style had caught the moment to perfection. Added to this were their considerable musical accomplishments and knack for songwriting. All in all it was a heady concoction and the crowd in Montreux reacted with near hysterical excitement, something rarely seen in what is usually a polite and reserved audience. This is the Stray Cats at their peak.","popularity":0.3364,"poster_path":"/bS6JNwkWBPo9muLHyJMvQyXiWJZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stray Cats: Live at Montreux 1981","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Setzer","original_name":"Brian Setzer","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":"/dTVXp7T4umdpBVqFrykWwHKMwou.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e12c1535907de0017df8649","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Rocker","original_name":"Lee Rocker","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/zlllegB05VWhSnhaeHVZ4OGLOWV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e12c159fc5f0600159097fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1844864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Jim Phantom","original_name":"Slim Jim Phantom","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":"/eCUfGSdlEyNnoOCrzGLvWKtg2Ob.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e12c161d64ac2001865c7ab","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Jaquenod","original_name":"François Jaquenod","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d99a537666822ac19da314","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7osslOq26cfBltmo6ROLIOfMZBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uK9vkOoF9F7gFzCPGPwvZP0GWzs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bS6JNwkWBPo9muLHyJMvQyXiWJZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":6552,"name":"rockabilly"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
