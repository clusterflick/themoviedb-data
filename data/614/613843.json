Leben um Leben resumes the story with the honeymoon of Peter Tomson and Ellen, who earlier had played the key role in discovering Collin’s diary and clearing the name of her future husband. During their stay, they again cross paths with Carmen Metschersky, who has managed to survive her suicide attempt and was acquitted of the murder charge due to lack of sufficient evidence. Her accomplice Peppo Pastia was convicted, but later released thanks to her help. When Carmen learns that she will inherit nothing from her deceased husband’s estate, she and Peppo (posing as her uncle Pedro Costa) hatch an elaborate scheme to seduce and murder Tomson’s business partner, Kurt Frederich. However, Ellen Tomson manages to foil their machinations yet again, and the villainous pair suffer a chilling end (in the truest sense).","popularity":0.148,"poster_path":"/bbOX9YSORYC25WsbHkLP4yjBmLJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Richard Eichberg-Film GmbH","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1916-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Upon Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Life Upon Life","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Life Upon Life","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1930321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Richter","original_name":"Ellen Richter","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/A5A4nGJD67uR4Y3eBeZpooeAKqG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fürsten Carmen Metschersky","credit_id":"5d228b55b4a5430012bc49de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Kaiser-Titz","original_name":"Erich Kaiser-Titz","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/p1xCNHyzTCJO30Ia6ZPFG1U7Zt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kurt Frederich","credit_id":"5d48d5412d1e40192cbdfe75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":29008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Wolffgram","original_name":"Walter Wolffgram","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Peter Tomson","credit_id":"5d48d547028f1474ea00b294","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1518812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lu Synd","original_name":"Lu Synd","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/ofti4CVADvksQTuVczV2M3qdthJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ellen Tomson","credit_id":"5d48d54f2d1e40192cbdfe81","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Neher","original_name":"Louis Neher","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Peppo Pastia","credit_id":"5d48d5562d1e400199c10009","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Eichberg","original_name":"Richard Eichberg","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":"/bXZJzcvdTLCwSlvBSCP89I3g21L.jpg","credit_id":"5d228b6c94d8a87c123b8f97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12740,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Heinrich Gärtner","original_name":"Heinrich Gärtner","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/kH7iduhz0gnnMeceMkWQWadZNtK.jpg","credit_id":"5d48d5742d1e405db5c1af01","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2395329,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karl Schneider","original_name":"Karl Schneider","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d62065054f6eb711d9aa031","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bbOX9YSORYC25WsbHkLP4yjBmLJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":846,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/618g8oVqMtJrURxySLOtquFOTyq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
