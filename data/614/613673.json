Théo, her grad-student boyfriend, breaks up with her, and she's desolate. She house-sits for a friend for several weeks: during that time, her father arrives looking for her after 20 years, Théo realizes he misses her, and she meets the quirky Lou, a poetry-spouting squatter who introduces himself by clipping a lock of her hair during a movie; he later breaks into her flat to chat with her. She's angry with her father, confused by Théo, and delighted with Lou, whose free spirit and undemanding attention inspire her. Working out her feelings about her father gives her to key to decide what to do next.","popularity":0.2009,"poster_path":"/rAVkfiammhSAsztF7mWXRSnL7eZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Position de l'escargot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirella Tomassini","original_name":"Mirella Tomassini","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef78b76a284eb00378c65c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Lanoux","original_name":"Victor Lanoux","popularity":0.294,"profile_path":"/AuEzBr4wR5tZONg3t8z311AN5Wg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef78b7c27d9cc0038ade1a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascale Montpetit","original_name":"Pascale Montpetit","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":"/5MXTa0H1dAqEohCj9aS1DXlF0sz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef78b8139a1a6003532d262","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino Tavarone","original_name":"Dino Tavarone","popularity":0.165,"profile_path":"/enF8nqdWOonFPBSrdh6CNJTHAfw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef78b89c7176d0039a651e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Chassé","original_name":"Henri Chassé","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rb1d6ftm2N01jVaR9WtZFD5Xksx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef78b8fe93e950033b76f59","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1693074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michka Saäl","original_name":"Michka Saäl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d217ebdf794ad024c8da61b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0190655","wikidata_id":"Q30739660","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rAVkfiammhSAsztF7mWXRSnL7eZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":722}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
