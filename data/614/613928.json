The film starts with John Vane accepting a wager that he wouldn't bail up a Chinese man. Then Vane wins his bet by robbing a Chinese man, leading to headlines which say \"Robbery Under Arms by John Vane\" and Vane fleeing to the bush with his sweetheart. Later adventures include his capture and release of his sweetheart; the sticking up of the Keightley Homestead; the shooting of Michael Burke, which leads to Vane joining the Ben Hall gang; Vane's change of heart and surrender to Father McCarthy. He serves fifteen years in prison and after release retires comfortably.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1910-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"australian silent","title":"The Life and Adventures of John Vane, the Notorious Australian Bushranger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Longford","original_name":"Raymond Longford","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/aVdwiEuwLDfS1bFIzTEmWraY0IG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"John Vane","credit_id":"5d22f0a8ef4889581aea1ade","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Gerald","original_name":"Jim Gerald","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d22f07b15c6364678f339a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Vane","original_name":"Lance Vane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d22f0d76d4c973916769574","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Clifton","original_name":"Max Clifton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d22f0e56d4c97000d77e173","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356835,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ernest Higgins","original_name":"Ernest Higgins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d22efc2ef4889000fea48f0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Cozens Spencer","original_name":"Charles Cozens Spencer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d22efa615c6364f5bf7a856","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"S.
