In the third year after she started living in Germany, Shiota became sharply aware of her own skin, arguably a symbol of her own  identity. This was the first work where she made a video version of a performance. It also resonates with her 1997 performance piece, “Try and Go  Home.”","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/igv9nhEMmX3nLiMy2hk4gAdGuqX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bathroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2354681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiharu Shiota","original_name":"Chiharu Shiota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1e8c526743fa0011d26be8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/igv9nhEMmX3nLiMy2hk4gAdGuqX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
