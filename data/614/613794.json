This documentary is composed of two films that respond to each other: one is a montage of conversations that Bernard Queysanne had with some of Georges Perec's many friends. They remember above all the man: the one who wrote on any piece of paper, who excelled in the art of puns, who liked to party with his friends and who lived sometimes unhappy love affairs. The other is an adaptation of \"Espèces d'espaces\", the writer's reflections on places: rooms, buildings, streets and districts.","popularity":0.0783,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":120460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Producteurs Indépendants Associés","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Propos amicaux à propos d'espèces d'espaces","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Queysanne","original_name":"Bernard Queysanne","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/4DT2MWDlZ1uZHaaoturhWQlONvl.jpg","credit_id":"5d223f2d15c6364f5bf61f3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0382252","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
