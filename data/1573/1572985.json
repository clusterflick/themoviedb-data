The boys are drawn to the bizarre and free world of these itinerant performers, developing a desire to leave their families and dreaming of eloping together. However, these clumsy, pretentious boys, pretending to be in love, are powerless to sever the entanglements of their newly formed blood ties. It's as if miracles never exist; sacrificing the entire blood-soaked, stinking Paradise Town can neither save the world nor save the boy himself.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Dogs go to Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Dai","original_name":"Diana Dai","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690671d4fa3095ecd14c8216","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
