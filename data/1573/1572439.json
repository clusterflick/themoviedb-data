This device also allowed artists to see what they were recording in real time and to immediately play it back, prompting investigations of technology’s increasingly fluid relationship to the body, language, and time itself.  Shigeko Kubota’s ”Self-Portrait” embodied the boundless potential of the new medium and the freedom from precedent it represented.  This work, in which Kubota interacts with her own image, contains some of her earliest known experimentation with video.  Here, she used new tools to manipulate the electronic signal, creating previously unimaginable colors and patterns, and unraveling established conventions of image-making right before our eyes.
