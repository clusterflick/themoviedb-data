Romy Bélisle’s writing grants us access to her inner self, to the universal significance of the end of adolescence, to one world dying so that another can be born. Her words are paired with images of her last summer before heading toward adulthood, captured by a warm and discreet camera. These seemingly mundane fragments contrast with the breadth of emotions conveyed by her entries, and from this tension crystallizes the underlying goal of immortalizing what is about to disappear with the maturity and clarity we all wish we had.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romy tient un journal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2814501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles-Émile Lafrance","original_name":"Charles-Émile Lafrance","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zWya667tHEAJEdIskPi1r8NwK9p.jpg","credit_id":"6904beb108f8e422f9080a6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
