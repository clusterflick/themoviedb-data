The multi-channel installation draws on experimental performance, surrealism and dark humour to examine the way wellness subcultures can be co-opted to sell individualistic visions of liberty and success. A series of compelling character studies of the ‘alpha’ personalities and fitness evangelists that populate the manosphere, the work examines the psychological mechanisms of rejecting failure, vulnerability and introspection, and the pursuit of infinite growth at any cost.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5 STEPS FOR BETTER LIVING, MAXIMUM GAINS AND MANIFESTING YOUR MOST OPTIMISED SELF!!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
