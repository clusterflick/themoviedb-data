V2X takes viewers around Saigon through the eyes of the artists that live there, experiencing the city that informs and plays canvas to their music. Beginning with traditional nhạc Dân tộc Việt Nam in its many permutations, V2X explores the converging environments shaping modern Vietnamese music from experimental at home in white-walled galleries to densely packed clubs scattered around Saigon. Along with co-curators Rắn Cạp Đuôi, Vietnam's premier experimental outfit, and a lineup consisting of a mix of HCMC's best-rising talent and audio pioneers, V2X aims to show the diversity and energy of an art scene burgeoning with talent and innovation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"COSMOS Embassy: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
