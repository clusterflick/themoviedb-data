The camera lingers on the skin of her face and hands; her wrinkles are traces of stories. Alzheimer's disease is eating away at her memory. Parts of her forget, while others remember. Set against vivid and sometimes distorted compositions of her memories, excerpts of her diaries are whispered by actresses recounting her past in a Gulag forced labour camp in Siberia during the Second World War. This short film brings to life this Polish teenager's experience of deportation and the events that followed, intertwining them with her present. Her apartment is now a witness to her buried memories and her illness. Julitta is now 100 years old.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"100 Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1830940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitchell Stafiej","original_name":"Mitchell Stafiej","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904bd3e45b7cae6c8463307","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
