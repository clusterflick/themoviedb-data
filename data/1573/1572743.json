The old men who discuss politics in back of Hobart's grocery store like Abe, as does Mary Shelby, whose dress shop carries Vogue magazine and the latest New York City fashions. Feminist Aurora Noyes and her daughter Lotta arrive in town to politicize the women. Abe finds Lotta intellectually stimulating and loses interest in Mary. After war is declared, the eligible men in town enlist, Aurora ousts Joe, then convinces the townswomen to assume men's jobs and wear men's clothes, to the detriment of Mary's business.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/1c6jQhB7BeQy0M3T5civHjBAsp6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":163622,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Emerson & Anita Loos Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sorry, Mister, We've got your job!","title":"Oh, You Women!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Truex","original_name":"Ernest Truex","popularity":0.6736,"profile_path":"/8FA4y7tbIqjWpGtYRlTkh7lYy9f.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Abraham Lincoln Jones","credit_id":"6905fbbb6b9e5ac6bd4c7f29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Burke","original_name":"Joseph Burke","popularity":0.2456,"profile_path":"/2KV3eehHrskQUZJNeGOwsLvNhRB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joe Bush","credit_id":"6905fbf25cb195a961472325","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Randall","original_name":"Bernard Randall","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Alec Smart","credit_id":"6905fc106b9e5ac6bd4c7f3b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Glass","original_name":"Gaston Glass","popularity":0.4334,"profile_path":"/hvhtpjt0hieax7KRKJfuEUJ2OVy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jimmy Johnson","credit_id":"6905fc2a27f8554715597cd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1817797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Huff","original_name":"Louise Huff","popularity":0.2834,"profile_path":"/bwiPE5BqqYW4DFNdiVnMc1UpBnr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Shelby","credit_id":"6905fc476b9e5ac6bd4c7f40","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5788743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Wales","original_name":"Betty Wales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Ethel Johnson","credit_id":"6905fc5f9fc590e8bdf92769","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1796250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merceita Esmond","original_name":"Merceita Esmond","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Alice Wilson","credit_id":"6905fc884e03592f600810f6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5788749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Fitzhugh","original_name":"Ida Fitzhugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Aurora Noyes","credit_id":"6905fcad8e1886bca0463746","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Stevens","original_name":"Josephine Stevens","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/6w9eS3dcuhoaS75QHQ5gsrKZ5OR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lotta Noyes","credit_id":"6905fcca255a91d857e126e0","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":254114,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Emerson","original_name":"John Emerson","popularity":1.792,"profile_path":"/k4X2nu7187pg1ZwOCnW04eLOgLn.jpg","credit_id":"6905fb5c72dfbeea4ee1273e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":254114,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Emerson","original_name":"John Emerson","popularity":1.792,"profile_path":"/k4X2nu7187pg1ZwOCnW04eLOgLn.jpg","credit_id":"6905fb72d56b6840da4637ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11436,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Loos","original_name":"Anita Loos","popularity":0.8011,"profile_path":"/4APVlLs5pKLXsB5gliSf59kHVzF.jpg","credit_id":"6905fb7ef377f3ef00472349","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1499552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Montéran","original_name":"Jacques Montéran","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6905fb984d1c81e40cdd7e18","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1c6jQhB7BeQy0M3T5civHjBAsp6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1919-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
