The collective unconscious comes to life through the dream of an embryo, thanks to a surreal collage of archives from multiple sources. Between ultrasounds, microscopic shots, and fragments of history, the images are arranged, discussed, and unfurled like a constellation. Halfway between science fiction and philosophy, The Embryo's Dream, Upon the Moon shifts between the subtlest details and the vastest landscapes. From this montage emerges a perceptive human and spiritual meditation on memory and its many layers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Embryo's Dream, Upon the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2107859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tzuan Wu","original_name":"Tzuan Wu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rBg2jufkddyVtXzRdbFWpfQUlfn.jpg","credit_id":"6904c14b1369fc80002fddd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
