The course of the illness is told from two perspectives: that of the Polish caregiver Violetta and that of the daughter. They take turns recounting their experiences, the limits of care, excessive demands, working conditions, exploitation within the system, and death. The only filming location is the apartment, which alternates between living space, museum, and crime scene. Esser's staging reveals layers of memory and shows that remembering and forgetting are very individual processes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Proxys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64557,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katrin Esser","original_name":"Katrin Esser","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69061f95b52e69099f08109a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
