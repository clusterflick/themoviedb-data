A jazz-loving younger sister attends piano lessons, while her older brother is obsessed with drumming. The two discover the joy of music.  From the ashes of Cinema 58, a continuation of Hiroshi Teshigahara and Susumu Hani’s screening group Cinema 57, Teshigahara and Hani invited new filmmakers to join the group such as Yoshiro Kawazu, Zenzo Matsuyama, Kyushiro Kusakabe, Sadamu Maruo, Kanzaburo Mushanokoji, Masahiro Ogi, Ryuichiro Sakisaka to make Tokyo 1958.  Hani, Teshigahara and Kawazu make a promotional jazz film for an instrument maker during the vibrant 50s.
