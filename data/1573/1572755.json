Much to the consternation of Dresser's daughter Elsie, a patriotic American, Kaiser Wilhelm calls them to Berlin to begin mass production of the tonic for the German army. Elsie's boyfriend, Teddy Swift, is particularly disturbed by this turn of events and decides to earn enough money to follow her to Germany. When the United States joins the war, Teddy is among the first to enlist, and soon he finds himself in Berlin trying to help Elsie escape from prison. After several narrow escapes, the two make their way to the mustache factory and blow it up. Brought before the Kaiser, they are rescued when American troops storm the palace, and the Kaiser loses his mustache and the war.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/xS2kfRQYagVObUFKM04eX9xIYno.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":163622,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Emerson & Anita Loos Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good-Bye, Bill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gosh Darn the Kaiser","type":"Alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Mason","original_name":"Shirley Mason","popularity":0.366,"profile_path":"/mtz8dvcq9n2f72hsgZWDCLyExpZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Elsie Dresser","credit_id":"6905fedcc0e527063f597c71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Truex","original_name":"Ernest Truex","popularity":0.6736,"profile_path":"/8FA4y7tbIqjWpGtYRlTkh7lYy9f.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Teddy Swift","credit_id":"6905ff01ddefc508ce597bfe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Allen Sr.","original_name":"Joseph Allen Sr.","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Kaiser William the Nut","credit_id":"6905ff1ef0dff3c3572fe3d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Burke","original_name":"Joseph Burke","popularity":0.2456,"profile_path":"/2KV3eehHrskQUZJNeGOwsLvNhRB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Herr Dresser","credit_id":"6905ff343573ef1480463bd9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl De Planta","original_name":"Carl De Planta","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Prince Willie","credit_id":"6905ff57c8fbe205e946391e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2648478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry S.
