For Sour Cherry, Krispy, Hawaiian Blaze, and their teammates, the sport becomes much more than a competition. Through it, they find a space for sisterhood, resilience, acceptance, and healing. On camera, they share intimate stories not only of being uprooted and the wounds of intergenerational trauma, but also of reconnecting with their culture and of the relief of finding a community. In this powerful, feminist documentary, these women assert their right to exist on their own terms.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rising Through the Fray","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Courtney Montour","original_name":"Courtney Montour","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904bffc5bf445cfd65976e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
