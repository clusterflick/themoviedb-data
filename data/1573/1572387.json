New Yorker Vance Duncan promptly has an accident and is forced to recuperate in the home of Annice's father, the local doctor. Vance sends Annice to the telegraph station to wire his uncle, Mike Darcy, and there she meets detective Robert Cord, who informs her that Vance is a hopeless alcoholic. Uncle Mike arrives and Annice immediately falls in love with him, while Edna longs for Vance. Cord has Vance imprisoned in Dr. Dumbbell's Sanitarium for Drunkards, but Annice, masquerading as a patient, smuggles him out. They arrive home to find someone else's \"Uncle Mike\" chastising the detective for tracking down the wrong man, and the four young lovers finally are left in peace.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lnX8fypniPVS8yvO2NVTTS6Zuvi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16101,"logo_path":"/2yI4rjPZ1I7TLZ2UWvTtXifYEnw.png","name":"Metro Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gold Cure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La chasse aux maris","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"黄金療法","type":"Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Oh, Annice!","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Dana","original_name":"Viola Dana","popularity":0.7222,"profile_path":"/xkE1eRGSmOdgi4IPfgSWzRiYrEZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Annice Paisch","credit_id":"6905026e4b590bea30080c1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John McGowan","original_name":"John McGowan","popularity":0.0994,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Vance Duncan","credit_id":"6905029f272237eafe4c7d48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1477031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie MacLeod","original_name":"Elsie MacLeod","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":"/iLiXDRKMrTbEx66S8MR3NAE4yq3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Edna Lawson","credit_id":"690502c583237f8d554720ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3956945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Hall","original_name":"Howard Hall","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/eXsOMkfezKTIaOwm0tLmoKg21En.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Rodney Paisch","credit_id":"690502f6ee49d3c5c8f925f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred C.
