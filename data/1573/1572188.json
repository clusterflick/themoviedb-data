Born to a Haitian mother and an Italian-Quebecois father, the young woman raised in a white adoptive family examines the internalized and normalized racism that surrounds her. Her reflections on identity issues gradually combine with others related to maternal abandonment. Drawing on archives, testimonials, and stories of Black people, the director confronts family taboos, awkwardness, separations, and missed opportunities. A moving, introspective quest in which Nadia Louis-Desmarchais tries to piece together the puzzle of her identity and family.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recomposée","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Louis-Desmarchais","original_name":"Nadia Louis-Desmarchais","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/dqnhtsyJPYm1sNh3CWaQExeevCJ.jpg","credit_id":"6904bc6de3c847e5e44c7b38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
