Observing and feeling her way, she follows fleeting materials and processes that unfold in the moment. Plants transform into pigments, colors slowly take shape. In the process, measurable time becomes a subjective sensation that is lost in the creative flow. An invitation to explore the connection between nature, art, and inner experience in this timeless space and to trace the fleeting moments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Raum ohne Zeit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5789081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandra Coronato","original_name":"Alessandra Coronato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69061eec1369fc80002fe3b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
