The film spans 25 years and explores the intimate and collective memory of this project. First, families and the media gather to bear witness to the 1999 eclipse. Then, there’s a leap in time as politics infiltrates the filmmaker’s daily life and family interactions in the context of the country entering into negotiations. Finally, a present time unfolds like an urban symphony, where a collection of fragments of existence, captured on film, documents the aftermath. Without nostalgia or resentment, this essay attempts to animate Turkey’s past and future potential with sensitivity and detail.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soul of the Foot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2366887,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mustafa Uzuner","original_name":"Mustafa Uzuner","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904bcd0ae77451812471e7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
