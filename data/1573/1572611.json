Next we look down on Portland and Chesil Beach before visiting the lighthouse at Portland Bill. Seatown is the next stop where a woman in tweed plays with a small dog in the surf. Further on we see Lyme Regis and boats collecting day trippers. Various villages are seen before we arrive at Colyton in Devon - the film ends in views of lush countryside where we see an ancient clapper bridge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mijqdSqgy7yHaC17Tj5vCaW9Kgo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coasts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5788250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Bealing","original_name":"Frank Bealing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69058931b15b07b06ee12600","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":751,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mijqdSqgy7yHaC17Tj5vCaW9Kgo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
