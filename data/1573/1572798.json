So we walked the 600 kilometer trail from Glasgow to Cape Wrath and never could have imagined what awaited us.  Through midges and mountains, we filmed a feature film on foot across the West Highland Way and the Cape Wrath Trail — carrying our gear, without a small crew, without backup. And it was fantastic. Not always. But all of it together.  This is the full-length documentary of that journey: part film project, part physical and mental test, part ode to bonny wild Scotland.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"True North","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2523026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bart Schrijver","original_name":"Bart Schrijver","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690611e74b590bea30080fb2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2407574,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jasper Verkaart","original_name":"Jasper Verkaart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906120c4b590bea30080fb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36294021","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
