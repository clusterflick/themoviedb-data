Each everyday object and gesture becomes play materials, driving imagination and inventiveness in this filmed diary and survival guide. Between performance and cinema, the filmmaker blurs the boundaries between documentary and fiction, putting herself on stage, driven by stubbornness and vulnerability. Filmed in a closed set, this intimate short reveals the cathartic and healing power of creation, offering a joyful and touching exploration of the fragility and resilience of body and mind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'ai eu une idée évidente et j'attends qu'elle revienne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1453109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émilie Baillargeon","original_name":"Émilie Baillargeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fP3YbH4AjmuszCIJsPf09xZCq7g.jpg","credit_id":"6904be0c72412fcfbbf923de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
