Set in a deceptively peaceful retirement village, this darkly comic drama follows sharp-tonged, fiercely independent Cynthia as she’s reluctantly moved in by her daughter. Cynthia clashes with eccentric residents, oppressive rules, and the surprise reappearance of her old rockstar fling from the 1970s. What begins as a mission to get kicked out becomes something more complicated, as she’s forced to confront long-buried secrets, strained family ties, and the unexpected possibility of starting over. It’s a story about second chances, unlikely friendships, and how the messy, defiant reality that life – and love – don’t end with retirement.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Never Too Late","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Play For Today: Never Too Late","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Dobson","original_name":"Anita Dobson","popularity":1.5534,"profile_path":"/nhx0mjdEIFVzMkgm7VmsTvtme3U.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cynthia","credit_id":"6904ad2d2a026682154631e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Havers","original_name":"Nigel Havers","popularity":1.2764,"profile_path":"/75jjShxtJnsvWu4QwiYPjNPQjsf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"6904ad38ab36f4db7d0809bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1219469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy-Ann Oberman","original_name":"Tracy-Ann Oberman","popularity":0.8237,"profile_path":"/v1Rw6nfWYA9QaIjfLaVJTBdj2id.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Amanda","credit_id":"6904ad4db15b07b06ee12163","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Wadia","original_name":"Nina Wadia","popularity":2.0419,"profile_path":"/93UyOjCRBdVj2VwNp0JsNXlqLJU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Heather","credit_id":"6904ad5fda18a21add463235","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fenton Stevens","original_name":"Michael Fenton Stevens","popularity":0.3289,"profile_path":"/cve1ocYQwYUJwtkVZN2qBHz83Y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"6904ad7d47270eb824471dee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Williams","original_name":"Natasha Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"6904ada0da18a21add463240","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Harrak","original_name":"Sarah Harrak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904acf98e1886bca0463205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786540,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Warne","original_name":"Simon Warne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904ad0a4559f6b5944631f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099802,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lydia Marchant","original_name":"Lydia Marchant","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904ad15ab36f4db7d0809b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
