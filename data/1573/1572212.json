Between reconstruction and digital composition, she retraces the island's landmarks and reflects on her relationship with her father against a backdrop of camouflage and military presence. A video diary emerges through these journeys, linking intergenerational memory, historical past, and anecdotes. Punctuated by a certain irony, don't be afraid let it show (true colors) captures the digital aesthetic, that of the poor image, to critically articulate a gesture of reconstruction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't be afraid let it show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2257354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erica Sheu","original_name":"Erica Sheu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/k6iGUkzTrLEXFXFGbPh0jgDz9Wb.jpg","credit_id":"6904c100d56b6840da463273","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
