That all changes in an instant when they win fourteen million pounds in the lottery. Arthur dreams of spending big, finally tasting the high life. But before the celebrations can begin, Edith drops a bombshell: she wants a divorce. Big Winners is about opportunity, who gets to seize the day and who gets left behind. A thrilling, funny, deeply emotional exploration of lives lived, and lives missed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Big Winners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Play For Today: Big Winners","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Johnston","original_name":"Sue Johnston","popularity":2.1768,"profile_path":"/aXMjpy2SyhkRI27SUgDqd3MppgD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Edith Thistle","credit_id":"6904af1690f33837624c7a8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Copley","original_name":"Paul Copley","popularity":1.2458,"profile_path":"/6iKI03PIqdooId5Hal6Nn0ccVTU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Arthur Thistle","credit_id":"6904af20b15b07b06ee1218e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexa Davies","original_name":"Alexa Davies","popularity":0.7163,"profile_path":"/yVLmGoSHTJJhCNt5Puye4hQERdj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jayde","credit_id":"6904af43d2914ed67bdd78db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Tormey","original_name":"Mia Tormey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kaylee","credit_id":"6904af505bf445cfd6597689","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Turner","original_name":"Emma Turner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904af7518cfd0ed9a471ecd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3888813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Watson Allpress","original_name":"Martha Watson Allpress","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904af81f377f3ef00471eaf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
