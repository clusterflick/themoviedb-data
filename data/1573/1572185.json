Manuel Mathieu, a Haitian contemporary artist on the rise, unfolds his abstract public artworks shaped by major upheavals. In the intimacy of their exchanges, the gaze of his protégé, artist Malcom Odd, is reshaped and transformed, redefining the metropolis and its iconic mountain. Together, they invite us to explore a living space of memory, encounter, and fractures, where each gesture and each trace resonates between past and future, and where the strength of the whole arises from the richness of its fragments.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memorial Continuum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3494182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Odd","original_name":"Malcolm Odd","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904bb1edfda88e6122fdd8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
