United once more, they enjoy the time together, reminiscing about past adventures and talking about their current jobs, love lives, problems, and dreams. In the process, painful memories resurface, and injuries, wounds, and scars become visible. Over several years, Elsa Deshors films the meetings with her friends - a film like a road trip that shows us how difficult it is to be a female read person, and how friendship, mutual understanding, and support help us to come to terms with the past and find a way towards the future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Thrilling Ones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Deshors","original_name":"Elsa Deshors","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69062b49272237eafe4c8283","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Deshors","original_name":"Elsa Deshors","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69062b4f5efa647846463909","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Deshors","original_name":"Elsa Deshors","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69062b57438df80039f9285b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
