In this multigenerational, interdependent community, each individual contributes in their own way to growing or raising almost all their food and, more broadly, to creating their own shared space and way of life. They seek to live in harmony with plants and animals, adopting an approach based on respect and recognition for their ecosystem. Images and sound express this vision, often placing humans in relation to their environment. The flexible frame also highlights manual labour with its sometimes delicate, sometimes laborious gestures. This visually stunning work was filmed over two years and follows the seasons. It’s punctuated by cycles—from sowing to harvesting and from birth to slaughter—developing an inspiring reflection on society, nature, and life through ellipsis and fluidity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Tams","original_name":"Morgan Tams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904bbf1f0dff3c3572fde31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
