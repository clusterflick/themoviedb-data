Lenny Bray was once a national treasure - now he’s just a man in a mansion, hiding from headlines and haunted by whispers. But when a young man shows up at his door late one night—barefoot, bleeding, and carrying a story Lenny hoped was buried—everything unravels. Across one harrowing night, Lenny and his wife Maggie must confront a stranger’s explosive accusations—and their own complicity in a past steeped in power, silence, and manipulation. Darkly comic and emotionally raw, this is a story about guilt, truth, and what happens when survivors come knocking.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Intruder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Play For Today: Intruder","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Davies","original_name":"Alan Davies","popularity":0.9153,"profile_path":"/5eiXSaR1vW6mDYSr2Jcyf5h1xvg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lenny Bray","credit_id":"6904b0114d4d7dc9aa5976bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki Amuka-Bird","original_name":"Nikki Amuka-Bird","popularity":0.8989,"profile_path":"/tRXvwTrX4ueKXkk5jxBoHoiUSxC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maggie Bray","credit_id":"6904b026dfda88e6122fdd5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan Mersh","original_name":"Logan Mersh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"6904b0343ca5ae591be1218b","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
