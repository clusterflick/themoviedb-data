The film examines this question using the example of the peace statues for the \"comfort women\" of World War II—victims of human trafficking—which are to be removed from public spaces. It is a rarely told story of decades of revisionism and worldwide resistance. The victims were mostly poor women and girls whose stories were long ignored. Can denial and erasure completely wipe out the past? Will the truth remain hidden forever, or will it be replaced by an idealized past?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Revision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5789270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armin Mell","original_name":"Armin Mell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69062fe508f8da6b684c80b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5789272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samaré Gozal","original_name":"Samaré Gozal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69062ff0974ad7a5e5081217","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
