The two artists focus their attention on the fringes of the sporting events to provide a fresh perspective by looking primarily at the audience, behind-the-scenes activities, and parallel events. This short film offers a surprisingly poetic and political reflection, guided by a captivating narration that oscillates between an accumulation of precise information and a fascinating interpretation of this gathering and, more broadly, of our era. With a refined touch of humour and bite, this short film builds an allegory that is sociological, artistic, and critical, subtly exploring multiple reflections on the place of technology, the very idea of competition or the inequalities of this “world where the future turns” in the blind spot of this global gathering.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeux de Correspondance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2121765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Popa","original_name":"Dan Popa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904be5ac8a944f280f92352","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5786642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hoda Adra","original_name":"Hoda Adra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6904be6c410d559b8a4c7aac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
