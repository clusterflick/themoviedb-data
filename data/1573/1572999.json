This time, his focus is on the presence of human beings on the move in films. With meticulousness, poetry, and symbolism, this work arranges this similar yet heterogeneous material to form a kind of relay race through eras, countries, and environments. In this way, these individual movements follow one another, respond to one another, or merge, tracing the complex trajectory of an imagined community travelling through a dreamlike, timeless memory. A solitary means of transport and a leisurely stroll, walking is also a vehicle for a common affirmation, collective action, solidarity, and even popular uprising.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marche commune","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","original_name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/9GHnEYPzSjWgohVRsbwEOSaLjGy.jpg","credit_id":"690676772016221e4a2fe71a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
