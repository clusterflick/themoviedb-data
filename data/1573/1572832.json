Sparingly lit by their helmet lamps, they blend in with the sediment-covered cave walls. The film accompanies a group of cave explorers and looks at their different motives for venturing into the inaccessible depths. In the farthest corners of the \"Windloch\" cave, discovered in 2019, lies a chamber filled with bizarre, delicate aragonite crystals. The most extraordinary of these is called \"Hydra\" by its discoverers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Hydra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3218147,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobias Berghaus","original_name":"Tobias Berghaus","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6906238cfa3095ecd14c810d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
