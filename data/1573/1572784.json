Their work is directed against right-wing ideologies, social brutalization, and the normalization of authoritarian thinking, and is satirical, radical, and anarchic. The film accompanies the twins for three days around the federal elections in February 2025—a moment when political alliances between the CDU and AfD provoke public outrage and protests across the country. A portrait of two artists whose view of the world is rebellious yet permeable to contradictions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Igitte Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5788909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marvin Krause","original_name":"Marvin Krause","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69060b7f2697d30c0a2fe3f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2025-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
