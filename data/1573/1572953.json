The Bob animation tests were created on Alias computer systems. The Megabyte/Hacker segment is from an even earlier animation test created on the same FGS system used to create Money For Nothing.  This footage was transferred from D1 video tape (originally recorded from VHS) and restored by the ReBoot ReWind crew: Jacob Weldon, Raquel Lin, Mark Westhaver & Bryan Baker.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mE16GKs7ym9a04hGnS9b21AdC1C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":279121,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Hub","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"I love to rumble, and I hate to fumble\" - MegaByte","title":"ReBoot 1990 Limelight Demo Reel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"REEBOOT!","type":"Original Name"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Pearson","original_name":"Ian Pearson","popularity":0.2561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69065e74fb87192302e127f4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183873,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gavin Blair","original_name":"Gavin Blair","popularity":0.3047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69065e824f17566a552fe6bc","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183874,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philip Mitchell","original_name":"Philip Mitchell","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69065e8ed466743a1ce1272a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183873,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gavin Blair","original_name":"Gavin Blair","popularity":0.3047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690660954f17566a552fe6ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Pearson","original_name":"Ian Pearson","popularity":0.2561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690660a2ae7745181247252a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183874,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philip Mitchell","original_name":"Philip Mitchell","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690660b2b403221bea2fe3e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k7TkXf1bKO69so7GiSMOPT5WCn9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mE16GKs7ym9a04hGnS9b21AdC1C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14544,"name":"robot"},{"id":161184,"name":"reboot"},{"id":185861,"name":"glitch"},{"id":278823,"name":"3d animation"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"},{"id":310266,"name":"computer world"},{"id":339152,"name":"early cgi"},{"id":360047,"name":"cgi"},{"id":361340,"name":"test animation"},{"id":361341,"name":"demo reel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ReBoot - 1990 Limelight Demo Reel","key":"JjPJO8SRzFM","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-26T15:00:16.000Z","id":"69065f0a08f8e422f9081069"}]}}}
