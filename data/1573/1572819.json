The film collage reflects on the medicalization of mental suffering and the loneliness that lies in synthetic calm. Through chaotic layers of media, it shows how the self is not healed, but rather rendered illegible and suspended in a borderline state between sedation and despair.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"1g Quetiapine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3662498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siyan Liu","original_name":"Siyan Liu","popularity":0.1533,"profile_path":"/rJKo7Df38JHI8HC3nIfsqqxr8B7.jpg","credit_id":"69061db7f5c0a7b3f6463704","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
