Each drink offers solace and torment, pulling him deeper into an abyss where memory and reality dissolve like smoke. He navigates dimly lit streets and alleys of his psyche.  In this audacious short film, two visionary female directors make their debut within the New Zealand short film scene. They craft a kaleidoscopic tapestry of dadaist elements, challenging narrative coherence and inviting viewers to confront life's absurdities. This cinematic odyssey explores familial ties, unresolved trauma, and the quest for redemption, illuminating the shadows tethering us to our pasts while heralding a powerful voice in contemporary storytelling.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":25000,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Haunted by the past, lost in the present: a surreal descent into the shadows of guilt and memory.\"","title":"MOTHER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Rice","original_name":"Jessica Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"66d531ee93615794d3301b5c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Rice","original_name":"Jessica Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Young Boy","credit_id":"66d5321d48d3aa50009bdc35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Rice","original_name":"Jessica Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Homeless Man","credit_id":"66d5322d9dc73a87a2b0bc9a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Rice","original_name":"Jessica Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d531e2050849fd30020892","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
