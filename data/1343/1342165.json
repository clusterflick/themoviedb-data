Some of the greatest advances in aviation technology emanated from its laboratories and workshops, and working alongside the scientists were expert photographers who filmed many of their extraordinary experiments. This historic footage has been preserved by the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust and features in this first of a series of A to Z guides of the many successful and ground breaking developments - as well as the not so successful trials and tribulation that took place at the Establishment. The program includes some unusual and previously unreleased footage plus a rare interview with the famous former test pilot, Neville Duke.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6gq7UjQ1Wsw4dpM7QxmBc8poRVA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flashback Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The A to Z of British Military Aviation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neville Duke","original_name":"Neville Duke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d521678f265bb6e9b63e86","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917955,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Brent Miller","original_name":"Brent Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d52083d94dffd8f7020305","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492538,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Morgan","original_name":"Ashley Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d54954b5f28ae9eaa6d26c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492538,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Morgan","original_name":"Ashley Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5496319a3aa3458b1adcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Webb","original_name":"Colin Webb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d549e673989e99a0948e37","department":"Writing","job":"Script Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2820,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6gq7UjQ1Wsw4dpM7QxmBc8poRVA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
