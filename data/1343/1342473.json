To do so, Pedro enlists the help of old colleagues from the Santa Fe Jazz Ensamble, a big band founded in the early 80s. Along the way, he interacts with friends, students and alumni, trying to assemble the different generations as important pieces of the film project.  Life stories, memories, performances, anecdotes, clinics and of course the music, are addressed in the documentary around the making of the film.","popularity":0.1341,"poster_path":"/cipidBXMyvuYOL5JHLDoiAPXPQT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Proyecto
