Despite the relevance and artistic value of his works, he is not included in the white art scene. This documentaryconfronts viewers with the volatility of life, when Felix suffers a stroke. Next, something surprising happens: As a result of a changing social awareness, young creatives of colour look back and realise on whose shoulders they are standing. And there is a retrospective of De Rooyâ€™s work at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. Suddenly, Felix gets the acknowledgement he deserves.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/uCppgXO0BzFB91dz9LiSYVlJxEF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nomade in Niemandsland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix de Rooy","original_name":"Felix de Rooy","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/2uCo6xK4MztA3kmAtDgFUKNUnm1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d5d5c0261a80a77f182a13","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hester Jonkhout","original_name":"Hester Jonkhout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5d565011b3c924a275ff4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hester Jonkhout","original_name":"Hester Jonkhout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5d5707f05f3fac5a6d840","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willem Baptist","original_name":"Willem Baptist","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5d581a79ddc5fac45b3b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385785,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nienke Korthof","original_name":"Nienke Korthof","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5d596828b7e13403026ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32149822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xEolaKpjAS0TR1m4Y4nwXdj0hfp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/uCppgXO0BzFB91dz9LiSYVlJxEF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Curacao International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nederlands Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
