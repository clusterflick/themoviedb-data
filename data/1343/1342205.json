The Chinese students laugh as the Lahu girls who finish last in races and on tests. One girl falls ill, and is sent home; another finds out her mother has run away. The girls' teacher feels frustrated and hopeless; the school principal wishes he had never admitted them. Can the Lahu girls make it in modern-day China? And what price will they have to pay? Do Chinese schools empower or assimilate China's minority children? \"Children of Blessing\" takes a controversial stance on this ever sensitive question.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of Blessing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"江学勤","original_name":"江学勤","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d55017d9ada2cde64ce5cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
