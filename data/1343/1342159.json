The video traces the history and the path of much of the original 1913 route across 14 states, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, by way of a road trip in a somewhat-restored 1978 Ford Thunderbird. Instead of a vlog or a documentary, it is written and produced as an old-school travelogue, which incorporates both opinion and nonfiction into one unified narrative. It is not meant to be viewed in one sitting-- like a nonfiction book, you can pick it up or put it down at your leisure and also browse by chapter. However, like the Lincoln Highway, I wanted it to be a continuous experience from coast to coast, illustrating the landscape and its history all the way from the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, to 42nd and Broadway in New York City, and beyond.","popularity":0.0815,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":451,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lincoln Highway: Across America on the First Transcontinental Motor Route","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3375486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","original_name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d518ff5ca9e1cd254cdbc1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3375486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","original_name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d51a32402317d61acb6821","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3375486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","original_name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d51b15a658ab22ebb63dfc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3375486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","original_name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d51b4166ee96854dc1070c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3375486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","original_name":"Noah Caldwell-Gervais","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d51b4a9d9f9e9ac07e2922","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tqhbejLVzvsk2Rfuk1C0TFcBshI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Lincoln Highway: Across America on the First Transcontinental Motor Route","key":"SmFQR0IltDQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-02T16:54:01.000Z","id":"66d51a5493615794d3301532"}]}}}
