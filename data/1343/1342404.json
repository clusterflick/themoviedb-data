Huang Rui, Ma Desheng, and Wang Keping were key figures in the collective. The film begins with the group’s 1979 exhibition outside the National Art Museum of China in Beijing and records its closure by the authorities, the street demonstrations to protest the closure, negotiations with the authorities, and the subsequent exhibition at Beihai Park. The work is the only known video that records these significant moments, and it also offers insight into life in Beijing after the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). Held at M+ Museum in Hong Kong.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fnq3Ed1rTHKa47UojR59w3g4GxH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film of Stars Group Activities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"星星美展掠影‎","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chi Xiaoning","original_name":"Chi Xiaoning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5bb789c623701996edd33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chi Xiaoning","original_name":"Chi Xiaoning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b426651d26ba93c78b15d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5091286,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ren Shulin","original_name":"Ren Shulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b42750a70f2ad44990381","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fnq3Ed1rTHKa47UojR59w3g4GxH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1979-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
