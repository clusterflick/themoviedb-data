The next time Leon shuffles off to Buffalo, Dorothy follows on the same airplane disguised as a beautiful-but-poor widow from the south. Dorothy, in disguise, quickly gets more of Leon's attention on the plane than she ever got at home. The plane is grounded short of Buffalo, and the ever-gallant Leon steps up to take care of the poor widow's hotel bill, but has to register her as his wife in order to do so. Dorothy reveals who she is, but Leon wiggles out of the situation in his usual wormy fashion.","popularity":0.1036,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Cheat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Errol","original_name":"Leon Errol","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/8jV6d5rKmmXn69TRbm4Ndehdrpr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leon Errol","credit_id":"60f60dafc7a7e0004779cf5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Granger","original_name":"Dorothy Granger","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/3iNHKiEQ0wx2bTYMzG2YdRz28HK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Dorothy Errol","credit_id":"60f60dc38258fc007396f883","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Yates","original_name":"Hal Yates","popularity":0.1723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f60d77b84cdd002f61c81e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0232746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
