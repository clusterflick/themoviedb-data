Vulnerable and especially needy children get the opportunity to come to the Christmas brand homes around Denmark. Not all children have it just as easy at home, the funds can be small and they can be very much left to themselves. Child life in the backyards is a condition for many. Many children need good care and fresh air after illness. The lucky ones will stay at a Christmas brand home. However, it can be difficult to say goodbye at Central Station. We follow the daily life at Lindersvold in Faxe, which has 80 children all year round, Fjordmark by Flensburg Fjord, Holbølls Minde by Svendborg, which has 60 smaller children, the Hobro home by Mariager Fjord, which is the newest and most modern, and the Christmas brand home in Juelsminde . The royal couple visit Hobro Christmas brand home.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26274,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dansk Film Co.","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1949-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julemærkefilmen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dronning Ingrid","original_name":"Dronning Ingrid","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60f63de6af58cb002f3c31ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3152619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Frederik IX of Denmark","original_name":"Frederik IX","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60f63def42d8a50045feb3c4","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10055356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"1949-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
