This film was made during an artists' residency I had there in March 2010.  The title is taken from the book \"A Pattern Language: Towns-Buildings-Construction\" by Christopher Alexander. This book is the second in a trilogy that sets forth a structured architectural philosophy of self-designed environments.  This piece was shot on 16mm film using colored filters and single-frame exposures. The color was not manipulated in the digital edit. Each color corresponds to one of 5 notes in the Romanian B Minor scale.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sf5OqcueE4PcEJC9amUwZCYORZD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Pattern Language","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3166512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tara Merenda Nelson","original_name":"Tara Merenda Nelson","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/audaebEVAz3GHWPfQSlRyu8ao6F.jpg","credit_id":"60f86e25209f18002b72297e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sf5OqcueE4PcEJC9amUwZCYORZD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
