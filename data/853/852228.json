It is through their humour and dignity that these ageing birds demonstrate their resilience and provoke us to pick up the phone and get in touch with the elderly people in our lives.  The film is a collaboration between public health scholars and filmmakers in New Zealand.","popularity":0.259,"poster_path":"/nsJtcOFeVjnwtLRujcNLZICQzzt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nomadz
