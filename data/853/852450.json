Tom Jones's 1950s in Pontypridd are told first hand by the man himself as he travels back to his birthplace.  Tom's take on the decade is amplified and explored by a Greek chorus of contributors who share their account of their 50s. Joan Bakewell, Katherine Whitehorn and Michele Hanson share their experiences both as women and from differing class backgrounds, historians Alwyn Turner, Martin Johnes, Francis Beckett and Tony Russell draw the social and political landscape of a rapidly changing decade, while musicians Bruce Welch, Clem Cattini, Marty Wilde and Tom McGuinness talk of how that decade began their musical journeys and changed their lives forever, all illustrated by a rich seam of archive that captures a decade we mostly saw in black and white.","popularity":0.4258,"poster_path":"/4L6opZVHTlrFdffuWIDZT3we7SD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a personal journey through his formative years in south Wales in the 1950s, Tom Jones takes us on a trip through the decade of his childhood and adolescence.","title":"Tom Jones's 1950s: The Decade That Made Me","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Jones","original_name":"Tom Jones","popularity":0.7151,"profile_path":"/A88iOPpDT6In8tWvl9LWyxLPHzR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"presenter","credit_id":"60f6f3c17b7b4d00455c5dcc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Rodley","original_name":"Chris Rodley","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/68s5Da7VJ8vcoUG3b4WWyq1jRDP.jpg","credit_id":"60f6f3eb3103250046cb2d70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cooper","original_name":"Mark Cooper","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/l5xmotx7X1JVUQgwmgU60pnIOPB.jpg","credit_id":"60f6f406fd140b005d299611","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Rodley","original_name":"Chris Rodley","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/68s5Da7VJ8vcoUG3b4WWyq1jRDP.jpg","credit_id":"60f6f3f77b7b4d0020edacac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4L6opZVHTlrFdffuWIDZT3we7SD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2016-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
