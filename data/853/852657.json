Using images from films he made in the past, the Hungarian tells about his experiences as a resistance fighter, refugee and bohemian. The documentary maker is fascinated by Mykosch's story but finds it increasingly difficult to distinguish between film and reality. The Hungarian lies without batting an eyelid, tells real and fake stories with the same charm and builds up theories, only to ridicule them. In the editing room, Mykosch finishes his latest film. He can't decide when to let the protagonist die. Then the documentary maker realizes that the death of the character will also mean the end of Mykosch.","popularity":0.1414,"poster_path":"/84r8WiWJwmbN8szCaIDl1AXDwp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":259254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stichting Toekomst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mykosch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Carlos Tajes","original_name":"Juan Carlos Tajes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60f7eadd944a570075d70e79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roef Ragas","original_name":"Roef Ragas","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/n6P05tPmj2pb4vVmPfGPxmAQENG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60f7eae53103250072a76caa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meral Taygun","original_name":"Meral Taygun","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/sfASePxxazRoTc4I6MiuxO1z45B.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60f7eaedfd140b005d2b7cd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Cavadino","original_name":"Anne Cavadino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67fad7c87b43bdce20aee09b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007663,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danniel Danniel","original_name":"Danniel Danniel","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/wPJAy83HUfX3xSm8wbxods2L1tq.jpg","credit_id":"60f7eafb9603310047235108","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6766,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Els Vandevorst","original_name":"Els Vandevorst","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/3NqnKX3Rn5RNJ5RiAC0KZkePlmo.jpg","credit_id":"67fad7eca04f530b5c996a59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007663,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danniel Danniel","original_name":"Danniel Danniel","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/wPJAy83HUfX3xSm8wbxods2L1tq.jpg","credit_id":"67fad8011f3bcfea48d959ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3717568,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maarten Kramer","original_name":"Maarten Kramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fad816d4c444a1cc9a232d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368411,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Michal Shabtay","original_name":"Michal Shabtay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fad8287b43bdce20aee0b1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289914,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jessica de Koning","original_name":"Jessica de Koning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fad83fde5e4dec62add284","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/84r8WiWJwmbN8szCaIDl1AXDwp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
