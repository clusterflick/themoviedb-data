This recording of Anthony Dowell's 1994 production for The Royal Ballet, with designs by Maria Björnson, features an outstanding cast led by Viviana Durante as a radiant Princess Aurora. She is partnered by Zoltán Solymosi as Prince Florimund and Anthony Dowell himself is a glitteringly elegant embodiment of evil as the wicked fairy Carabosse. The Royal Ballet, exceptional as ever, is accompanied by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, deftly conducted by Barry Wordsworth.","popularity":0.0951,"poster_path":"/629GaHcZIbnMH1qrrD4GitJzOH2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sleeping Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2830163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viviana Durante","original_name":"Viviana Durante","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Princess Aurora","credit_id":"60f8c75f85da1200627f60dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2830164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoltan Solymosi","original_name":"Zoltan Solymosi","popularity":0.1867,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Prince Florimund","credit_id":"60f8c7706e3deb002de69a73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Dowell","original_name":"Anthony Dowell","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carabosse","credit_id":"60f8c77cf1759c00766048ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2830165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benazir Hussain","original_name":"Benazir Hussain","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Lilac Fairy","credit_id":"60f8c907f056d5004761731a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2788808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Tuckett","original_name":"William Tuckett","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/qqHB1wFcUGnKEHZqIaGPgVLSULS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"King Florestan","credit_id":"60f8c79d6e3deb007ebeb662","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth McGorian","original_name":"Elizabeth McGorian","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/kWAsQgkFIAJZc7FDehk2CsHECvL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Queen","credit_id":"60f8c7aefd140b0029397a90","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Dowell","original_name":"Anthony Dowell","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f8c87c11386c00451d7828","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166844,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barry Wordsworth","original_name":"Barry Wordsworth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f8c812fd140b00463c80bc","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166847,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Pat Collins","original_name":"Pat Collins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f8c8b6e039f1005e1e954d","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166846,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fyodor Lopokov","original_name":"Fyodor Lopokov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f8c8653103250072a91cde","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Пётр Чайковский","popularity":0.3088,"profile_path":"/zTnrtuLddN6KYU3gVVepEiAsgek.jpg","credit_id":"60f8c805960331004724f997","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasko Vassilev","original_name":"Vasko Vassilev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f8c8e2f056d5005e6fd381","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2229903,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kenneth MacMillan","original_name":"Kenneth MacMillan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rVku2uKEJez9azNjM7EezifczHU.jpg","credit_id":"60f8c8456e3deb005ccef05d","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166845,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marius Pepita","original_name":"Marius Pepita","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f8c824d7fbda0079f128bb","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138993,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Frederick Ashton","original_name":"Frederick Ashton","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/1Wp3xOsDSd3Y9V5UraCSbgOXUbX.jpg","credit_id":"60f8c838f1759c0046670f1c","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0323993","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":854,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/629GaHcZIbnMH1qrrD4GitJzOH2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":604}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
