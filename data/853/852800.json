Her Instagram post led, in November last year, to the artist and his long-awaited debut album being cancelled by his record label, Black Butter, part of Sony Music. Tamanna explores why Hana felt she had to go public with her allegations.  Questions are also asked about the relationship between Island Records, a subsidiary of Universal, and one of music’s most dangerous men, Solo 45. Today the grime star is in jail for 30 years for raping and torturing women. But before Island handed him a deal, he served six months in prison in Cyprus for domestic violence.
