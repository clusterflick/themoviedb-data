It is arguably Britain’s most famous export. The man often given credit for the global triumph of English, and the invention of many of our modern words, is William Shakespeare.  Shakespeare’s plays first hit the stage four centuries ago, as the explorers of Elizabethan England were laying the foundations for the British empire. It was this empire that would carry English around the world. Language historian and BBC New Generation Thinker Dr John Gallagher asks whether the real story of how English became a global linguistic superpower is more complex.","popularity":0.0609,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shakespeare is often credited with revolutionising English, but is the real story more complex?","title":"Scuffles, Swagger and Shakespeare: The Hidden Story of English","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3165603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Culpeper","original_name":"Jonathan Culpeper","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Interviewed Guest","credit_id":"60f74163fd140b0029368341","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3165605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Horobin","original_name":"Simon Horobin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Interviewed Guest","credit_id":"60f741727b7b4d007358417f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3165606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farah Karim-Cooper","original_name":"Farah Karim-Cooper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Interviewed Guest","credit_id":"60f7417f9603310047220521","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3165607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cathy Shrank","original_name":"Cathy Shrank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Interviewed Guest","credit_id":"60f74194f1759c004664177f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3165610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gallagher","original_name":"John Gallagher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"60f741e139a1a60082fd93be","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743439,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Parkins","original_name":"Emma Parkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f74100fd140b0029368268","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374650,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Nikkel","original_name":"Chris Nikkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f740eae72fe8005e3c4b6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":955475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ed Stobart","original_name":"Ed Stobart","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/uDTWpMZdHokwQzQNNuoVqilsa2d.jpg","credit_id":"60f74119f1759c00765d610a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
