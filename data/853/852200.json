Their unending work mopping, cutting, cleaning, folding, cooking, sorting, and calculating highlights the overlap of first, second, and third shifts for women, and situates the diffuse transformation of proletariat into precariat at the level of daily life. One of the key works by journalist and engaged documentarian Marcel Trillat. Although he passed away in 2020, his kindness, warmth, and generosity will not be forgotten.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1YSbN08cSKBBe5u8weGdYt1Muh5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95490,"logo_path":null,"name":"VLR Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Precariat Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164139,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Dehaut","original_name":"Catherine Dehaut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f6005be72fe80046d8dd73","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164137,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Suzanne Durand","original_name":"Suzanne Durand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f6004b7b7b4d005c499281","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Trillat","original_name":"Marcel Trillat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f5fff2af58cb0046cd531b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164136,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Julien Trillat","original_name":"Julien Trillat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f6003d42d8a50045fe1ef8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1YSbN08cSKBBe5u8weGdYt1Muh5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
