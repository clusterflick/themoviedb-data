By this time in the sport the age of “freeriding” had fully caught fire, and glipses of the early days of FMX competition can be seen throughout. Mix that together with the classic spread of Terrafirma goods from epic 1998 Outdoor National coverage, freeriding with Ryan Hughes & Jeff Emig at Castillo Ranch, Canadian off-road mad men Guy Perrett & Ian Pavluk, the FMX antics of the late Mike Cinqmars & Mike Metzger and pro snowboarders Mike “Tex” Devenport & Jim Rippey trading in their boards for dirtbikes in the summer. And don’t miss the inaugural US Open of Supercross towards the end.
