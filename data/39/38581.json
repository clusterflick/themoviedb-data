The site he chose for his state-of-the-art factory was on the outskirts of Belfast, a city best-known for sectarian violence and high levels of unemployment. The unexpected marriage of high-tech glamour with the gritty reality of 1970s Northern Ireland captured the public's imagination but this early optimism would end in failure. Although the cars looked great, the windows leaked and the engines seized; as his financial problems mounted the maverick DeLorean faced charges of drugs trafficking. Adrian Dunbar narrates the story.","popularity":0.7846,"poster_path":"/a55kTH3CeTJIWJt2CMFOkzPJWtP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Car Crash: The Delorean Story","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1910214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Crane","original_name":"George Crane","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59ecd5c0c3a36871bc009f9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Z.
