The second segment is about an ordinary man named Albert Einstein (\"the only Albert Einstein not to have discovered the Theory of Relativity\") whose hands have a life of their own, staying out late at night, misbehaving and committing adultery with feet. The third segment â€“ hasn't much story to it at all, and instead concerns the inhabitants of the moving pictures on an over-sized Christmas card, who interact with each other in all sorts of bizarre ways.","popularity":0.3919,"poster_path":"/u7jxcwi6Ld1RIR9YTIF1iCZN3jg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1979-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storytime","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Gilliam","original_name":"Terry Gilliam","popularity":0.7405,"profile_path":"/7qBkaXxANmnb6hqQCBc4iWqXEL6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"629cb97aa284eb00509ce8b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Gilliam","original_name":"Terry Gilliam","popularity":0.7405,"profile_path":"/7qBkaXxANmnb6hqQCBc4iWqXEL6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46e59251416c9106369f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Gilliam","original_name":"Terry Gilliam","popularity":0.7405,"profile_path":"/7qBkaXxANmnb6hqQCBc4iWqXEL6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46e59251416c910636a5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0352875","wikidata_id":"Q638930","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iCdOVN5DcCSpZ6OOATclM8VaV3a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1374}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u7jxcwi6Ld1RIR9YTIF1iCZN3jg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Terry Gilliam - Storytime (1968)","key":"_6DrxyfBboE","published_at":"2012-01-10T13:10:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"5408521dc3a368582c000dfe"}]}}}
