Ever year rivals Avtar Singh (Sharat Saxena) and Jiten Singh (Om Puri) try to beat each other in the wrestling match and gain the trusteeship of the village. Rama (Rajpal Yadav) plays the role of a village simpleton and a post-master. It filled with misunderstandings and misconceptions, of hidden identities and secret love-affairs and the outcome is simply hilarious. The movie begins to take a turn when a certain someone delivers a secret package in the wrong hands. Especially someone, who is bound to take advantage and manipulate the real owner of the package.","popularity":0.5862,"poster_path":"/mT9UR5tifEYX0Z08RPJGczBy7jV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kushti","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajpal Yadav","original_name":"राजपाल यादव","popularity":1.679,"profile_path":"/zhzfI91YuODuC3ZY2ABytw68C37.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chander","credit_id":"52fe46a39251416c9105acd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nargis Bagheri","original_name":"Nargis Bagheri","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/A1QSZ7RIZdA8Fno6zbt4vFgaiEJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Laadli","credit_id":"52fe46a39251416c9105acdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalip Singh","original_name":"Dalip Singh","popularity":0.5495,"profile_path":"/schkY03JHXA5CClyfKuptnvhuLm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"576d8d4bc3a36856c4000a87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Om Puri","original_name":"Om Puri","popularity":0.4953,"profile_path":"/npVcDkdHSROXbMPUr45MGBJFQus.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"576d93df9251412b87000108","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharat Saxena","original_name":"Sharat Saxena","popularity":0.519,"profile_path":"/ArW6nQ23bjVfbcFmNVl4W9zpd7X.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"576d94039251412c060000f5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Govardhan Asrani","original_name":"Govardhan Asrani","popularity":0.4893,"profile_path":"/zoZRnIHNkCRq4gKZGaQhbtPrIDj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"576d9410c3a36802c7000146","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asif Basra","original_name":"Asif Basra","popularity":0.3009,"profile_path":"/dHxkTrfEnreC77vRS0SVtaebDQI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"576d9441c3a368027a000149","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Razak Khan","original_name":"Razak Khan","popularity":0.1195,"profile_path":"/cyfZyIApQK0eOrOeoyTgAl0U3EQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"576d9618c3a36874e4002e8b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jagadish","original_name":"Jagadish","popularity":1.8239,"profile_path":"/ml3XX5bWPIdHUPvqhW2MYYZ8H7Y.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Puncher Pappu","credit_id":"5be92f8b0e0a263c060398dc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manoj Joshi","original_name":"Manoj Joshi","popularity":0.3975,"profile_path":"/u7GllU8dO2bkAvRC0i8yszogYqY.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"601e70949d2b63003e208d76","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramesh Pisharody","original_name":"Ramesh Pisharody","popularity":0.3858,"profile_path":"/iGhteyL6Eii6f8qBfb47ygnUb7L.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"601e70ca12197e003c3e8d12","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"T.
