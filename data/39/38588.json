Julius falls and is nearly eaten by crocodiles but manages to escape nevertheless. Meanwhile, two elephant children are having fun at a watering hole and a monkey barber has his barber pole eaten by a hippo, who mistakes it for a candy cane. Julius tries to remedy the latter injustice by starching up a tiger's striped tail and knocking it off, using it as a replacement pole. Alice hunts a lion who proves to be too much for her to handle, but Julius bravely comes to the rescue.","popularity":0.2479,"poster_path":"/pJqmbjOA3Bs4HyRvtnO8jMuEaZ4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice in the Jungle","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Davis","original_name":"Virginia Davis","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":"/pwFCCPf6v4Wb4u0bNFHLGRAOmJG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"52fe46c89251416c9105f89b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46c89251416c9105f885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144555,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret J.
