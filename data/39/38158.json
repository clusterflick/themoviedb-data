Although today s computers can make calculations in one-100th of a second and technology can transport us outside the bonds of Earth, only now are we beginning to understand the most complex machine in the universe. Using simple analogies, real-life case studies, and state-of-the-art CGI, this special shows how the brain works, explains the frequent battle between instinct and reason, and unravels the mysteries of memory and decision-making. It takes us inside the mind of a soldier under fire to see how decisions are made in extreme situations, examines how an autistic person like Rain Man develops remarkable skills, and takes on the age-old question of what makes one person good and another evil. Research is rushing forward. Weâ€™ve learned more about the workings of the brain in the last five years than in the previous one hundred.","popularity":0.5186,"poster_path":"/njpxkMiwL83r9HIfYs5zhZdu7EH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2015,"logo_path":"/2QYmUQEca7nlEmFkuvKQjKQsE0m.png","name":"DSP","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brain","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1232187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Thompson","original_name":"Erik Thompson","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/7JaIU7JQvfoWCxSpx9lVbY0A3jU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"53a60aa80e0a2614490020b0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332832,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"John Peterman","original_name":"John Peterman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a60ae00e0a2614490020c1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1342983","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/njpxkMiwL83r9HIfYs5zhZdu7EH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6016,"name":"biology"},{"id":183974,"name":"anatomy"},{"id":220347,"name":"neurology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
