Ron won't let up and finds a lever to blackmail Henry, whose daughter Gina has killed a pedestrian in a hit-and-run car accident. To protect Gina, Henry disposes of Ron, but a murderous sociopath witnesses this crime. Henry and this stranger bond in an odd way, telling stories about their childhoods. Henry makes a deal with the stranger, helping to get rid of the body of one of the stranger's victims. Will this act seal a bargain between the two men and get Henry off the hook, or will the stranger threaten Henry and Gina?","popularity":0.6035,"poster_path":"/7z0vJWTPuWSt0j5njYhJf4lm5t2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
