She dances with gesture, expansion, and carves through her childhood home while recognizing the adaptive nature of the Tibetan identity across generations. As the story progresses, the camera expands on movement with match cut editing, shifting perspective, and magnifying expression. Metaphors reveal themselves and the father recalls returning to his homeland after 50 years. Dance, camera, and story merge as Home creatively unveils the Tibetan resilience by uniting both immigrant and first-generation voices.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4387449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonam Tshedzom Tingkhye","original_name":"Sonam Tshedzom Tingkhye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b4384ea84c7109402fb8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South Sound Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
