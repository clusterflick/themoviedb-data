Born in the department of Salto, she lived her childhood in the orchards of her grandparents, the Medici, where she treasured memories that later, already in Montevideo, she would translate into one of the most exquisite works of national and Latin American literature. In her lyrics, angels and demons coexist within a rural landscape, where the different elements of nature are exalted and disturbed with a unique poetic flight. She was also an extraordinary and absolutely authentic character. Her work, which has received numerous awards, has been translated into English, French, Portuguese and Italian. In The Wild Papers (with various editions) her very unique poetry is gathered.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":213887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerio de
