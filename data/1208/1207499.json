Baba luba follows him on his journey back to Brazil, his native country, 36 years after his father left him and his mother there. Since he was four years old Bassin has not heard a thing from him. When Bassin and the film crew arrive in Brazil they have very few leads concerning his father's whereabouts, they do not even know whether he is still alive. They undertake a real search, which has been captured on film with the suspense of a detective story. Bassin discovers a police file on his father and he finds out that his father has twice remarried. He meets family members of whom he never knew they even existed. Finally he meets his father. Director Julie Shles has managed to register both the exciting and dramatic episodes of the trip, as well as the moments of despair and agitation. This also makes the film a universal study of the ideas about fatherhood and family ties and the search for love that every human undertakes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5y3rplCK4HgGzQtSonOdrtEFBme.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baba Lubba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Shles","original_name":"Julie Shles","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655aa34953866e00c5b42cf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133394","wikidata_id":"Q4837344","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/5y3rplCK4HgGzQtSonOdrtEFBme.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
