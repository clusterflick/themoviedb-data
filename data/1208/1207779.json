It was the wettest and muddiest since 1977. Good news perhaps for the 4 wheel-drive armada of Subaru Legacies, piloted by rally aces Markku Alen, 'Possum' Bourne, Mike Kirkland and Jim Heather-Hayes. Carlos Sainz, Mikael Ericsson and Bjorn Waldegaard were in the Toyota Celica GT-4s and Martini Lancia had Miki Biasion, Alex Fiorio and Flying Finn Juha Kankkunen on board. The World's press arrived in force to watch what they expected would be Lancia's great Safari hat trick. What they actually saw is brilliantly recorded in this thrilling video - which you will want to watch over and over again.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hZX51dGTGCChCH3n6CCC23pndNx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safari Rally 1990","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3FdH2IavEsOrq7r12GnyqYckQti.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZX51dGTGCChCH3n6CCC23pndNx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
