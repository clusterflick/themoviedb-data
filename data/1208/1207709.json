He was already walking with a stick, but was still strong. He said to me: This land is Shuar land and the one who created this nature is a being called Arútam. When I die, you children will have to defend this land that belongs to us. These words are forever etched in my memory\" (Antonio Chiriap, regional president of the Shuar-Federation).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/RU0WOMzDbVxP4d0abJw9peub22.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmkollektiv Zürich AG","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":12997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Limbo Film AG","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shuar - Volk der heiligen Wasserfälle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Fässler","original_name":"Lisa Fässler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b379f0816c7011a0e8f19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Fässler","original_name":"Lisa Fässler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b37250816c700e01c1332","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4387412,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claudia Martini","original_name":"Claudia Martini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b37b0d4fe0400e1b5b764","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0431395","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/RU0WOMzDbVxP4d0abJw9peub22.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurn Film Festival","release_date":"1987-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
