Nissan introduced their latest supercar, the brand new Pulsar GT with Stig Blomqvist, Mike Kirkland and David Llewellin on board. The usual big-name drivers were present including Juha Kankkunen, Jorge Recalde and Miki Biasion representing Martini Lancia's main assault team. World Champion Carlos Sainz was totally unfazed by the competition nor was he unduly disturbed by Nissan's Pulsars. Sainz spearheaded Toyota's battle squad which also included Bjorn Waldegaard and the notoriously fast Miki Biasion. The stage was set for a fast and furious round. The outcome was as stunning as the fabulous scenery of Africa, captured skilfully by the ever-alert cameramen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9A9vdT2Gc17Zvlgu1bmubnDQwp2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safari Rally 1991","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sPXcgf4ux0W4AXWac937NxOtaI0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9A9vdT2Gc17Zvlgu1bmubnDQwp2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
