Superb coverage brings you this freezing season opener, in an intriguing year of World Championship rallying under the Group A ruling of the time.  Four wheel drive was the thing to have on this event.  The one official factory team present, Mazda, had entered two cars for Timo Salonen, and Ingvar Carlsson.  They received a strong challenge throughout the rally from the privately entered Lancia Delta Integrales of Per Eklund, and Mikael Ericsson, plus a host of similarly entered Toyotas, Audis, and Opels.  Sit back, and watch the Arctic Gladiators battle for supremacy on Swedenâ€™s treacherous, icy surfaces.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vnIDXktVJb3BSveXFCdKdMzeLo4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rally Sweden 1989","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/reNmQA1cf0UKn68367qnbQnXmk8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vnIDXktVJb3BSveXFCdKdMzeLo4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
