One corridor is that of the installation curated by Giovanni Agosti and Jacopo Stoppa at the Triennale di Milano for the 23rd International Exhibition \"Unknown Unknowns\": the visitor crosses it to access four mysterious rooms inspired by natural elements. The other corridor is that of Agosti's own home, a place saturated with books, paintings and objects that contains - conceals - clues, traces and memories of a lifetime. Fiction and reality blur in a dual exploration that leaves unresolved the mystery of what is hidden at the end of the corridor.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/eLrZbugOcGW0joITboB2nhpU1vh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triennale Milano","origin_country":""},{"id":121138,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twin Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tale of a corridor and its meticulous reproduction.","title":"The Red Corridor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4460332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Agosti","original_name":"Giovanni Agosti","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6593e110ebb99d5e6d9fb0b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4460333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacopo Stoppa","original_name":"Jacopo Stoppa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6593e11a069f0e442b2178f4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3880561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Boeri","original_name":"Stefano Boeri","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6593e127ce4ddc6d387ef643","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280646,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Margherita Palli","original_name":"Margherita Palli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6593e133a58902732d961eb9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Rapp","original_name":"Davide Rapp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559e98e22931a01398ec198","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369476,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Olga Stopazzolo","original_name":"Olga Stopazzolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559e9a2b5400214d117e1df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Rapp","original_name":"Davide Rapp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559e9ad0816c700abbec918","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766471,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucio Pontoni","original_name":"Lucio Pontoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559e99822931a01398ec19e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4385578,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tommaso Pessina","original_name":"Tommaso Pessina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559e9d1ea84c7109302c828","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elena Pedrazzini","original_name":"Elena Pedrazzini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559e9bf53866e00e294f8f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLrZbugOcGW0joITboB2nhpU1vh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Triennale Milano : : Il Corridoio Rosso, Trailer","key":"872586767","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-09T14:47:32.000Z","id":"6593e295fc31d3735246a2b7"}]}}}
