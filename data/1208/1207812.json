This horror film of sorts provides a precise description of the places in the Middle East and Europe that formed the backdrop for the early Crusades, following the course of events after a Papal mandate sent half-a-million Franks on a military campaign to ‘reclaim’ Jerusalem from the Muslim armies. To bring these episodes alive, the production uses highly expressive 200-year-old marionettes from the Lupi collection in Turin, dressed in costumes of the Christian and Muslim armies of the time, allowing viewers to momentarily suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in a tragic history, distant in time but not effect.","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":"/2dml2GJ716yDdJkkcBIqdTOdsz9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2015-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cabaret Crusades: The Horror Show Files","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wael Shawky","original_name":"Wael Shawky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b592cea84c71096dff48d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2dml2GJ716yDdJkkcBIqdTOdsz9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
