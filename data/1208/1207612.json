The 10-foot tall, 300-pound, festively painted Fiberglas Doggie Diner Dog Heads are well known in the Bay Area. A popular restaurant chain from 1949 until 1986, there was one Dog head left at one restaurant out on Sloat Avenue by the zoo, which in turn closed down in 2001. That Doghead was salvaged by the city of San Francisco and reinstalled on the traffic median across from the zoo entrance, where it remains to the day.  There are at least 12 existing Dog Heads taken from various restaurants that are in private hands. Three of these surreal objects traveled across the country along with San Francisco’s punk rock performance troop Cyclecide Bike Rodeo to New York City, stopping at roadside attractions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ueca3NwrG2vSsTsSGCR8H6ROBzo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":846,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ueca3NwrG2vSsTsSGCR8H6ROBzo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":573}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
