Bulgaria's astonishingly rich village music traditions include strong women's singing, musical instruments with roots its millennia-old pastoral lifestyle and its 500-year history in the Ottoman Empire, and its lively dancing in additive meters of 5, 7, 9, and 11 beats to the measure. These practices are presented through the lens of a musical family trained during Bulgaria's communist regime (1944-1989) to represent the best that Bulgaria had to offer the world, but who made the wrenching decision in the post-communist period to immigrate to the United States for the sake of their daughters' futures. From that vantage point they have been able to teach their art to, and \"fill the souls\" of, singers, dancers, musicians, and audiences all over the world.","popularity":0.1836,"poster_path":"/d20g6eMD3nk9FZctrAOGlZhnHcQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May It Fill Your Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4386388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kostadin Varimezov","original_name":"Kostadin Varimezov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"655a764df6787a00c6ce7a09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Varimezov","original_name":"Ivan Varimezov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"655a765a0816c700e01ba850","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tzvetanka Varimezova","original_name":"Tzvetanka Varimezova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"655a7666b2e074011e7b7005","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384593,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Timothy Rice","original_name":"Timothy Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65593a9eca0e1700c6ab4277","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d20g6eMD3nk9FZctrAOGlZhnHcQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":868}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210543,"name":"traditional music"},{"id":256427,"name":"bulgarian history"},{"id":266430,"name":"bulgarian folklore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD jacket says 2016.
