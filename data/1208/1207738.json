The film is an in-camera edit with triple exposures, creating a layered and complex visual language. Through this aesthetic, the piece explores themes of queer love and queer ecology. It invites the viewer to enter a unique and poetic world, where the boundaries between the human and natural realms blur and merge. Pushing against human exceptionalism and into a world where there is no ‘natural’ or ‘unnatural.’ Can a walk in the forest, a kiss between lovers, a roll of film, the touch of lichen, liberate ourselves from these hierarchies?","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Konstantin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hogan Seidel","original_name":"Hogan Seidel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b4211b5400214d82e2df8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South Sound Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
