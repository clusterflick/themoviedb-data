Water is in constant motion, changing and transforming, linking everything to everything else on this planet and beyond. 1000 Waters (Oceans & Friends) is part of the 1000 Waters series; video meditations on the element of water. All of the shots in 1000 Waters are culled from my archive of daily video shooting with a consumer camera, a Flip camera or iPhone. Since April 1, 2011, I have been shooting a single-take, 60-second video each day, called a Minute Movie. I recently organized the Minute Movies into a massive database of over 5000 shots. About 20% of the shots in the archive contain water in the form of streams, lakes, the ocean, fountains, waterfalls, bath tubs, sinks, rain, hot springs, and more.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1000 Waters (Oceans & Friends)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Perini","original_name":"Julie Perini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b4407f6787a013a5bdfd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South Sound Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
