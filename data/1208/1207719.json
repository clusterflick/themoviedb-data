Joint championship leader and reigning world champion, Miki Biasion again led the Italian marque's entry. Able support came from Portuguese specialist, Markku Alen, and the dynamic Frenchman Didier Auriol. Alex Fiorio was also entered in an Integrale. The other joint leader, Ingvar Carlsson was absent, Mazda electing to give the event a miss after a disastrous Monte Carlo. Toyota were out in force and had three GTA's for Kankkunen, Waldegaard, and Sainz. Enjoy watching the cars 'yumping' almost at head height - without putting life and limb at the risk to the same extent as the Portuguese spectators.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dze4Bg23SEUWjfFHOY8JsCg5SMj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rally de Portugal 1989","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n43rc1MtM5JzpZvoIT3NUBqZ5xq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dze4Bg23SEUWjfFHOY8JsCg5SMj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
