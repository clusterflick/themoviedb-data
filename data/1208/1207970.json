The film asks how and why Aloni chose these extremes rather than yielding to the warm embrace of the consensus where in fact she grew up and developed. Did she leave the consensus behind or did she reach its outer limits and remained within them?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eikl2VnnYQArwK5OSdMHrMBIFkp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Aloni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4388401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anat Saragusti","original_name":"Anat Saragusti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655bd76a0816c7011a0ed373","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11177348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eikl2VnnYQArwK5OSdMHrMBIFkp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
