He tells him that the bottle once belonged to Captain Rack, a famous pirate who achieved wealth and fame thanks to its magic. Years later, Franco discovers how the bottle seems to work: when he places it on the ground and turns it, it shows him the way to the treasure. So he sets off on an adventurous journey, always following the bottle to find it. Along the way, he meets Luigi Ferrari, a cheerful fellow who lives in a remote mountain hut. Franco uses a trick to persuade him to become his travelling companion. Together they get into all sorts of funny and dangerous situations due to the unpredictable directions the bottle takes them. On their treasure hunt, they open the door to another dimension and meet the pirate Captain Rack. And so disaster takes its course.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/relVxEyIfiwmU1KQPdhZt2jhhlF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Piccolini Media Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":213913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bricc Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die magisch Flasch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Piccolini","original_name":"Franco Piccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Franco Piccolini","credit_id":"655a824cea84c710922a1af4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Ferrari","original_name":"Luigi Ferrari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Luigi Ferrari","credit_id":"655a827c2222f600ac060926","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmut Leiendecker","original_name":"Helmut Leiendecker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Achim","credit_id":"655a8316b5400214cf3a9966","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Steil","original_name":"Chris Steil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chris Steil","credit_id":"655a834153866e00ff09745c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minnie Rock","original_name":"Minnie Rock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Minnie Rock","credit_id":"655a83532222f600fffbcb84","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiny Fuel","original_name":"Tiny Fuel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Captain Rack","credit_id":"655a839b53866e00ff09746e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Piccolini","original_name":"Franco Piccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655a83e1b2e07400ad0b2aaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Ferrari","original_name":"Luigi Ferrari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655a842b0816c700c3ddb61b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Ferrari","original_name":"Luigi Ferrari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655a840cf6787a00c6ce7c2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Piccolini","original_name":"Franco Piccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655a841e67dcc900e337be0d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1083,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/relVxEyIfiwmU1KQPdhZt2jhhlF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":237504,"name":"trierisch"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
