He was taken up in the mental clinic of the Leipzig University soon afterwards. To his rehabilition he wrote an extensive piece of work, \"Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken\" (Memoirs of My Nervous Illness), which was published in 1903 and led to his temporary dismissal. Hereby Schreber became the most quoted psychiatric patient in scientific literature.  This second part was finished after Ernst Schmidt Jr. death by his assistant Susi Praglowski.","popularity":0.1535,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":148663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Continental Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Part 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Part 2","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Widl","original_name":"Susanne Widl","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Daniel Paul Schreber","credit_id":"601be3248a88b2003cb74e02","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Praglowski","original_name":"Susanne Praglowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601be05781a7fc003e022863","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","original_name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601be034b97442003c263ea0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Praglowski","original_name":"Susanne Praglowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601be26ab97442003f273146","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964409,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"G.
