The short film is based on the iconic YLE programme “People’s Radio”, and its visual material has been created by the road movie method of driving across summery Finland.  The film paints a panorama of what Finland looks like today. Its narration progresses through humour into civic anarchy, ultimately also towards the longing for human connection.","popularity":0.3102,"poster_path":"/mayAZDVmspTOrbKluHMoY2MKAMF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":130656,"logo_path":"/1fQX6DQzWuaTC4HZS1OtpYC55HJ.png","name":"Euphoria
