She was a woman of many, contradictory parts: the enthusiastic heterosexual whose most lasting relationship was with a radical lesbian activist; the feminist who adored a father who openly betrayed her mother and neglected his family. In 2008 she transfixed Ireland again when, ravaged by cancer, she turned to her friend and radio host Marian Finucane to talk frankly about her impending death. 'Nuala' is Finucane's journey of discovery into her friend's life as well as a raw and vivid testimony to the enduring power of friendship.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":98008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accidental Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuala: A Life and Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Farrelly","original_name":"Patrick Farrelly","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601b34e61108a8003cc18d1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate O'Callaghan","original_name":"Kate O'Callaghan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601b3502d96c3c003e1ad5a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dublin International Film Festival","release_date":"2012-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
