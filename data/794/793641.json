Each of the features cover something a bit different, as some of the features are a pure \"making of\" type feature, while others might also delve into certain influences and things of that sort. Everyone involved speaks of their approach to their specific feature (or features) and they also talk about how they were approached by the Wachowski's about the Animatrix project and in certain instances, we learn about the director, as well as their work before signing on to this particular project. We get to see footage from the short itself, as well as interview footage with the principals and footage from behind-the-scenes.","popularity":0.2283,"poster_path":"/42GkJ6EdMQ8QOysTQfNh0MOEUp3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Executions: The Making of 'The Animatrix'","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joel Silver","original_name":"Joel Silver","popularity":0.5173,"profile_path":"/5YWxIdEql8yyGWIcF1X3QPQ40u6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"601cbd1268929c003d806f0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lana Wachowski","original_name":"Lana Wachowski","popularity":1.0917,"profile_path":"/4nE4ttPQBuw1virOz0LYT08c1Vm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"601cbd1e9a3c490041ad5a25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lilly Wachowski","original_name":"Lilly Wachowski","popularity":0.4825,"profile_path":"/afRagUzIMpmaA3EyKtfsY5xA9TK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (as Andy Wachowski)","credit_id":"601cbd359a3c49003ead3bbf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Oreck","original_name":"Josh Oreck","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/c5vFWECKAooQKMM7NoVaNTDDIeO.jpg","credit_id":"60312eddd38b58003feeea1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5326076","wikidata_id":"Q96617344","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42GkJ6EdMQ8QOysTQfNh0MOEUp3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
