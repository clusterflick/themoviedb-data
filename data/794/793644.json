Before the war, Darwin was little known except to the crews of pearling luggers and cattlemen. During the war it become an important air base which contributed much to the success of General MacArthur's island-hopping campaign against Japan.  Today Darwin is an aerial port of call for all planes travelling either from Europe or the Far East to Australia.  The Darwin touchdown is, in fact, for many travellers the first sight of the Australian continent. The film shows Darwin as it is today (1949), much ravaged by Japanese attack during World War II, but already showing signs of building activity and general recovery.  The film indicates the general life of the town and also explains the plan which will make Darwin a model city of which Australia will be very proud.","popularity":0.084,"poster_path":"/qsZYOYsbIvfPUoG1HYFAfrwdJly.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian National Film Board","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darwin: Doorway to Australia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Darwin: Gateway to Australia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Robinson","original_name":"Lee Robinson","popularity":0.166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601cc3d2e38bd8003c498f7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1816501","wikidata_id":"Q22569289","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsZYOYsbIvfPUoG1HYFAfrwdJly.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
