[His] new film work will burn colours so deeply into your brain, you'll be watching a light show inside your eyelids for hours. Titled Neige Noir ('Black Snow'), a name that conjures up Toronto winters but actually refers to the trenches of the First World War, the piece is a visual feast. It opens with a calming sequence of manipulated representations of a swimmer and the sea set to a lulling jazz tune, and then crashes into a steady techno and white noise assault with pulsating images. Brown radically alters the celluloid itself, experimenting like a mad scientist to create gorgeous colour patterns. He sometimes refilms an image up to eight times to bring its dance of distortion to a climax. Any single still from this film could bring you to a stop in an art gallery, and Brown gives us some 86,000 of them.\" (Thomas Hirschmann)","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/kbC3nrGr7VUeDmeyvFDG1adwGUF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"neige noire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1590159,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Kamevaar","original_name":"John Kamevaar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601ba9821108a8003fc2dad8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl E.
