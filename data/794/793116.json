Can Mozart himself offer him salvation as he loses himself in his fearful dreams?  Barrie Kosky tells Offenbach's fantastic story as a disturbing nightmare of an artist who increasingly loses his sense of identity. As we dive into the obsessions of a deranged mind, the title role itself is shared by three performers - including an actor - while a single soprano embodies all four female lead roles.","popularity":0.0918,"poster_path":"/dJNazg4NAnvOhpPKMNEfEe85BvW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
