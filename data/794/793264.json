The Falconer weaves his present-day mission with the story of his past, both of which are deeply rooted in issues of social and environmental injustice. Stotts’s worldview in a nutshell: nature heals. In a forgotten corner of our nation’s capital, he takes the time to break through to those too often dismissed as “hard to reach.” This is a story of second chances: for injured birds of prey, for an abandoned plot of land, for a group of teenagers who have dropped out of high school, and for the falconer himself.","popularity":0.1145,"poster_path":"/cWKCiqNlokI9pafCjrJbhJ0m0Aj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155235,"logo_path":null,"name":"3paw Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Falconer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Stotts","original_name":"Rodney Stotts","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"60b6cf0d57d378004288cb57","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Kaempfer","original_name":"Annie Kaempfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b6cf287cffda006dbab734","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Kaempfer","original_name":"Annie Kaempfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b6cf30c740d90079dbe4c0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Stefan Smith","original_name":"William Stefan Smith","popularity":0.1374,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b6cfe2a055ef0040dcef7c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939560,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jason Pollard","original_name":"Jason Pollard","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b6cff0efd3c20041e069b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172528,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Juliet Weber","original_name":"Juliet Weber","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b6d000a8067300578b2895","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Kaempfer","original_name":"Annie Kaempfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601af9a4fb3f610040cc861b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3670876","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"thefalconerfilm","instagram_id":"falconerfilm","twitter_id":"falconerfilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3IB8BleYma5G46DhPrJpYXkyq3A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cWKCiqNlokI9pafCjrJbhJ0m0Aj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mill Valley Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Channel \"America Reframed\"","release_date":"2021-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE FALCONER  Trailer","key":"WkKdB51cFq8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-08T18:46:57.000Z","id":"60b6ce4c5c563400589b7ce2"}]}}}
