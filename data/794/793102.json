Staging a mass revolt against the powers that be, British director Graham Vick has enlisted a good hundred locals and immigrants as demonstrators occupying makeshift camps on the flanks of Sferisterio's impressive open air stage. Sung in simple, modern Italian, Mozart's famous Singspiel takes on a liveliness and spunk that stresses the opera's folk roots and conveys the sense that the action is unfolding around us today.","popularity":0.1015,"poster_path":"/7d2ylw7KYXkBrVc4fmJwAynPtSE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Flute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Sala","original_name":"Giovanni Sala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c46470ead003f73b445","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Loconsolo","original_name":"Guido Loconsolo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2vOpnx2oxkzfpSGRmIFCYTwA1dW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c4dca0e17003e4c0cbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucrezia Drei","original_name":"Lucrezia Drei","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c56e942ee0040f57d82","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleonora Cilli","original_name":"Eleonora Cilli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c5c976a23003daac6e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Di Paola","original_name":"Adriana Di Paola","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c6eb02f5e003f5483ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetiana Zhuravel","original_name":"Tetiana Zhuravel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c7681a7fc003eff8131","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2612076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Pierattelli","original_name":"Manuel Pierattelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c7ebb1057003f99e9a6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Mastrangelo","original_name":"Valentina Mastrangelo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"601a6c85b02f5e003f548422","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Vick","original_name":"Graham Vick","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601a6caa1b70ae003f67196f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963199,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Cohen","original_name":"Daniel Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601a6c9fbc8657003fbbc1dd","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7d2ylw7KYXkBrVc4fmJwAynPtSE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
