Shot during a weekend trip from Victoria BC to Dallas TX for a single DIY concert, it interviews members of Deterioration, Cognizant, and Imperial Slaughter. Live concert footage combines with interviews and Super 8mm film to create an impression of the people who play grindcore, why they love the genre, and their experiences as practitioners of the niche style.","popularity":0.3004,"poster_path":"/yvJ93rft7sLTSvaR5fCF5mEXwA9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitkino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grindcore Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2966159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Joann Lytle","original_name":"Emma Joann Lytle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"601d8fe4aede5900412baf2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2966161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Ariel Gonzalez","original_name":"Stefan Ariel Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Theirself","credit_id":"601d8ff9bc86570045c2d8c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2966162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irving Lopez","original_name":"Irving Lopez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"601d9003b97442003f2a152e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slade Williams","original_name":"Slade Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"601d900ed2f5b5003eacaafe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Thompson","original_name":"Todd Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"601d90187ad08c0040e1a3a5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2680397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ailín Ó Dálaigh","original_name":"Ailín Ó Dálaigh","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hbJIjbwEYqXRZhVDT3fEdn3aLLk.jpg","credit_id":"601d8f98fb3f610040d1d26f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariel Hernandez","original_name":"Dariel Hernandez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bHdwTcGJJunlKa9TbS8E0T6RVtU.jpg","credit_id":"601d8fb01108a8003fc689a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2680397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ailín Ó Dálaigh","original_name":"Ailín Ó Dálaigh","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hbJIjbwEYqXRZhVDT3fEdn3aLLk.jpg","credit_id":"601d8fd0aafebd003fe3ea98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariel Hernandez","original_name":"Dariel Hernandez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bHdwTcGJJunlKa9TbS8E0T6RVtU.jpg","credit_id":"601d8fc6bc8657003ec029ec","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariel Hernandez","original_name":"Dariel Hernandez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bHdwTcGJJunlKa9TbS8E0T6RVtU.jpg","credit_id":"601d8fa4aafebd003fe3ea5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2680397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ailín Ó Dálaigh","original_name":"Ailín Ó Dálaigh","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hbJIjbwEYqXRZhVDT3fEdn3aLLk.jpg","credit_id":"601d8fbcaede5900412baedd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yvJ93rft7sLTSvaR5fCF5mEXwA9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":1556,"name":"texas"},{"id":5720,"name":"dallas texas"},{"id":215522,"name":"british columbia"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":267666,"name":"powerviolence"},{"id":267668,"name":"victoria bc"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"GRINDCORE VACATION Trailer (Ó Dálaigh & Hernandez, 2021)","key":"507834977","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-03T06:13:18.000Z","id":"601d92222e069700406fe073"}]}}}
