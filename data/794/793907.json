They have grown up in a world with increasing droughts, floods, fires. And they share a common fight: the climate emergency. In spite of their cultural and geographical differences, nine young female activists are united under the same struggle: raising awareness about the climate emergency, fighting against the inaction of politicians, and promoting radical societal change, so that nature and social justice become our top priority. In the wake of Greta Thunberg, the most famous of them all, these young women, aged between 12 and 24 years old, already possess the charisma and assurance of some of the history’s greatest political personalities. Who are these activists, set on changing the world? How can we understand their anger? What hopes do they carry? ‘Generation Greta’ recounts the story of these nine incredible young women, combining moving eyewitness accounts and breathtaking archive footage.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":"/xwV34mMIpPiHF9HaG9y1XyTFaWN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galaxie Presse","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generation Greta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Η γενιά της Γκρέτα","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Generation Greta","type":"International Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2328598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Kessler","original_name":"Simon Kessler","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/gQhOB5Nbk9s66urGDSnYZdMAPHS.jpg","credit_id":"601db41afd7aa4003d04a004","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2328598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Kessler","original_name":"Simon Kessler","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/gQhOB5Nbk9s66urGDSnYZdMAPHS.jpg","credit_id":"601db41f55c1f400403bf36e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Boulanger","original_name":"Johan Boulanger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601db42ca199a6004105cf2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Boulanger","original_name":"Johan Boulanger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601db43667dcc90041d4445e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kkQwTemGlh9qTF8EWluW2hCIJGf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xwV34mMIpPiHF9HaG9y1XyTFaWN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2020 Deauville Green Awards","release_date":"2020-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
