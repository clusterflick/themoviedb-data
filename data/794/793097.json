The film combines dance, drama and documentary, but most of all is a story of a friendship of a boy and a girl, and how jolly situations can turn sour and how, even though close, friends do not share same experiences â€“ and that can have an effect on their friendship.","popularity":0.4804,"poster_path":"/ngPmU3rKD1dtH9KwB77WHOZbWHK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Of Course My Films
