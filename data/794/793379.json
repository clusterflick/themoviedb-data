He lives every day with the fractured memories of atrocities he witnessed a decade earlier as a young boy: the murders of his parents and two sisters. To help cope with the upcoming 10-year anniversary of the now infamous and high-profile murders, Dylan agrees to be the subject of a documentary directed by opportunistic true crime vlogger Ethan Lewis (Cody Kilpatrick Steele). As Dylan’s repressed memories gradually resurface, he begins to doubt everything he has ever known about his family’s past – including the truth about his own brother’s involvement in the murders. And when a series of events leads to a renewed public interest in the case, Dylan must confront the truth on his own and find closure once and for all.","popularity":0.3818,"poster_path":"/33Nlv5EqHD4AK5TsBmxnBkfmkFi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleet Street Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There are many ways to cope.","title":"Viscera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Kates","original_name":"Dominic Kates","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dylan","credit_id":"601bb6a0b97442003f2705ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2407166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Steele","original_name":"Cody Steele","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ethan","credit_id":"601bb6abaafebd003de39206","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aimee Theresa","original_name":"Aimee Theresa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"601bb6b4470ead003e756b6e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devin Kates","original_name":"Devin Kates","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Seth","credit_id":"601bb6c2d7a70a003b37781a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Cray","original_name":"Mark Cray","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"John","credit_id":"601c6ad1bb1057003e9f6881","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giancarlo French","original_name":"Giancarlo French","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dylan (Age 6) (voice)","credit_id":"601c6b0857530e003f45a109","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Ushler","original_name":"Bill Ushler","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/dqC5UuCzarD1XjjU3ib2LmxWSFT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Detective Michael Hanlon","credit_id":"601c6b1bcf62cd004107bf01","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2964978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erica Soto","original_name":"Erica Soto","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Alena","credit_id":"601c6b2b470ead0040761782","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dakota Skye Kates","original_name":"Dakota Skye Kates","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Robin","credit_id":"601c6b38c5c1ef003e6f11fc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1493824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Conners","original_name":"Roger Conners","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":"/pwEiB1J8bJX7nTdpmpLam2cSW1K.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ryder","credit_id":"601c771faafebd003ee3854d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Lombardi","original_name":"Roberto Lombardi","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/bvIqGEVBYYJi7jMTXW4cFbMYTfm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Joe Moretti","credit_id":"601c773e470ead0041771312","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2965013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Holbrook","original_name":"David Holbrook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dylan (Reenactment)","credit_id":"601c775313a320003ea48915","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2965014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Wolfe","original_name":"Vincent Wolfe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Seth (Reenactment)","credit_id":"601c7762b97442003c272ac7","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2965016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Merritt","original_name":"Sean Merritt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"John (Reenactment)","credit_id":"601c776fd96c3c003f194434","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2965017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alaina Walsh","original_name":"Alaina Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Tara (Reenactment)","credit_id":"601c777baede59004029c343","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2965036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brynn Casapulla","original_name":"Brynn Casapulla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Robin (Reenactment)","credit_id":"601c7a9c57530e003e46528e","order":15},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2965037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce A.
