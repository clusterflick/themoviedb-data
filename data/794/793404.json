He was taken up in the mental clinic of the Leipzig University soon afterwards. To his rehabilition he wrote an extensive piece of work, \"Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken\" (Memoirs of My Nervous Illness), which was published in 1903 and led to his temporary dismissal. Hereby Schreber became the most quoted psychiatric patient in scientific literature.  This first part of the project, originally conceived as a long feature film, was finished while Ernst Schmidt Jr. was still alive.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1987-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Part 1","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","original_name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601be0058a88b2003eb6db17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","original_name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601be01381a7fc003f033884","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","original_name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601be00b8a88b2003db7c3d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2964398,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Paul Schreber","original_name":"Daniel Paul Schreber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601be01f7314a1003bfd46ff","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vienna (WUK)","release_date":"1987-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
