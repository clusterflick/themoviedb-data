Once there, she finds an ancient mirror deep within the dungeons. Peering into it, Francesca sees a vision of the castle in its former glory, filled with people from decades long passed as well as the image of Antonio, a handsome young man who beckons her to enter the mirror. She soon learns that Antonio and the other souls beyond the glass are ghosts, all cursed by a witch to spend an eternity in limbo. However, Antonio has discovered an hourglass that will allow him to return to the real world to find the Witch and her coven and break the curse, albeit only for a single hour. Together, Francesca and Antonio must venture into the darkest parts of the mirror realm to temporarily break the curse, before the window into Antonio's doomed limbo closes for eternity!","popularity":0.1126,"poster_path":"/6PNelsTwIAMyPAY56hd7eJWP9D3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219782,"logo_path":"/aL53cpdKns4FmECvhwXHgUs4MMf.png","name":"Pulp Noir","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15352,"logo_path":"/sk4KMGNHLCPe03XiQaDmBPnczjy.png","name":"Full Moon Features","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Hourglass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19707,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Band","original_name":"Charles Band","popularity":0.6669,"profile_path":"/mfTZ5yBOLqxdJ4YG0kHaA5rY0G4.jpg","credit_id":"65bcb4ad7646fd0184bf7a94","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31180033","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":978,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6PNelsTwIAMyPAY56hd7eJWP9D3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":648}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
