Employing playful and visually dense digital collages, Braun's associative tableaux collate an 'alternate' vision of our world, where nature invades the urban (and vice-versa). We're transported by a comforting narrator through post-apocalyptic, post-capitalist habitats, where the material co-exists with the metaphysical, the literal alongside the figurative (soap-bubble buildings stand alongside ruined churches turned car dealerships). Architektura echoes our civilization's childlike ingenuity in creation and destruction, as we question the inheritance we pass on to our future generations.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Architektura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joachim Stargard","original_name":"Joachim Stargard","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65be5ab9fc6538017cea4704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John-Patrick Morarescu","original_name":"John-Patrick Morarescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65be5ad11dbc8801491b95be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1825858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Lisa Maiwald","original_name":"Gina Lisa Maiwald","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65be5adc43999b0148c44638","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3231671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niina Lehtonen-Braun","original_name":"Niina Lehtonen-Braun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65be5ae712c604017c009051","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentin Lorenz","original_name":"Valentin Lorenz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65be5af2a7e363016053e48c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milan Braun","original_name":"Milan Braun","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65be5afb12c6040162ffc2c8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulu Braun","original_name":"Ulu Braun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65be5a8943999b0163c505b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulu Braun","original_name":"Ulu Braun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65be5aa9a35c8e017cd47dd4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
