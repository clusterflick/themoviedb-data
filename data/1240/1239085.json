Nevertheless, when the content in their sequence becomes too different, the perception of the actually projected content is stretched to its limits. Shown in individual frames, the alphabet is something we can only assume while placing trust in its reproduction. The 25 frames per second are rendered a visual challenge. Additionally, as the spoken alphabet is condensed into one second, it loses its contours. The story, however, still remains complete; it is interpreted, which makes for the beauty of this film: Not everything needs to be perceived or shown, we fill in the missing parts through interpretation in our heads.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Korpus Grotesk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nik Thoenen","original_name":"Nik Thoenen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb804a459ad601476b06ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
