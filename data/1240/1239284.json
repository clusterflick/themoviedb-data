It came out of a moment when many of us from Ireland gathered at the women’s peace camp, nuclear missile base at Greenham Common (1983), England. The protest ‘Sounds Around the Base’ had 30,000 to 50,000 women surrounding the 9-mile perimeter fence all making sounds on the hour every hour.  There I heard a small group of women keening. I was very struck by this. It was moving, powerful. Back in my studio on Gardiner Street, Dublin my work changed. I changed. It became necessary to use my voice and my body.   Though the equipment was basic or non-existent, it happened, and was essential and seemed vital. I developed a series of calls and out of silence the ‘caoin’ emerged. With the prompt and help of women artist friends I understood something really important and necessary there. I understood I had to pursue this.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chant Down Greenham","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanna O’Kelly","original_name":"Alanna O’Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc0cc37646fd0184be603b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
