Featuring men and women skiers from Norway, France, Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands, and Japan, this story serves as a reminder that sometimes the most profound communication occurs when words are not needed at all. From bottomless pow turns in majestic Japanese forests to the high volcanic alpine of central Hokkaido, Lexicon reminds us of the transformative power of adventure, cultural exchange, and the bonds we can create when we embrace our shared passions and the inherent joy of connecting with people from different walks of life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cALHYrNyIMJfOuqN48D5mEEEEfl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LEXICON","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maude
