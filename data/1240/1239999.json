The director spent nearly a year interviewing faith leaders across a spectrum of beliefs, along with scholars, politicians, and everyday peopleâ€”all discussing how their views of religious texts and traditions support marriage among any two consenting adults. The title, \"God Votes No,\" stems from the effort to defeat a proposal on the November 2012 ballot to define marriage in the Minnesota state constitution as the exclusive domain of one man and one woman. \"God Votes No\" features interviews with U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, practicing Mormons Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker of the Duluth band Low, and author Jay Michaelson, among many others.","popularity":0.0817,"poster_path":"/lxQLBbapiIsOrSoYFborqI4UUdA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God Votes No","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"God Votes No: Voices From the Religious Left for Marriage Equality","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":523439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Ellison","original_name":"Keith Ellison","popularity":0.1825,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65be625812c6040162ffc689","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damon Heitman","original_name":"Damon Heitman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65be625fa35c8e0163d476b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lohman","original_name":"David Lohman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65be626a6c449c01498c1cf4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth MacAulay","original_name":"Elizabeth MacAulay","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65be6270ba48020161697ac2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa McMullen","original_name":"Lisa McMullen","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65be627f43999b0148c44895","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Michaelson","original_name":"Jay Michaelson","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65be6287031deb0162ee64df","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1200255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Parker","original_name":"Mimi Parker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65be628f43999b0163c50c50","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Simon","original_name":"Melissa Simon","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65be62abfc65380163e97fa7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Smith","original_name":"Jim Smith","popularity":0.0339,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65be62b21dbc8801301b5bd8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Sparhawk","original_name":"Alan Sparhawk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65be62c21dbc88017c1d15cc","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cooper Wiggen","original_name":"Cooper Wiggen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65be62c8031deb0183ef3e76","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352536,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matt Peiken","original_name":"Matt Peiken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65be61fd902012017ccb554c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2633320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lxQLBbapiIsOrSoYFborqI4UUdA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
