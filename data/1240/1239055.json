This narrative is set in remote villages of Maharashtra where girls, from an extremely young age, have to bear the laborious task of fetching water for their households. The ordeal involves traveling long distances, often under scorching heat and sometimes barefoot, balancing heavy pots of water on their heads. This day-to-day hardship deprives the girls of their innocent childhood and obstructs their educational pursuits. Jyoti and Rani, who aspire to become a policewoman and a nurse respectively, find their dreams fading away amidst the toil of water collection.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Water Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25604426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
