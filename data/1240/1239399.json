The film weaves us in and out of a subconscious space where Carter processes suppressed emotions triggered by events and relationships in the real world. Although his English teacher pushes him to get involved in a poetry showcase and develop his talents, a racist bully and avoidant father operates against him. Over the course of the story, the conflict blends both real and imagined spaces parallel to Carter’s evolution from repression to expression.","popularity":0.0967,"poster_path":"/fP1Gv5wNEwMs89zQaevWE2SmJxF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Babellion Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A poem for class becomes a reflection of a young boy’s tormented soul.","title":"SIMMER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Yillah","original_name":"Max Yillah","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Carter Williams","credit_id":"65bc624fd556970183ab198f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4169632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Konnovitch","original_name":"Stephen Konnovitch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wlrMqdWNKyzAmL6pNvlTj11iPkG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anthony Parks","credit_id":"65bc62697646fd0184beebe2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Elpenord","original_name":"Emmanuel Elpenord","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Richard Williams","credit_id":"65bc6275459ad601616c2774","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendi Smith","original_name":"Wendi Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Peters","credit_id":"65bc62b52d1e4001845d0397","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Afiriyie","original_name":"Joshua Afiriyie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc62c75c071b013171f752","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Afiriyie","original_name":"Joshua Afiriyie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc62d12b8a4301471a967e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513415,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mae Stokes","original_name":"Mae Stokes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc62ded7cd06014853ad59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511146,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Caleb Leanza","original_name":"Caleb Leanza","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc62e8459ad6017a6d527d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513416,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jalen Ramseur-Williams","original_name":"Jalen Ramseur-Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc6301c144dd0149fddf64","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4496056,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Snook","original_name":"Oliver Snook","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc6344e18b97017b9b0f5b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/he8DjVEWt5SOEPvcQlYs3ATOVKO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fP1Gv5wNEwMs89zQaevWE2SmJxF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hdJdckNgYNDOp1vK967qCgzHHuX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Behind the Scenes of SIMMER dir.
