Inside, four surveillance cameras showing different rooms. A woman in a winter coat enters the hallway, holding a large plate of cake. As if in a secret surveillance centre, we look at four monitors and watch the figures in black mourning clothes move from room to room. In the centre of it all is our main character, who tries in vain to escape the countless expressions of condolence. The traditional mourning rite as a social gauntlet.  \"Dein Beileid\" was shot in two planned sequences with four cameras running in parallel. It is a play with the medium of film, an experiment with parallelism. With each viewing, the audience can focus their attention on new aspects and actively explore the plot and relationships. Depending on what we focus on, the film is sad, humorous, or in any case deeply atmospheric.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/6z8wFLWTXG9jx00IM5WxcJJiYV6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dein Beileid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Bereuther","original_name":"Samuel Bereuther","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bbf11c459ad601476b1e83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6z8wFLWTXG9jx00IM5WxcJJiYV6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
