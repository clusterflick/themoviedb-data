Now Jodie is taking on the biggest challenge of her life, as she intends to transform her passion into a profession by training as a tattooist. She'll spend time with professionals like Nikole Lowe and Louis Molloy and after attending art classes and building a portfolio, will learn the trade as an apprentice. As Jodie's ambition is to open her own studio, she will need to learn every aspect of the trade. Along the way, Jodie will be faced with many different challenges as she prepares to create a tattoo for a very important customer - her dad!","popularity":0.0649,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jodie Marsh: Tattoo Apprentice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1219005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jodie Marsh","original_name":"Jodie Marsh","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/2oyT4RubVrQUnG48cPDehn93HUz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65bd452211c066017bd2e72e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikole Lowe","original_name":"Nikole Lowe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65bd4553c144dd017c01595b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4514533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Molloy","original_name":"Louis Molloy","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65bd45b6e18b97017b9c4ba6","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
