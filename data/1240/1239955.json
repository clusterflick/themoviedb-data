Directly from the core of the imagined, those invisible thoughts are transformed on the screen into the concrete of the experienced, simultaneously setting the unyielding concept in motion. Images in the mind are superimposed by the destruction that is both color and life. The ink transforms itself like a fuel-powered illusion, that begins and ends like a Fata Morgana - barely there, and then once again vanished. The synapses of a hyperactive psyche - transposed on paper.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut Fran√ßais","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Soldier's Head","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Rebet","original_name":"Christine Rebet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65be4cff9020120162ca82c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
