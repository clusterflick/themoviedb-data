On top of sharing the same name, these two places also share a fraught relationship with sand.  Singapore, Michigan was a thriving lumber town in the late 19th century until erosion from mass deforestation caused the sand dunes around it to shift and swallow the town whole. Just as quickly as Singapore, Michigan disappeared under sand, its namesake in the East emerged from it through land reclamation.  The film weaves a narrative that intertwines the two Singapores to depict the temporal nature of human edifices built on and destroyed by nothing more than sand.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rUNCIb3LZbwzY7CVTkePUJCSDdH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An exploration of impermanence through two parallel cities of sand","title":"Sandcastles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4514165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marin Loh","original_name":"Marin Loh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd0c71c144dd017c012590","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499756,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jaydn Ray Gosselin","original_name":"Jaydn Ray Gosselin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd0c4de18b970148990015","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carin Jin-Yi Leong","original_name":"Carin Jin-Yi Leong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd0c4111c0660162d0fc60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596955,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Cook","original_name":"Charlotte Cook","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd0d1d7646fd0184bfdc3f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4514168,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Qiu","original_name":"James Qiu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd0c8ad556970183ac4b66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacob Fertig","original_name":"Jacob Fertig","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd0c5f11c066017bd2b3cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUNCIb3LZbwzY7CVTkePUJCSDdH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
