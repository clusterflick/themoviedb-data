In bed, APRIL SANCHEZ and JENNA BRYANT hatch a plan to turn the plot of Hitchcock's \"Strangers on a Train\" into reality. The two women, who met by accident in a bar, quickly became secret lovers, and shared not only their bodies, but their innermost anger and sorrow. Now, they will each kill the others' \"spouse\"; and since there is no connection between the two, no one will suspect them. The Perfect Murder. But, true to any Hitchcock movie, things are not always what they seem to be.","popularity":0.3666,"poster_path":"/4JQK3NB0x4zlpZNB239PvGVsjqG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alibi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa K.
