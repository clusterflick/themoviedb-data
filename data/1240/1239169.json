Obsessed by past images of herself as a baby in a carriage, she uncovers a simple fact concerning her mother that explains why she has been haunted by them ever since. This is realized through an interweaving of her present life (on a therapist's couch) and the visual fragments she has retained of that day. Having located the source of her pain, she is now able to go forward with newfound understanding.","popularity":0.3751,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Blink of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Black-Eyed Susan","original_name":"Black-Eyed Susan","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Therapist","credit_id":"65bbbcac2b8a4301611b2f4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4512509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Gibson","original_name":"Brittany Gibson","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Baby","credit_id":"65bbbcb7d556970183aa2a08","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Plimpton","original_name":"Martha Plimpton","popularity":1.0051,"profile_path":"/bCfhOm4WRb2X5RQdfz5TpMvMZ1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"65bbbcc81fd36f0163725f2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Young","original_name":"Karen Young","popularity":0.4183,"profile_path":"/yriHai0AZfT39CYO4v0rFxEX3rY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Patient","credit_id":"65bbbcd2cffeed017cae078f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Young","original_name":"Karen Young","popularity":0.4183,"profile_path":"/yriHai0AZfT39CYO4v0rFxEX3rY.jpg","credit_id":"65bbbc5bcffeed00c8ac9ab3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Young","original_name":"Karen Young","popularity":0.4183,"profile_path":"/yriHai0AZfT39CYO4v0rFxEX3rY.jpg","credit_id":"65bbbc61e18b970162994b07","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0497551","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"1992-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
