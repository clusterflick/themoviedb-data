Though he has written in other forms, he is renowned for his operas, for which he also writes the libretti. The most famous and popular is his third opera, Susannah, premiered in 1955 and the second most preformed in all American operas. Updated and set in Tennessee, it is loosely based on the Apocryphal tale of Susannah and the Elders. The work is rooted in vernacular folk melodies, hymns, and contains soaring melodic beauty.”  In the opera 'Susannah;’ Susannah Polk becomes the target of false accusations and scandalous rumors spread by the local church community. Her innocence is challenged, leading to tragic consequences as Susannah fights to defend her honor and integrity in the face of small-town prejudice and bigotry.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/o2YXO5QmEiNOuYwMJtSg8m59akZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greyhouse
