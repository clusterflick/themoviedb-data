In a flow of oxidized images and suspended visions, a rarefied dialogue unfolds between woman and machine. A confrontation at the threshold between presence and absence, human and artificial, where reality shatters and identity dissolves. A hypnagogic journey into the depths of a thought shared between one who was programmed to exist and one who is no longer certain of doing so.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2026-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Room174","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5263407,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Maria Bernardi","original_name":"Maria Bernardi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697297809ac7d0f610dca1d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London Short Film Festival ","release_date":"2026-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
