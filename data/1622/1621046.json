After several visits to the most east-bound district of interwar Czechoslovakia, one director and one photographer decided to return to the same places once more this time with a film camera to bring back a message about the calm but original daily life of the local people. With a slightly detached point of view they follow the uneasy life of several individuals who weren’t able to choose their destiny, but who refuse to grumble about it. Transcarpathia is a place where the flow of time has stopped, but it doesn’t really bother anyone.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half Past Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1558679,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomáš Hodan","original_name":"Tomáš Hodan","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721eea41597353a291a985","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2314258,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Braňo Pažitka","original_name":"Braňo Pažitka","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721f1a3eeb50da3cebac5d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2319995,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Filip Šturmankin","original_name":"Filip Šturmankin","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721f25ec678720246e704b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1558679,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomáš Hodan","original_name":"Tomáš Hodan","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721f30c0ca56975c0969cd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5955442,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Štěpán Hon","original_name":"Štěpán Hon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721f3cfaf518fc55096a55","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Ryndová","original_name":"Anna Ryndová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721f4bd4b31af0eddaa61b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5955444,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vopli Vidopliassova","original_name":"Vopli Vidopliassova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721f5850042bb16e91a894","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2117553,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Slezák","original_name":"Robert Slezák","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69721f63c4aa39be16093be8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
