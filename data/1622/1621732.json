There, Max Herbst, a former tram driver, is to show him around the city. On the first day, they travel to the Hamburg elevated railway depot in Barmbek, naturally by subway and elevated railway. During the trip, they see vivid and memorable images of life in the Hanseatic city at that time. During the factory tour, they are shown not only the repair workshops of the elevated railway, but also how electricity for railway operations was generated in the power station at that time. A family outing to the countryside is planned for the next day. Max Herbst's daughter, Bubikopf, is also part of the group. They take the Walddörferbahn to Volksdorf, then continue with three-axle Büssing buses and the tram. The eventful day ends with a trip on an Alster steamboat. However, Bubikopf and Hein Puttfarcken have eyes only for each other.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qHnZU86VbCnuFlYAt4U6Ru9BQkC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1925-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamburg hat's eilig!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Zeisler","original_name":"Alfred Zeisler","popularity":0.2042,"profile_path":"/jeN5Zj9wgv0oEqwS9LqhSi3PIBe.jpg","credit_id":"6973ac5d1f7ec9b8d5380c77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":"DE","iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qHnZU86VbCnuFlYAt4U6Ru9BQkC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1071}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
