The two teenagers were challenged to travel throughout Bristol without their pocket companions as we faced them with challenging tasks for one whole day.  Activities the two would surely need to use their phones for, such as listening to relics of unfamiliar music and blindly navigating the city to hidden, mysterious spots. In the “Big 25” how would anyone listen to music without streaming services?  Do they fail? Are they left stranded? Will they fight their addiction?\r All this to determine whether it's possible to survive in the modern world without a phone.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two teenagers have to face modern Bristol without a phone.","title":"Unplugged","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
