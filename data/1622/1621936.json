As he prepares his boat alongside his team, traces of a past season, a defeat, and an accident quietly resurface. The film gradually drifts from the concrete reality of technical labor into a more intimate and nocturnal dimension. Through fragments of memory, archival materials, and abstract imagery, it explores the fragile boundary between control and vulnerability, wakefulness and dream.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Shift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Night Shift - Bande annonce - Sailorz Film Festival 2026","key":"IEQ41RBoTTY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2026-01-22T16:08:09.000Z","id":"6974153885f71390deab90ce"}]}}}
