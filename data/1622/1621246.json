The veto itself isn’t going away—it’s ‘veto-proof’. But when vetoes are cast in the face of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, obligations under international law and the UN Charter must be considered.  Such veto uses have led to massive loss of life, displacement of millions, and the multilateral order pushed to a breaking point.  The film, featuring leading global experts, puts aside ‘the impossibility of change’ and explores real paths to breaking the Security Council deadlock, and avoiding a third global conflict.  This is an urgent film for global audiences — it’s an issue that truly affects us all.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ymZV1iagqILK0KJtuffIA2TAoXv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":286971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vast Productions
