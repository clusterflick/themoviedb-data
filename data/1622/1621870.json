He received quite a bit of success from his writing and was eventually given parole in 1990. However, the 'Poet of Death' had a taste for murder and resumed his grizzly ways on release. After being linked to murders in Austria, America and Czechoslovakia, Unterweger was arrested in Los Angeles and extradited back to Austria. He was found guilty of nine murders, despite there being little evidence to prove it beyond doubt, and was found hanging from his cell roof less than 24 hours after being sentenced to life for a second time.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rjAQ16oC585qX3pwLDYfKN9IjI4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Austrian poet whose insatiable appetite for death led him to kill at least 9 prostitutes","title":"Jack Unterweger - Poet of Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1629,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rjAQ16oC585qX3pwLDYfKN9IjI4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1086}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
