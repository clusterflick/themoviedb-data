Their journey soon becomes more than a climbing challenge. Forgotten photographs and traces of legendary guide Alphonse Couttet reveal that these Madonnas may hold secrets reaching far beyond the summits. Crossing three nations, the pair embark on a quest that intertwines adventure with heritage, uncovering an ancient wisdom shared by generations of mountaineers.
