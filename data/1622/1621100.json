The copper bowl sat in the middle of O’Connell Bridge and plastic flames lit up inside it. It was one of many public art installations around the capital, but no piece captured the attention of the public quite like ‘The Thing’.  Built in 1953 for the Tóstal (an event aimed to help encourage visitors to come to Ireland as a tourist destination) it was one of many public sculptures that were located in Dublin from 1953 – 1958. ‘The Thing’ however was met with much controversy and disdain from its arrival and the removal of it was a cause of celebration for many. It was still vandalised and attacked on numerous occasions, even after several attempts to improve it (flowers were planted in it). Engineers declared it too heavy for the bridge and it was finally removed.\r -IFI Archive","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'The thing' is removed from O'Connell Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
