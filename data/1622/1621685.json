Peppered with Robert Service poems read by New Zealand-born Hollywood actor Russell Crowe, the film recounts how stampedes of fortune seekers came to the Yukon from far and wide in 1897. Less than half of the 100,000 adventurers ever finished the treacherous journey. Archival photographs re-create the saga of the Klondike, including stories from the deadly Chilkoot Pass and Dawson City itself, where fortunes were made and lost overnight. With a personal stake and a sense of wonder, filmmaker Rita Roy discovers a territory still vibrant with legends, and miners still panning for gold under the spell of the harsh yet stunning wilderness.","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":"/w0X12s5975pf1FiXrtwL7xF7gNP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spell of the Yukon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Roy","original_name":"Rita Roy","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"6973970b5455d6b0f79d0a27","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Crowe","original_name":"Russell Crowe","popularity":3.9882,"profile_path":"/uxiXuVH4vNWrKlJMVVPG1sxAJFe.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Robert Service's poems read by (voice)","credit_id":"6973972df1f5c78b6c942b07","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Roy","original_name":"Rita Roy","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6973953a2884cd3841aee2fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Roy","original_name":"Rita Roy","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69739547221f1ecafcdca7a0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Roy","original_name":"Rita Roy","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697395513ee9addfc1e3db57","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Roy","original_name":"Rita Roy","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6973955c221f1ecafcdca7a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":244625,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Grana","original_name":"Sam Grana","popularity":0.2208,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697395697db40dcd5c9d0978","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Haig","original_name":"Don Haig","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697395762884cd3841aee302","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5957859,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wayne James","original_name":"Wayne James","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6973959539d2c3199fdca71b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Barry Perles","original_name":"Barry Perles","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697395b2149ba0f7259d09dd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raymond Vermette","original_name":"Raymond Vermette","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697395c03ee9addfc1e3db68","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29453,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Milan Kymlička","original_name":"Milan Kymlička","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697395d2e8159a702213d269","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5243966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w0X12s5975pf1FiXrtwL7xF7gNP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":189390,"name":"yukon, canada"},{"id":207684,"name":"canadian history"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":314221,"name":"yukon gold rush"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
