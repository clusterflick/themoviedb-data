Through film, sound, and light, boundaries dissolve between inner and outer worlds, living and non-living matter. Inspired by quantum theory, Huyghe collaborated with physicist Tommaso Calarco and philosopher Tobias Rees. The film translates quantum uncertainty into sensory experiences, with sound design even shaped by a 100-qubit quantum computer. Ultimately, Huyghe invites us to confront a “radical outside” of human subjectivity, where multiple realities coexist.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/nhsnzxmB9ULTPIpz4TwaQv6P0ok.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":261285,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hartwig Art Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2026-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A faceless figure in a quantum dance beyond reality","title":"Liminals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Huyghe","original_name":"Pierre Huyghe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cUNy3jtEVobQbmJyuZ7nkmXdBcR.jpg","credit_id":"69735978e5cd9e0402dca610","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5957421,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paola Ravagni","original_name":"Paola Ravagni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69735a52e5cd9e0402dca62b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphaël Siboni","original_name":"Raphaël Siboni","popularity":0.0531,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69735a7ac29174e95baee084","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325441,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laura Estevez","original_name":"Laura Estevez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69735aad02b5e42d9d893d2c","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5957425,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pablo Verdugo","original_name":"Pablo Verdugo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69735ac719060ac949893ee7","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415273,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florence Cohen","original_name":"Florence Cohen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69735b131dc806c7b7e3d59d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1692,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nhsnzxmB9ULTPIpz4TwaQv6P0ok.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1124}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
