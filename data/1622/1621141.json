Utilizing rare archival materials and staged scenes depicting moments from her life, the film traces the career of this pioneer who played a key role in the transition of cinema into a narrative medium. The work goes beyond celebrating her technical milestones —such as her early experiments with sound or the founding of an independent production company in the United States— to offer a sharp critique of the historical silence and erasure imposed on her work by scholars and film archives. Ultimately, the documentary serves as a necessary act of rediscovery to uncover the deep roots of female creativity in the cinematic world and challenges the traditional narratives that have long excluded women as active creative forces","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qui est Alice Guy?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","original_name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","popularity":0.4913,"profile_path":"/y1atPvIVDpS2pJR2rnQZ4VR7ULM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"697246081f3d8e3d3291aa53","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1798611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole-Lise Bernheim","original_name":"Nicole-Lise Bernheim","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/qeVcozDZtm4UZBGT373Htkd4fcH.jpg","credit_id":"697245f4d5576794f0093d55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
