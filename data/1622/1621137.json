The narrative unfolds through images of bodily experiences, interspersed with spoken words, fragments of sentences, and music. Rather than a traditional story, it presents a sequence of gestures of suffering, pleasure, and self-gratification, described as \"gestures of sculpture\". The work documents a search for identity that remains fragmented and ongoing, capturing discussions that reflect a \"woman-movement\" in its developmental stage. Ultimately, it serves as a record of a collective consciousness caught in the very act of its formation","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un geste en moi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danielle Jaeggi","original_name":"Danielle Jaeggi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697244603b15663668096b5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5955626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Levavasseur","original_name":"Nicole Levavasseur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697244a773d442e88782072c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5955627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monique David","original_name":"Monique David","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697244b6f714ee4c92ebac52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
