The story is about a group of petty criminals, basically kids hanging around on street-corners, in a sleepy Chinese coastal town. Leizi is a member of the local militia, but bored stiff. With tough friends like Hei-di, his girlfriend Ah-hua who prostitutes herself, and Qingmao who has just returned from prison, Leizi spends his time drinking and keeping the neighbourhood awake. They extort money from Ah-hua's clients and sell things for the local gangster, Mr. Lian. When Leizi meets the righteous daughter of the Christian foreman, he starts having his doubts about his lifestyle. But the chain of violence, starting with extortion and kidnapping and ending in murder, has already started and no one can escape it.\" - IFFR","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pWtd3CS2VrfGPJvuH19swbGA5Wy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tattoo","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Liren","original_name":"Wang Liren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3103c16a300b1834a5286f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Liren","original_name":"Wang Liren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d310410326c1900111e1259","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364912,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Li Xiaofu","original_name":"Li Xiaofu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d31042b326c19000e1e04cd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Liren","original_name":"Wang Liren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3104362f8d094522d38fe4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365163,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ningru","original_name":"Ningru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d310445326c19000e1e050c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304960,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helen Cui","original_name":"Helen Cui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d310456326c19000f1e089a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7786614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.632,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWtd3CS2VrfGPJvuH19swbGA5Wy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
