His story takes us through two millennia of music, from a fragment of papyrus preserving the earliest known piece of Christian music to the stories behind Hark the Herald Angels Sing, Silent Night and In the Bleak Midwinter, and the work of popular Christmas composer, John Rutter. Music is performed by Harry Christophers and his choir, The Sixteen.","popularity":0.3481,"poster_path":"/floBjNUjPxh1WczYkUW9fHslo3F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sacared Music story of Christmas music","title":"A Christmas History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Sacred Music: A Christmas History","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Russell Beale","original_name":"Simon Russell Beale","popularity":0.4369,"profile_path":"/9isa16qmTVHxVws4lhVarLxKmVX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5d31b0c02f8d090010d76334","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy King-Dabbs","original_name":"Andy King-Dabbs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8d3e7b9f0e190018f335b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy King-Dabbs","original_name":"Andy King-Dabbs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8d3ea487e63e00152ae591","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":797,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/floBjNUjPxh1WczYkUW9fHslo3F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"},{"id":247715,"name":"christian music"},{"id":299268,"name":"christmas carols"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
