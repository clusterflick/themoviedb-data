The first chapter, \"Wicked\", set during the reign of King Rama VI, tells of a village deep within a forest. It is plagued with unexplainable events that are believed to have been brought on by a curse. The second chapter, \"Tattoo\", is about a cruel curse that is embroidered through ink into the victim's skin, forcing them to carry the curse until they die. In the third and final chapter, \"Wife's Curse\", it follows a person who has accumulated damning curses to the point of no return, which no good deed can ever erase. His fate will be decided by those curses.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
