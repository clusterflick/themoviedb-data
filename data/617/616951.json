Following the budding friendship of Kelly (Kelly Lloyd, Baltimore Improv Group), a bored housewife, and Chris (Chris Milner, Comedy Central), a displaced Londoner, this film takes an honest look at life by disposing of conventional on-screen relationships. Bored exposes the inherent drama in the silences between what people say and don't say to each other.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bNLpgF0ufq2wF4EKoO126UXf5dd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bored in the U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3257559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Finazzo","original_name":"Mike Finazzo","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e6545180dea002bbffad4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3257559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Finazzo","original_name":"Mike Finazzo","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e655467e0f7004387f141","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8661030","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bNLpgF0ufq2wF4EKoO126UXf5dd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
