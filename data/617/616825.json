Going against the grain in the conservative atmosphere of the city formerly known as the Oil Capital of the World, bands such as Los Reactors, NOTA, Pitbulls On Crack, Bunnies of Doom, Baby M, Brother Inferior, Tex Montana's Green Party and many others struggled to make a name for themselves releasing their own music and playing local and national venues. Oil Capital Underground is filled with rare live footage, flyers, photos and interviews with many of the colorful musicians, promoters and club owners discussing the music, personalities and social climate of the time.","popularity":0.1056,"poster_path":"/yGH9eKJkpsJuzPgjQSksd0dH5WT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oil Capital Underground: The Genesis & Evolution of Punk Rock in Tulsa-Late 70's to Mid 90's","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Crain","original_name":"Bryan Crain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3210a32f8d095259d7cf17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Crain","original_name":"Bryan Crain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3210c1d19a3300114ebcc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dave Cantrell","original_name":"Dave Cantrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3210e4caab6d31b2a450a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365732,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Terry Waska","original_name":"Terry Waska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3210fbcaab6d31b2a450e3","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Crain","original_name":"Bryan Crain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3210d1d19a3300114ebcf7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10332416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGH9eKJkpsJuzPgjQSksd0dH5WT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
