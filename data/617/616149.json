The conclusion of the trilogy deals with the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, who attempted to establish a kind of monotheistic cult around the god Aton during his reign in the 14th century BC, but failed due to the resistance of the priesthood. The production presented here was undoubtedly one of the very great successes of the 2019/20 season at New York’s Metropolitan Opera, due not only to the outstanding cast of singers (led by countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo) but also to Phelim McDermott’s imaginative staging, which captivates with sometimes breathtaking imagery.","popularity":1.1442,"poster_path":"/3Ky5f9FIlds2gWGirjEMMSd79ym.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Akhnaten","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Metropolitan Opera: Live in HD — Akhnaten","type":"Live HD broadcast series"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Roth Costanzo","original_name":"Anthony Roth Costanzo","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/u0zh34TlcPWLrqSm2rgqTLz2xy8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Akhnaten","credit_id":"5dc86fd36c0e4f00133b7cc5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J’Nai Bridges","original_name":"J’Nai Bridges","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/nLOF1EII8w4dY2J4O97WdUsDf9D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nefertiti","credit_id":"5dc87024470ead001396fbff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dísella Lárusdóttir","original_name":"Dísella Lárusdóttir","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/re4NIbYhJslPt7GbuTiEgfb7L5s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Queen Tye","credit_id":"5dc87007470ead00189706a8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1976532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary James","original_name":"Zachary James","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":"/rBCvxOI1ewwAVoJxBYC1Ydjx4fg.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Amenhotep III / A professor","credit_id":"5eefac066e3deb0036a258df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Berstein","original_name":"Richard Berstein","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/ngtj50bpVwlBw1JaX0bgSlEi4eh.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Aye","credit_id":"5eefac166e3deb0038a2484e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Liverman","original_name":"Will Liverman","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/uMpqumlxwRguvOIspDhtBIpxw9H.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"General Horemhab","credit_id":"5eefac2f10dad60031bfa8ff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Blake","original_name":"Aaron Blake","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4nOqrrJMmmtMqGVPkCEAoVACq5C.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"High Priest of Amon","credit_id":"5dc870be6c0e4f00133b7e3b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay Ohse","original_name":"Lindsay Ohse","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/cphF6rrc8p4REknlTkGQ6Y1maUA.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Bekhetaten","credit_id":"5eefac4e283ed900378d1068","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2686739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Chia-ling Ho","original_name":"Karen Chia-ling Ho","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/xusNIO5hvjE99wKHlyEs8f3DULv.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Meretaten","credit_id":"5eefac63568463003501b2d8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrystal E.
