While the Nazis were tyrannizing Europe, the young Wojtyla worked in a rock quarry, where he acquired a lifelong respect for the dignity of labor. In his spare time, Wojtyla hiked & enjoyed other athletic pursuits, wrote poetry, & dabbled in acting on the stage, but he increasingly felt called to the priesthood. Ordained in 1946, Wojtyla & the Catholic church faced fresh challenges after the fall of Hitler, as new Communist rulers were quick to curtail religious & civil liberties. The documentary profile John Paul the Great follows Wojtyla s path from his birth in the Polish town of Wadowice in 1920 to Rome, where in 1978 s year of three Popes, he unexpectedly ascended Saint Peter s throne to become head of the Catholic Church, serving until his death in 2005.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4yzmqPu02qw6RKD5y8EfQUiWvbC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Paul the Great: A Pope Who Made History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4yzmqPu02qw6RKD5y8EfQUiWvbC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
