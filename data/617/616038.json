This record only represents the 200,000-plus feet of unedited film that Sergei Eisenstein, Grigoriy Aleksandrov and Eduard Tisse shot in Mexico 1931/32 for Mary and Upton Sinclair and three American co-financiers. It was Eisenstein's vision to end up with movie about Mexico in six parts called \"Calavera\", \"Sandunga\", \"Maguey\", \"Fiesta\", \"Soldadera\", and \"Epilogue\". The project was canceled before it was completed due to cost overruns and months-delayed completion, and the producers refused to let Eisenstein attempt to edit anything from the material he had finished after Iosif Stalin called him back to the USSR. From this footage the following pictures were subsequently edited by other hands: Thunder Over Mexico (1933), Eisenstein in Mexico (1933), Death Day (1934), Time in the Sun (1940), and Que Viva Mexico (1979).","popularity":0.1094,"poster_path":"/dNfI9Jiv8TyYuGi3wFqVAgiIshu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91802,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Mexican Picture Trust","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hurray Mexico!","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigori Aleksandrov","original_name":"Григорий Александров","popularity":0.3583,"profile_path":"/gY3az71QDIwBrl2POLb2tvaKkrg.jpg","credit_id":"5d2e1144caab6d31b2990d3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Eisenstein","original_name":"Сергей Эйзенштейн","popularity":0.3728,"profile_path":"/ks9uuDtKu9m9w50t18PamLZ91to.jpg","credit_id":"5d2e0fd666e4690011810343","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0022756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZOVjF5GTJe388BUPfz0VwJEaUa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jAOzKE8ja6MIzMR98vDnl3gPgvC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/KvZfzQzfx6QGgoeq2GCwHVsCs1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":929,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dNfI9Jiv8TyYuGi3wFqVAgiIshu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":625},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/mTOrO0QLGHELNiHXLyUgn6TRJUJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1320,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNXrOSual2ATXFAt9kK5Uu7spg6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":880},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/83W9qBxSG59tAuvKX3e3NGy0We5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":950},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/9OC7BpzgkOlvIsiu4lyf39mRRFT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Exact date unknown","release_date":"1932-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
