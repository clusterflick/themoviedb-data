Drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese theater, Minghella’s staging retells this heartbreaking tale with brilliant stagecraft, bold colors, and bunraku puppetry. In this Live in HD performance from the fall of 2019, Chinese soprano Hui He stars as Cio-Cio-San, the young geisha who puts her trust in a visiting American naval officer, only to later be abandoned by him. In a feat of operatic heroics, tenor Bruce Sledge appears as the callous Pinkterton, stepping into the role on short notice to replace an ailing colleague. Pier Giorgio Morandi conducts one of opera’s most tragic masterpieces, leading a cast that also includes mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong as Cio-Cio-San’s loyal companion, Suzuki, and Tony Award–winning baritone Paulo Szot as the U.S. consul Sharpless.","popularity":0.7272,"poster_path":"/q57kpa1pe66Sp1JMVIFN92HLdsO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Madama Butterfly","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1320848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hui He","original_name":"Hui He","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/kPPBWpEWYv0Hn6lQVV751pi76xN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cio-Cio-san","credit_id":"5ea4ec47db72c0001dbcf788","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2221758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Sledge","original_name":"Bruce Sledge","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lt.
