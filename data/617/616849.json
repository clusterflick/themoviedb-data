Hurt's recollections about the role and the crazy makeup he worked in, are fascinating, as are the stories about the makeup artist using the real remains of John Merrick archived in the London hospital. A shorter bit has the artist explaining the exact construction of his amibitious makup, and he also narrates a slide show that includes color photos of the finished work. There are some mind-boggling stills of the real Merrick's grotesquely contorted skull, where excess bone seems to have grown like tallow dripping from a horrible candle, or a foaming tumor of excess calcification.","popularity":0.6856,"poster_path":"/3Yxh4abFiTCxNUJj9H99ZtNOBtr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6548,"logo_path":"/rlm70Ypcfis5L6Q7MlWxhW7IbCy.png","name":"Paramount Home Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Terrible Elephant Man Revealed","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Elephant Man Revealed","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Sanger","original_name":"Jonathan Sanger","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/iMFHSjjyhRyIBqj8wxDaIb3aEzL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d323c751d78f20011e1c950","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Brooks","original_name":"Mel Brooks","popularity":1.5792,"profile_path":"/c21qNcMJlHnRolfhQhZOVacjtwI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d323c7e1d78f2000fe1c583","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hurt","original_name":"John Hurt","popularity":1.8848,"profile_path":"/bjNSzt1d7uK3q5PbtFXUJrRt4qg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d323c8d2f8d094522d71c0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Freddie Francis","original_name":"Freddie Francis","popularity":0.1906,"profile_path":"/oBX0GpsTwXPYtaCjj1sCQHUsJcF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d323c9d2f8d090010d8db01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529315,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Christopher Tucker","original_name":"Christopher Tucker","popularity":0.069,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d323cd96a300b2f7ea260fc","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1266715","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Yxh4abFiTCxNUJj9H99ZtNOBtr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
