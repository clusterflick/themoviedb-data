At 20 years of age, she had survived Auschwitz Birkenau, while 49 members of her family were murdered, including her mother, father, and little sister. Today, at age 90, Eva is asked to participate in a dance theatre performance about her life's journey. This would be her first experience performing on a stage. Reka, the director, imagines a duet between Eva and a young, internationally acclaimed dancer, Emese. Reka wants to see these two women, young and old, interact on stage, to see how their bodies, and stories, can intertwine. Eva agrees immediately. Three women - three months - a story of crossing boundaries. Whilst the extraordinary moments of Eva's life are distilled into theater scenes, a truly wonderful and powerful relationship forms among the three women.","popularity":0.2632,"poster_path":"/qXypwYMaLwvBbUfxAXBwK4xoUsz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2019-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Euphoria of Being","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva Pusztai-Fahidi","original_name":"Éva Pusztai-Fahidi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5de40dcaa7e36300146be162","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emese Cuhorka","original_name":"Emese Cuhorka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5de40dbaa7e36300166b6b09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Réka Szabó","original_name":"Réka Szabó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5de40ddd6782590018fe32f4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1749343,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claudia Kovács","original_name":"Claudia Kovács","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff6ad92fdec6007f276097","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Réka Szabó","original_name":"Réka Szabó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d30cee22f8d090010d48ea6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sylvie Gadmer","original_name":"Sylvie Gadmer","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/nZDPpR2m350RCLtLcSbK2cHFMM3.jpg","credit_id":"5de40e280cd4460012399dc2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207644,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Péter Sass","original_name":"Péter Sass","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de40e360cd4460019395f7f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439048,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Balázs Barna","original_name":"Balázs Barna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de40e040cd4460019395ea0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9313040","wikidata_id":"Q101091534","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMdec6BCnWGEoOMqgfruxIv3fDG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2857,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXypwYMaLwvBbUfxAXBwK4xoUsz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":2062,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ax7vVERzvYjlW9do9igx2VdUJTo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1548}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":10939,"name":"holocaust (shoah) survivor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Semaine de la Critique","release_date":"2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
