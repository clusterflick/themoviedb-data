Aboard his yacht bound for the South Seas, Sam pays more attention to his guests than to his wife, and she flees when he attempts to force liquor on her. A sudden paralytic stroke renders him helpless, and she believes him dead. A storm comes up, and Velma is washed ashore on a desert isle. She is later joined by Lieut. Paul Mack, whose hydroplane has run out of fuel. They fall in love, but their idyll is broken when they are captured by a band of moonshiners.","popularity":0.3192,"poster_path":"/xg6UBg8fG5xactd2xo5eSAA2US6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Torrent","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Novak","original_name":"Eva Novak","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/dvg9DEBHyXLixbwsaZlQi6IUsXN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Velma Patton","credit_id":"618db4277ac82900434f061e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elita Proctor Otis","original_name":"Elita Proctor Otis","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jM1lW3d3ikhOYP9mBlXcG0Y0Yf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anne Mayhew (as Oleta Ottis)","credit_id":"618db42dc9dbf90044f68b2c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Perrin","original_name":"Jack Perrin","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/iHon1YovaxeKZrLM7ouj1B4k1ng.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lt.
