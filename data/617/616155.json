With sweeping sets by John Macfarlane, Girard’s new production turns the Met stage into a rich, layered tableau reminiscent of a vast oil painting. Valery Gergiev conducts a brilliant cast led by bass-baritone Evgeny Nikitin as the Dutchman, with German soprano Anja Kampe making her anticipated Met debut as the devoted Senta, whose selfless love is what the Dutchman seeks. Bass Franz-Josef Selig is her father, Daland, and tenor Sergey Skorokhodov is her deserted former lover, Erik. This live cinema transmission is part of the Met’s award-winning Live in HD series, bringing opera to more than 2,200 theaters in more than 70 countries worldwide.","popularity":0.6845,"poster_path":"/5O10iZfth44XnzqL2dLq9gLA56H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: The Flying Dutchman","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz-Josef Selig","original_name":"Franz-Josef Selig","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/lHT4IYTVLbQiqud8TPI9ci2ssnm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Daland","credit_id":"5f1f715d4a222600355dc587","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Portillo","original_name":"David Portillo","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Steersman","credit_id":"5f1f716bc50ad20035ae9e40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniy Nikitin","original_name":"Евгений Никитин","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/4eAyuUaaU0fDhuLaKln8tuvxv74.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dutchman","credit_id":"5f1f71794a222600375ddf67","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mihoko Fujimura","original_name":"Mihoko Fujimura","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/m7mRqEMLT3uRDALadOsncDpmtpv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5f1f71834a222600375ddfb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1854452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Kampe","original_name":"Anja Kampe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/e62nPypcy4WVOXrrIQpDf2x7Ppg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Senta","credit_id":"5f1f718c4a222600365ddbad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Skorokhodov","original_name":"Sergei Skorokhodov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Erik","credit_id":"5f1f7197b4a5430034314f0d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff55cd25690b50041d88733","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valery Gergiev","original_name":"Valery Gergiev","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/gn4dLa8vF0fdONol4hiHstSfK40.jpg","credit_id":"5f1f71374a222600365dd864","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Halvorson","original_name":"Gary Halvorson","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/9KwJweL5GN0y5rvsvBhBRlVtmb0.jpg","credit_id":"5f1f71274a222600385dc5d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2070503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolyn Choa","original_name":"Carolyn Choa","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1f7144b4a5430034314c11","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Girard","original_name":"François Girard","popularity":0.2121,"profile_path":"/djxaEAgKaYS2MAzQm5B5yHZeCqr.jpg","credit_id":"5f5b68be7ad08c003955af0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"5f5e40e42b93200036df929e","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"5f5e40ee156cc70038d9bc1a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12986830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5O10iZfth44XnzqL2dLq9gLA56H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Der Fliegende Holländer: Excerpts","key":"5VfPK-0VV0o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-28T23:10:55.000Z","id":"6743a941100e4f4524fba1a7"}]}}}
