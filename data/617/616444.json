Ruby welcomes her impatient daughter with a home cooked lunch and a request: teach her to ride a bicycle. Sabrina begrudgingly obliges. Together mom and daughter struggle through a bicycle lesson that becomes increasingly humorous as personalities clash and frustrations mount.  But when Sabrina cuts the lesson short and returns the bicycle to the garage, she discovers a disturbing secret that her mother has kept from her. A secret that not only forces them to deal with their broken relationship but also has promise to bring them closer in a way that neither of them expected.","popularity":0.7808,"poster_path":"/5Zdo0gXoM1WAeonut2Rl0xPfCz4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37585,"logo_path":"/cfqg8AccZFCdhuwTjiIXB4ktnjB.png","name":"LoCo Motion
