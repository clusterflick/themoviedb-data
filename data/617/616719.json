A drunk is raving violently in the hallway. A post box frame is stuck on his arm. There is blood on the stairs. Black Hole Mama does not romanticize poverty. Some residents have clearly lost control over their own lives and consume alcohol in unhealthy amounts. Still, as the rascals and yobs tell their life stories, it is difficult not to be surprised and touched. The black and white imagery emphasizes the nostalgic yet timeless mood of the film. It is easy like a summer afternoon, sunny with just a hint of sadness.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/lN7ervpi97HiT4KeNaaSS8TFJ0x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Hole Mama","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Чёрная дыра","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heidi Piiroinen","original_name":"Heidi Piiroinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3195332f8d090010d703d5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kalle Sipilä","original_name":"Kalle Sipilä","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3195426a300b5922ac79a8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heidi Piiroinen","original_name":"Heidi Piiroinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d31953a6a300b5922ac7985","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Veli Laamanen","original_name":"Veli Laamanen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3195596a300b16aaa8a8fe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heidi Piiroinen","original_name":"Heidi Piiroinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d31952d6a300b16aaa8a87a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kalle Sipilä","original_name":"Kalle Sipilä","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d31954f6a300b16aaa8a8da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6399378","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tXHfNiuNXC4jLCtJR8Gh2JXuGQG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lN7ervpi97HiT4KeNaaSS8TFJ0x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docpoint Helsinki","release_date":"2017-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Rudnik International Debut Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BLACK HOLE MAMA TRAILER","key":"205977180","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-28T00:01:42.000Z","id":"5d3195a7caab6d1640a47b86"}]}}}
