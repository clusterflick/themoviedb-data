The lions, who occupied these previously wild spaces, are hunted by herd guards, or even slaughtered when they attack cows. Will and Lianne Steenkamp lived for two years in a territory occupied by a 17-year-old lioness - a \"queen\" -, her two daughters and their five lion cubs. This film traces the process of empowering the young: after learning to hunt alone, they will have to leave the family pack and find young females to reproduce. A necessity all the greater as their species seems threatened.","popularity":0.336,"poster_path":"/6qC0aq6hBPGYNpPBQXgmJfwqjG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lions of Namibia: The Kings of the Desert","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Desert Warriors: Lions of the Namib","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Vanishing Kings - Desert Lions of Namib","type":"Alternative"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2372292,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lianne Steenkamp","original_name":"Lianne Steenkamp","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/eoyFeg09bjpEwxMbos3Q6zcIajH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6450b1f2d7107e010adec63b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Will Steenkamp","original_name":"Will Steenkamp","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/mYPUjuIyqmqqxImvT2CLlXycfYz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6450b1f9d7107e00ebe04ac5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Will Steenkamp","original_name":"Will Steenkamp","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/mYPUjuIyqmqqxImvT2CLlXycfYz.jpg","credit_id":"6450b1feaf85de0104c0ad21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2372292,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lianne Steenkamp","original_name":"Lianne Steenkamp","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/eoyFeg09bjpEwxMbos3Q6zcIajH.jpg","credit_id":"6450b1eed7107e016b7de636","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fEV0dUz4Z0FH24shLKTYpMcs3yg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6qC0aq6hBPGYNpPBQXgmJfwqjG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2043,"name":"lion"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":299555,"name":"lions"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
