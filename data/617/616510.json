Work begins as a document about the successful public people, entrepreneurs and businessmen. Then it rests on the impossibility of the story from a professional point of view (production problems and the issue of professional fitness author), and gradually comes to a reflection above the difficulties of socialization of the young artist. Trying to apply existing criteria of success to their own practice, or to somehow borrow from outside the strategies of successful behavior, fails. The author manifests inability to meet his own needs, while remaining within the art system.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Intervyu","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2099727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Kachalyan","original_name":"Andrey Kachalyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fxTdR3OuDVOolMVPqlFoTKVoJCD.jpg","credit_id":"5d30697d2f8d094522d1eff8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2099727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Kachalyan","original_name":"Andrey Kachalyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fxTdR3OuDVOolMVPqlFoTKVoJCD.jpg","credit_id":"5d306985caab6d209995f6e5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pQZt37JlmtUcMc7jjzis6S5m2FV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mirror Andrey Tarkovsky International Film Festival","release_date":"2013-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"interview","key":"114384648","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-12-12T20:57:32.000Z","id":"5d3069eb6a300b16aaa544f0"}]}}}
