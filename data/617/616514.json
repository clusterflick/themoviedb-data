People who are no longer young warm up under the guidance of a strong, young fitness instructor against the background of the recently restored rotunda in Moscow’s Neskuchny Gardens. The instructor encourages them: «Breathe! You can do it!». They do their best to carry out all the exercises correctly, ready for the main event — a march, to the chant of «left, right, left, right!».","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Razminka","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2364742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Polina Kanis","original_name":"Polina Kanis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d306caecaab6d0b299ef889","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2364742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Polina Kanis","original_name":"Polina Kanis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d306cb32f8d094522d1f83c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lMHt7VjDT82MK1OYaW3rBf01LYj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Workout","key":"30123282","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2011-10-06T08:29:08.000Z","id":"5d306d316a300b5922a9276f"}]}}}
