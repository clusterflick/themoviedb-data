His four children, however, fell short once they grew up and had to fend for themselves. When Appleton dies, his widow (Lydia Knott) explains that his last request was that each child spend one hour of contemplation with his body. The first is the youngest daughter, Daisy (Rosemary Theby), an artist of note who was betrayed and left with a son to raise out of wedlock. Next is Luke (Milton Sills), a wild young man who ran away at 19, and even though he is now married and a father, he still can't quite settle down. The eldest son, Bob (Wilfred Lucas), is next -- he wed a wealthy woman, but the marriage has no love.","popularity":0.4387,"poster_path":"/7Ot0SnO7OBsKeybdrI7snZNYSwi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harry Garson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hushed Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winter Hall","original_name":"Winter Hall","popularity":0.1588,"profile_path":"/jDN707Y6PhbruDCGGHkvpuFSTmc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Judge Robert","credit_id":"61882788160e73009353cbbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Knott","original_name":"Lydia Knott","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/eKZxDbHYoY898QcfjggDNi78BvU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Appleton","credit_id":"618827987d41aa0043b6c784","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Lucas","original_name":"Wilfred Lucas","popularity":0.3261,"profile_path":"/rr70uPoMMtkHFYSPn0JTwI9ikQ9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Robert Appleton Jr.","credit_id":"618827a6fe63180027a3481a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Sweet","original_name":"Blanche Sweet","popularity":0.16,"profile_path":"/xlcBzlENawXKPIQnpORlUCNkHmj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Virginia Appleton Blodgett","credit_id":"618827b4e74146002b7815c0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Sills","original_name":"Milton Sills","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/eJTx8Tzq7wx9PwnuHm1cb27KSDx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Luke Appleton","credit_id":"618827c33faba000422b11c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Daisy Appleton","credit_id":"618827d2595a56006370620c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1302584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Hope","original_name":"Gloria Hope","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/aiNxjH8kqoC43KIt1yNYKFoPfhK.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Annie Vierge","credit_id":"618827e569d280002b43deea","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Northrup","original_name":"Harry Northrup","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/zTH4PU8BGipYly6JuV0BnYz3YX5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Buck Blodgett","credit_id":"618827f3fe631800648601f7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Anderson","original_name":"Mary Anderson","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/l6JFaDgrTE7rlrl3uXnKyWitPEP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Birdie Sankey","credit_id":"61882802e74146002b781641","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":540363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wyndham Standing","original_name":"Wyndham Standing","popularity":0.172,"profile_path":"/3J3ynqFyS6jkEKKs5TkCPKstfjm.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lord George Daw","credit_id":"61882811e74146004391c995","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Alexander","original_name":"Ben Alexander","popularity":0.2743,"profile_path":"/9rei98OSExqKecusqft2BV5KR1X.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Gondy","credit_id":"61882820e93e95002b43646e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Steers","original_name":"Larry Steers","popularity":0.1621,"profile_path":"/8QBHXihnGldVMNIxnbW2ljTk7Y1.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Milton (as L.T.
