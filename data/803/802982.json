Despite this, the two women still have a lot in common. In an internal monologue Mina gradually reveals more about her grandmother’s tragic story and unveils the secret of her mysterious death, which the family refuses to speak about even today. Until it becomes clear that generations of women face the same struggle and the fate of Mina and Nurijan is inextricably linked.
