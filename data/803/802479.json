Travel down to Colombia, and go behind the scenes of the Vallenato Kings Festival where, each April, the world's greatest accordionists assemble to perform, compete, and celebrate the squeezebox. Meet the players and hear their stories, including professors of the Turco Gil Academy, where over two thousand children dedicate themselves to their instrument, and Yeime, a young girl who overcame cultural stereotypes to become the first woman to win the competition in over forty years.","popularity":0.3716,"poster_path":"/h09Aiq25G2aeuD365v6MDbH8r23.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Accordian Kings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h09Aiq25G2aeuD365v6MDbH8r23.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6579,"name":"music festival"},{"id":277389,"name":"accordian"},{"id":277390,"name":"vallenato kings festival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
