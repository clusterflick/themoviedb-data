But it is mainly a film about life and choices. We follow, for a year, three ordinary lives, ready each day for something extraordinary, three guardian angels that fly on board a helicopter, simply to offer assistance. Over the noise of the emergency, the film narrates a radical choice, that of Silvia, an emergency intensive care anaesthetist, involving in every instance the thread of life, of waiting, of solitude.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/Xl2P4EHugxvS4Jh9W1J20e3VTE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Wire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Roero","original_name":"Silvia Roero","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gBnnkNQMaV8m0TMNGsxeXy8H0ki.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"603fa5f1a199a60026ae7775","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucio Trucco","original_name":"Lucio Trucco","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zkPoR8fClR29kziZKuGgmgP5ugy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"603fa5fa124c8d005996ead1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudi Janin","original_name":"Rudi Janin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/21HFoBp12dkC2LvR0UydqUChtaW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"603fa603a402c100449d7e96","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Péaquin","original_name":"Joseph Péaquin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/dzDr3RC1QrM8jyn1yar1pDcBcP4.jpg","credit_id":"603fa5d6719aeb006fcf49bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1063,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vw35oRDWhZ60R1XLaJtuKJqqstZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1890},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1063,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ipIiC2HbSRBQdlPZJRhSlfuzaaq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1890}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":811,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/Xl2P4EHugxvS4Jh9W1J20e3VTE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":541}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
