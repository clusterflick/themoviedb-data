Uses music and lyrics to describe struggles with mental health / finding hope. I collected lyrics for a couple months that I connected with and helped me understand and describe my struggles with mental health. Then I stitched them together in a poem of sorts. The poem as well as the imagery are jumpy and mimic what goes on in a spiral or panic attack (at least for me) as I move through.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hear Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clair Mooney","original_name":"Clair Mooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6040e1803a99370076907ff5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clair Mooney","original_name":"Clair Mooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040e1705be00e006e757679","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
