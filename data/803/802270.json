His effort is ludicrous because of the fact that his talent is all recruited from the help in the hotel. Roscoe, the cook, is forced to appear in a dress suit and when Al St. John appears from the bar there is a lively rivalry between the two for the applause of the crowd. Mabel, the waitress, vies with a professional dancer from the city. Into this setting comes William Jefferson, a polished sharper, who takes the innocent Mabel by storm.","popularity":0.2171,"poster_path":"/qfCTQ1VR1O67yrZMThbTmLeBrSo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Some Queen - and then some!\"","title":"Bright Lights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Bright Lights","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","original_name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","popularity":0.2092,"profile_path":"/p0pR1wMRfRfLWZfdHywQcqph8vp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fatty","credit_id":"603fe4e41065d30042ba38b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mabel","credit_id":"603fe4f3a1a9ba0070cf02a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Jefferson","original_name":"William Jefferson","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/c9XVC7p2vm6FiB9anyieZlfaPdt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The City Slicker","credit_id":"603fe50c66ae4d005a337106","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al St. John","original_name":"Al St. John","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/u6jepFCiItOjfo9wP3yU2ZLZFgE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Bartender","credit_id":"603fe51a66a0d3002b8c76da","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minta Durfee","original_name":"Minta Durfee","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/8QgdVcTIocr6xdnD0lxhOBPAfUs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"625efddb7fcab300a6aa1c7d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","original_name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","popularity":0.2092,"profile_path":"/p0pR1wMRfRfLWZfdHywQcqph8vp.jpg","credit_id":"603fe53966ae4d002a46b09e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0006468","wikidata_id":"Q4967448","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/123jw1uRcu9S71WGGUGcoaCplqD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qfCTQ1VR1O67yrZMThbTmLeBrSo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
