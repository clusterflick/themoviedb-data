She had been detained for a week pending imminent deportation though she had done nothing wrong. It was devastating, but luckily she was released before she was deported. Here we follow Wilson as she returns to Jamaica for the first time in 50 years, trying to make sense of her place in the world and rebuild a sense of security and belonging.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/m5h8Xf1wJpgh0aFPRj41oKwhWiV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Windrush","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m5h8Xf1wJpgh0aFPRj41oKwhWiV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
