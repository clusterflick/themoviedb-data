Preceded by Schoenbergs Accompaniment to a Cinematographic Scene, Op. 34, Zemlinskys Romantic score is full of psychological intrigue. Is Der Zwerg a critique of societys superficiality? Is it the composers self-portrait in his doomed affair with Alma Schindler? Director Tobias Kratzers stunning, transparent production creates a space in which each character is thrown into sharp relief in this fine, noble and melancholy work.","popularity":0.2107,"poster_path":"/fKuF1E2hGa5cA5C7xGQDjqXutFi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Zwerg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Tsallagova","original_name":"Elena Tsallagova","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Donna Clara, Infanta of Spain","credit_id":"6040ed51e6d3cc005a185f5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Magee","original_name":"Emily Magee","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/jwI0ElChJs6s3odt9mf4FNNgckR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ghita, her attendant","credit_id":"6040ed65cede69002c4cf796","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Butt Philip","original_name":"David Butt Philip","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Der Zwerg","credit_id":"6040ed7455c1f4004576b4b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2502132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Morris Mehnert","original_name":"Mick Morris Mehnert","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Der Zwerg (actor)","credit_id":"6040ed81cba36f005a7f07b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp Jekal","original_name":"Philipp Jekal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Don Estoban, the chamberlain","credit_id":"6040ed92992fe6004582db8d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flurina Stucki","original_name":"Flurina Stucki","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Maid","credit_id":"6040eda23a99370057239050","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Fasquelle","original_name":"Amber Fasquelle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Maid","credit_id":"6040eda95be00e005ade905f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maliu Vaahtoluoto","original_name":"Maliu Vaahtoluoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Maid","credit_id":"6040edb4db70580077727604","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"So Young Park","original_name":"So Young Park","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Companion","credit_id":"6040edc5e6d3cc005a186020","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Häger","original_name":"Kristina Häger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Companion","credit_id":"6040edcbdb70580058304c33","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338172,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Donald Runnicles","original_name":"Donald Runnicles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040eddd5690b50045d4c61e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998139,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander von Zemlinsky","original_name":"Alexander von Zemlinsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040edff5690b5002af2b56b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Kratzer","original_name":"Tobias Kratzer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040ee0cdb70580023e0be5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vk0QybYd55RPArgB9TOUueHYp31.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fKuF1E2hGa5cA5C7xGQDjqXutFi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
