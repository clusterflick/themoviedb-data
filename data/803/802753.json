Neither an opera nor an operetta, it was a work that did not fit into any of the pre-defined categories. On the 100th anniversary of the composer's death in 1999, the Zurich opera house presented a new production, the work's Swiss premiere. This production picked up on various impulses from the history of the works origin, using them to create a unique version of the piece. Here, for example, is the \"Donauweibchen\" incorporated shortly before the end. The Austrian-born chief conductor of the Zurich opera house, Franz Welser-Möst, has left his mark as a native speaker on this \"Simplicius\" production both here and elsewhere.","popularity":0.2027,"poster_path":"/kEX42KoWIzBuCHFqE0EeXAYJQ51.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johann Strauss: Simplicius","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Volle","original_name":"Michael Volle","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/mjmUSpJDdnD9qwEUKdpRkVFay8O.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6042237ddb705800792d6efc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Zysset","original_name":"Martin Zysset","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60422384d3719700789bf314","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Haunstein","original_name":"Rolf Haunstein","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6042238c96670e006d96f4fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Magnuson","original_name":"Elizabeth Magnuson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60422399d3719700789bf329","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Beczała","original_name":"Piotr Beczała","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/zeDKPo64Fzl1Jr3eLLcU9hgeWoO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"604223a0d1ca2a002aa7c267","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Welser-Möst","original_name":"Franz Welser-Möst","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604223b222df2e002aee118e","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2300082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Pountney","original_name":"David Pountney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cKXLBIhjdIVMlzY65f3UZ77gsjo.jpg","credit_id":"604223da9a358d00459c40af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kEX42KoWIzBuCHFqE0EeXAYJQ51.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
