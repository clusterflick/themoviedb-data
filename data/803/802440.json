The play begins with an argument over what to eat for breakfast, then turns into a generational clash over race, opportunity and a decision that Calvin made years ago. Donaldâ€™s grumpiness is peppered with disturbing outbursts, revealing bits of his past, informed by growing up Black and poor in the South.","popularity":0.6129,"poster_path":"/RS6rANVhMf2dkAOTNzi5SBzksX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Old Black Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendell Pierce","original_name":"Wendell Pierce","popularity":1.3959,"profile_path":"/uOsldo9Pkl0E79UbIXX5tZZmC8F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Calvin Jones","credit_id":"6041d4d5c525c40042a9a852","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Robinson","original_name":"Charles Robinson","popularity":0.5573,"profile_path":"/zEy4ZnzuhhyueT5bef1jzQUFW7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donald Jones","credit_id":"6041d58b651fcf006e5d5374","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":260933,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Cacaci","original_name":"Joe Cacaci","popularity":0.1294,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6041d5c77cffda0045f71672","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2999105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Anthony Tyler","original_name":"James Anthony Tyler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6041d6f1651fcf00448fa582","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":980,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iyFO9RavY6O5kVoiV5uA2O6fMSo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1742}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/RS6rANVhMf2dkAOTNzi5SBzksX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
