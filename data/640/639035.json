Albani is ballet dancer Viola Suroff, who’s put her career aside to look after her partner Maxim Sadi, a baritone with unspecified health issues that have kept him off stage. Stroganoff sets his sights on Viola and offers her a job in the corps de ballet for his new opera The Boyar, which she accepts provided Maxim is also hired. However, dancer Margot (called Myrra in the French version) maintains a seething passion for Stroganoff, as does Countess Geschow (called Countess Ziska on this print), both of whom are resentful when watching his interactions with Viola. Jealousies run high on opening night between all the characters and Stroganoff is shot mid-performance, but who is the killer: Maxim, Margot, or Geschow?I","popularity":0.1776,"poster_path":"/evJLaWYZQYrOzUaBj0d7rY9s964.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seymour Nebenzal Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1928-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Performance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Theatre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1329792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcella Albani","original_name":"Marcella Albani","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/nMWYdeG23mFhgrVZApqY7WLqUHM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Viola Suroff","credit_id":"5da30a24d940350015635e04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich George","original_name":"Heinrich George","popularity":0.157,"profile_path":"/pG7HbJEVnG44wOL1kgaeTVZbzL7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Boris Stroganoff","credit_id":"5da30a3db84f9400139b7167","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":322397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Bradin","original_name":"Jean Bradin","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/gBxUUX2Ms8atFrgp6ZuzWCiLjH5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maxim Sad","credit_id":"5da30a57afe2240018eb909a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1269618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evi Eva","original_name":"Evi Eva","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/5zdrIYbkx8UwtTlc2yVsOtXFqWR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Margot (Myra)","credit_id":"5da30a79d940350015635e7b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sig Arno","original_name":"Sig Arno","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/tVPZ1OaiplPoc9ODahkIuFp9mcO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e6306983e01ea0013e9142f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2431543,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur bredow","original_name":"Arthur bredow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da30af1b84f9400159b9063","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2431542,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Günter Krampf","original_name":"Günter Krampf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da30adaafe2240013ebccb9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Curt J.
