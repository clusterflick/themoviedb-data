This film tells about the life of Tomasi and his German-Baltic wife Alexandra von Wolff-Stomersee – their unusual love story. The chaos of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and World War II forced Alexandra to leave St. Petersburg and later on – the family's castle in Stāmeriena, Latvia. During the war, in 1943, she fled to her husband in Palermo, where she would live until the day she died.","popularity":0.2294,"poster_path":"/394tSTVmaNPLa39sOUXh2ZUNUkF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kick Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":79143,"logo_path":"/qIa22fhd6RWz6zTDCgVAN6U0u7J.png","name":"Mistrus Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Birth of the Leopard","video":false,"vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Geparda dzimšana","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15460,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luigi Falorni","original_name":"Luigi Falorni","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da38932cb308400169270af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604659,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kārlis Auzāns","original_name":"Kārlis Auzāns","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/fMlOa8ag3OTan5azmwxrHXhBQqT.jpg","credit_id":"5fbad73d9a64c1004195c92c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","original_name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbad71c9f51af003ed4b69f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gints Grūbe","original_name":"Gints Grūbe","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/6GGLvVF0lsMjs8RsW6PR9S16eaR.jpg","credit_id":"5fbad701ca4f67003f742b14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1638409,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jörg Bundschuh","original_name":"Jörg Bundschuh","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbad6e6a2d2e9003f8dd25c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11658446","wikidata_id":"Q84752862","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/394tSTVmaNPLa39sOUXh2ZUNUkF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJazMrLNWIZ1GKpJO08dBjDapRN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":512},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/hhiVWzvwtnbEOqrVUB7YvqG0m0O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2020-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Rome Film Fest)","release_date":"2019-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Birth of the Leopard","key":"365756881","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-11T12:50:36.000Z","id":"6010aabf9a6435003f9513d8"}]}}}
