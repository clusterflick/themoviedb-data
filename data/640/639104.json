He lives in a humble neighborhood where manhood and violence go hand-in-hand. One day, as he jokes around with his friends out on the street, his words are mistaken for an insult by the local gangster. Events escalate when tit-for-tat violence ensues. The Amman districtâ€™s compacted hills, streets, and alleys tell the story of how fragile safety and stability can be in the shadows of anger and revenge.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/zns5vL4H55fG2wP6NU7ajgCV0Vd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freekeh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1528153,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bassel Ghandour","original_name":"Bassel Ghandour","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da378b71967570013ab5c5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10832066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zns5vL4H55fG2wP6NU7ajgCV0Vd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
