This silence was the result of the Mexican Government's refusal to ratify the San Andres Accords and the extensive military build-up in the Zapatista communities that began in 1995. The Silence of the Zapatistas documents the many non-violent protests organized by the Zapatista communities during this silence against the military presence in the Autonomous Municipality of San Pedro Michoacan.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/79QfON8pqtHbtVha3SMCKJlnil2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silence of the Zapatistas","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paco","original_name":"Paco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65721232b0460500e39499a0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paco","original_name":"Paco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da6f99b38765100145ed552","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paco","original_name":"Paco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07e10f9475b003fc87b47","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871594,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pablo","original_name":"Pablo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07e1a0c4c16003df6d6c7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871595,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marbin","original_name":"Marbin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07e276bdec3003b269f06","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871597,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Saul","original_name":"Saul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07e32271ca50040572861","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fredy","original_name":"Fredy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07e3d0c4c160040f67d9e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871600,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paco Vazquez","original_name":"Paco Vazquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07e83489d00003ecd0cd1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871602,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kerry Appel","original_name":"Kerry Appel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07ef8c613ce00417eb481","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871603,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"jesus Ramírez","original_name":"jesus Ramírez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc07f120c4c16003df6d7ef","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carlos E.
