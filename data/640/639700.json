They acquire their official gender assignment after going through what is known as “completion.” Rain, a young student on a field trip to an aquarium, envies that the rare fish she encounters have the ability to decide with whom to mate in spite of their specific gender. This is a privilege Rain doesn’t have, preventing her from returning any affection her classmate Sky gives her.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nqInZSoMU4eJiYZ6M0jD02xyKfo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Spallino","original_name":"Alessandro Spallino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da6592b47721500185e55d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6105164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqInZSoMU4eJiYZ6M0jD02xyKfo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":696}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
