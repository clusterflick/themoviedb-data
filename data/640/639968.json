The shadows of the past soon overwhelm her, but life in prison transformed Valya into a determined fighter for the love she has for Paz, a young Peruvian woman from Cuzco, who during Valya's incarceration felt compelled into a fictitious marriage of convenience to calm the punishing waters swirling around the presence of the supposed demon Valya in Paz' ultraconservative family. Only Andean magic can help the two lovers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1oNfzdHgYnk5R21j4kk6zQv0fRK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Ortiz","original_name":"Sonia Ortiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da7a11aa24232001279e20e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6848654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1oNfzdHgYnk5R21j4kk6zQv0fRK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
