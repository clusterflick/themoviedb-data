The visual and narrative structure of the film imagines a reversal and transitions of perspective between sound and image, where the natural world is “Shown” mainly through the reverberation of sounds produced in a state of suspension and surprise. An initiatory path, started through the subtraction of “Visible Frames” (primary elements), which transformed the absence of information into an opportunity for creating intimacy in a new emotional perception and creative space.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stuck in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2432916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Massimo Saverio Maida","original_name":"Massimo Saverio Maida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da595a5e860170012b40ccc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5895640","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
