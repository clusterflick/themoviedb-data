One morning Mary discovers a burst pipe under the kitchen sink. Rather than dealing to the problem, the family ignore the leak, preferring to follow their banal daily lives, including their anticipation of a rugby game versus France that night.  The leak continues and slowly the house floods. A black comedy of surreal proportions, Water is a film about procrastination, denial and global warming. How one small problem, when ignored, can lead to disastrous consequences.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2432026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Graham","original_name":"Chris Graham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da3d25c1967570013ac03b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0389526","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
