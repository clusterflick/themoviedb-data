The affable Burbeck is due to inherit his uncle’s fortune provided he’s married by November; if not, the inheritance will go to his cousin Howard Curtis. An adventuress, Beatrice Gaden, and her husband Dick are in cahoots with Curtis: Beatrice pretends to be single in order to string Norton along up to the November date, at which time Curtis will come into the money and give a share to his unscrupulous partners.","popularity":0.211,"poster_path":"/gtBinZl10Ys53emgw0sOdrLLhQh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wife by Proxy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1656698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Taliaferro","original_name":"Mabel Taliaferro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/oBjBpaPbdqlsrFHlHGBJLoMJEOu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jerry McNairne","credit_id":"5da30738d9403500136354af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4523914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Walker","original_name":"Bob Walker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Norton Burbeck","credit_id":"65c3dcbecffeed016351858b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Crute","original_name":"Sally Crute","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/j4EAUflh93T6hlZV0eSvTS2XFtx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Beatrice Gaden","credit_id":"5da3079db84f9400189b5e00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Jones","original_name":"Fred Jones","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Frederick Gaden","credit_id":"62963471f8e9820067ec493e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yale Benner","original_name":"Yale Benner","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/4egbM9P2W3O4YLe2XWFbHSY1Mma.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Howard Curtis","credit_id":"62963482ca83541353b2ba86","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1729583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George D.
