In 2003, 70 year old Charlie Sorland is conditionally released from death row for good behaviour and societal contributions after serving 50 years for serial murders. With a news story on his release and his dedication to deter others from violence, impressionable Jason Lutra sees the story and takes an unhealthy interest in Charlie which leads to Jason emulating Charlie's past. As new murders begin to occur by way of Charlie's old m.o., Detective Brent Lowe takes notice of the similarities and employs Charlie's help in getting into the mind of his own copycat killer with promises of a full pardon for the catch.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/mNzxiRB1h1YWLTZAR6mgNyBGIsq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emulator","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9391986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mNzxiRB1h1YWLTZAR6mgNyBGIsq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
