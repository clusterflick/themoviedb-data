The 60-minute documentary sheds light on Ives' life and work in all its facets and inconsistencies. American singer and composer Frank Zappa included Charles Ives in a list of influences that he presented in the liner notes of his debut album Freak Out! (1966). Ives continues to influence contemporary composers, arrangers and musicians. Planet Arts Records released Mists: Charles Ives for Jazz Orchestra. Ives befriended and encouraged a young Elliott Carter. In addition, Phil Lesh, bassist of the Grateful Dead, has described Ives as one of his two musical heroes.","popularity":0.43,"poster_path":"/n3cBzAcmJRWH30hkWOq18Kv5RrX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unanswered Ives: American Pioneer of Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142387,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Adams","original_name":"John Adams","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/jWSg6LhA7ZLv15ipUgVlOH0wh94.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5e79c4ddc8a2d4001323cd80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Arnold","original_name":"Frank Arnold","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Charles Ives (voice)","credit_id":"5da2f0e8b84f9400189b15b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark D.
