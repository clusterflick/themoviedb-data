Under-privileged and oppressed, Chu almost consistently runs into conflicts with the merciless law enforcers, as well as the blood-thirsty press. The film also depicts her bonding with two other persons: a 10-year-old AD/HD kid and Ling, her long-time crippled mate whom everyone believes to be her husband but what lies behind is a Platonic relationship of secret intimacy and loving care. Chu’s story also affects the young soul of the ambitious and fame-driven reporter, Heidi.","popularity":0.1195,"poster_path":"/szr4Kre7URRImcNPPDSV7tSseoU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69437,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Cool Pictures","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"A Life of Papers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kara Wai Ying-Hung","original_name":"惠英紅","popularity":1.2808,"profile_path":"/6OV9kM62Y7M7EswtkpCThs0QAxg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5994147ad08c0037512500","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ren Xia","original_name":"Ren Xia","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5994532b93200039d939c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/szr4Kre7URRImcNPPDSV7tSseoU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1136}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
