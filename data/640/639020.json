Princess Maria (Elena Sangro) is married to the Duke of Helgoland (Ugo Bazzini), the leader of an anti-government plot about to be exposed by their house guest Count Giorgio (Carlo Gualandri). Giorgio tries to involve Maria, and in his fatal fight with Helgoland, her husband is killed using the knife that Maria hands to Giorgio. Forced to flee, they meet up again in Rome, where Maria has changed her name to Myriam and Giorgio has become a monk. Giorgio still desires Myriam, who rejects his advances, and she convinces her suitor Donatello (Giorgio Fini) to kill him.","popularity":0.2078,"poster_path":"/t5ctq5iqQAmlUuOJB6BxVfH3y3A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Celio Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1920-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marble Faun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Faune de marbre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1057591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Sangro","original_name":"Elena Sangro","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/mgMq6V5nZwyfACZOMNXkmm3AQ2C.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"S.A.R. la principessa Maria dello Jutland/H.R.H.
