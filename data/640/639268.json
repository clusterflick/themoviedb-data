Emulsion Connection connects photochemical and digital format, and also connects filmmaker’s reinterpretation of the carefree student life in abroad and the return to life in hometown Taiwan. These images links represent that the photochemical ways of completing images could be seen as a non-breaking time collector; the time difference between each frame can be 1/24 second or a decade.
