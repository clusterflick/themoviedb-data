Rembert, who lived on a plantation, joined the civil rights movement as a teen and was put to work on a chain gang, is a rare survivor of a lynching attempt. Decades later, he still carries the scars. “That lynching is on my back, and it’s dragging me down, even today,” he says. As he etches the history, bloodsoaked and cruel, into leatherwork, fellow artist Dr. Shirley Jackson Whitaker organizes a different kind of ceremony to search for healing. “It’s not just black history,” she says. “This is American history.”","popularity":0.138,"poster_path":"/nBsoWZqu7krf0wpvUZCvtv7diop.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128976,"logo_path":"/6ZfJiskmTdzvYs8861ynrFNMSzk.png","name":"XTR","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashes to Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2433381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winfred Rembert","original_name":"Winfred Rembert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5da623a638765100145d6589","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2433376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Rees","original_name":"Taylor Rees","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/yqRAxnGY8y6Piq5BxV2SUDiY0h9.jpg","credit_id":"5da6237247721500135e1096","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renan Öztürk","original_name":"Renan Öztürk","popularity":0.1096,"profile_path":"/8n6t81MDM1CGmdACuqDV6AtjJFV.jpg","credit_id":"5f7a632c7b7b4d003977ef97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1478991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Allison Davis","original_name":"Allison Davis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a6346d5ffcb0035a2a12c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2433376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Rees","original_name":"Taylor Rees","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/yqRAxnGY8y6Piq5BxV2SUDiY0h9.jpg","credit_id":"5f7a635e9a64350039b52b3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803639,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Todd Rees","original_name":"Todd Rees","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a636b8741c4003a70dd83","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2371313,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Logan Nelson","original_name":"Logan Nelson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mjevNuwn5MeMLzSVXPFzvclsYfU.jpg","credit_id":"5f7a63788741c400396eda86","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renan Öztürk","original_name":"Renan Öztürk","popularity":0.1096,"profile_path":"/8n6t81MDM1CGmdACuqDV6AtjJFV.jpg","credit_id":"5f7a6384d5ffcb0035a2a1f5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Peeler","original_name":"Joe Peeler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a63a143cd5400344d06bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nBsoWZqu7krf0wpvUZCvtv7diop.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Mountainfilm","release_date":"2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
