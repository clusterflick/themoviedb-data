Upon arriving Annie told John she started to have vivid flashbacks after watching the movie, \"Letters from Iwo Jima,\" that was shown during a local hospice movie event at her facility. She told John she wanted to read the letters and share the Lombardo memories with him before these flashbacks go away. This was Annie's dying wish. The legacy of Vic Lombardo, Pat Lombardo, Tony Lombardo, and John Lombardo must be told. This is the untold story of the Lombardo Family Letters.","popularity":0.1958,"poster_path":"/wFUY6ZYWAblTIZ1Fhu2JzORmeKj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters for Annie: Memories from World War II","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1942140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Sterner","original_name":"Ted Sterner","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Drunk Lawyer","credit_id":"5fc9c45341aac4004172149b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Fury","original_name":"Tommy Fury","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tony Lombardo","credit_id":"5fc9c469a5743d0041032744","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1799730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yefim Somin","original_name":"Yefim Somin","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/9sl2y86YCoGAPPKzaVrYGX7CxZx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pat Lombardo","credit_id":"5fc9c4793f8ede004001fa96","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1688996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Stapinski","original_name":"Stephen Stapinski","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/ruujTPaP3WEZawuwQvG8lKqIEGa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tony Lombardo","credit_id":"5fc9c49cb7fbbd003e3903c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2771901,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mathew Morin","original_name":"Mathew Morin","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"5fc9c4ad680be8003d182917","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2931437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Francine","original_name":"Danielle Francine","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/22zOvp6Huok2IzntpbU825zFoXV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Natalie Lombardo","credit_id":"5ffbb020706e56003e44ba13","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3671414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore DelGreco","original_name":"Salvatore DelGreco","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/pSd0wba0d7G0XV0mbhaB60BWYYd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lt.
