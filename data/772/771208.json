The film tells the story of two former circus performers who meet years later inside a shared memory, where they try to discover what sent them off in different directions from a love that seemed so total and so complete. It is an attempt at cinematic poetry, with music, poetic language, and resonant imagery meeting non-linear storytelling. Meg & Siggy Go Swimming features Porscha Shaw in the role of Meg. It was written and directed by Jeffrey Fracé, shot and edited by Kwame Braun, with music by Christian Frederickson.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/afTr08P7qwu5oDpDJf9Nmp8mLwU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meg & Siggy Go Swimming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2879604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Fracé","original_name":"Jeffrey Fracé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc86b492811a10040a0827a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368091,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Frederickson","original_name":"Christian Frederickson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc86b80426ae8004271b04e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kwame Braun","original_name":"Kwame Braun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc86b6b383df2003c56512e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2862,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/afTr08P7qwu5oDpDJf9Nmp8mLwU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1908}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
