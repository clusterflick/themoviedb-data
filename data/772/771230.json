The Finnish pavilion was closed when the footage was shot because of a fallen tree. Was it a sign? The sinking city echoes The Artist's current sense of resignation. The piece shifts from video footage into cartoons with speech bubbles, perhaps in an effort to reclaim the voiceover from a romanticising of ennui that seemed to be setting in. Is this a new beginning? Liberated from its ambitions for an illustrious career, art has now become a more metaphysical means of survival.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/omnL8OKb6mNUSLVcSCpHzH5RgRG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"None of the World's Futures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anni Puolakka","original_name":"Anni Puolakka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc87fb28261ee00413c3e9c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaakko Pallasvuo","original_name":"Jaakko Pallasvuo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc87f902811a1003ea0ba02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1701,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omnL8OKb6mNUSLVcSCpHzH5RgRG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1134}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
