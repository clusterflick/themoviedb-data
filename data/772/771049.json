The scenes that were made in a pseudo-documentary manner of the rebellious 1970’s remind of medieval Pieta exalting self-sacrificingness, pain, suffering and religious ecstasy. Richard ‘Hell’ Meyers, one of the representatives of the rock culture of the 70’s, came up with a term of ‘blank generation’ (the term may evidently be interpreted as a ‘lost generation’) to describe himself and his friends and thus advanced a philosophy of people seeking self-destruction. They get involved in meaningless and deadly situations to find a justification for living their lives. The film represents a story about wounded young men, who find themselves on an island and meet there a girl sailing the seas in a military launch, as a metaphor for an attempt to save the ‘blank/lost’ generation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7TJRqmZ5K1zrPRLVdi93k0XnU4b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Kolybel'naya","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galina Myznikova","original_name":"Galina Myznikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/35z4smRVEurC4ZzRhFqRpvWISRl.jpg","credit_id":"5fc7d3c9b84f9400400f124a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Provorov","original_name":"Sergey Provorov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc7d3d855c1f4003e5fb3e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6573162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7TJRqmZ5K1zrPRLVdi93k0XnU4b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
