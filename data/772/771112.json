Connected in time trought the layers of rituals, nature, death and fragments of remembrance, a narrator searchs for her and a lost artwork and finds nothing more then pieces of a broken memory. The film revolves around Ana Mendieta, deals with the question of body, spirtuality, fleeing and belonging and relates to political realities. A connected track, a time loop, between the death of an artist and the question of death and losing within the historical and present politics. A Film in search for the traces of baffling death.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6J94Y0wiFIGtW6NMiJ9HjB3m5kI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A subsequent fulfillment of a pre-historic wish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Gierlinger","original_name":"Johannes Gierlinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ahP8IF80BCTvJx9Z1HL2Hit5It5.jpg","credit_id":"5fc80aa621c4ca003f218ce1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5533516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6J94Y0wiFIGtW6NMiJ9HjB3m5kI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
