It is a poetic exploration of the Mediterranean and its immense riches, undermined by the irresponsible activity of man. More than a simple animal documentary, this film seeks to raise awareness of the need to preserve this sea, which is also our future. Like an ode to life, this documentary takes us on a discovery of fascinating biodiversity.","popularity":0.0532,"poster_path":"/aTe6LBUHdPSEBdAl4PrSD0ljUsB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57036,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMDA Production","origin_country":""},{"id":149139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poisson-Lune Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mediterranean Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Mediterranean Sea","type":"International Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Η Μεσόγειος","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cécile Andrée","original_name":"Cécile Andrée","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6025f4619979d20040ea10a6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2550100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Espla","original_name":"Jérôme Espla","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025f4199979d20040ea0fbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2550100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Espla","original_name":"Jérôme Espla","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025f4238b959e003d20faea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974355,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arnaud Gobin","original_name":"Arnaud Gobin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025f433af58cb003da594dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Samuel Mortain","original_name":"Samuel Mortain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025f451dcf875003f39a81f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1745395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérôme Alexandre","original_name":"Jérôme Alexandre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025f46ed2c0c1003c9e1273","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974359,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stéphane Panunzi","original_name":"Stéphane Panunzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025f47bdcf875003f39a895","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJnNPPnE7MqidwydQI4FLTVmdAv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sk","file_path":"/97Tb8kJU0fgj4pivfjXF0Ns2p94.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/aTe6LBUHdPSEBdAl4PrSD0ljUsB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
