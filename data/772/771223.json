Many shaky doors swing shut, to be quickly replaced by others. Pressure and suction emerge spontaneously from the rooms in front of the observer's eyes. In the mundane: table legs, the dark tobacco end of a cigarette. The film brings life into being and ushers in light.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o48j1MZr2LgGepJhwLl0hiiaORB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I/68 Dinge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"5fc87a37ecbde9003e9fdc90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o48j1MZr2LgGepJhwLl0hiiaORB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
