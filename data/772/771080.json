It takes him and a team of elite technical divers more than 20 miles off Milwaukee where they discover the wreck of one of Lake Michigans lost queens. It takes them to the remote waters of Lake Superior where they risk their lives to determine the identity of yet another lost ship. And it takes us into the forgotten life of a brave and stubborn woman who lived, and died, on these wild waters. Whether her presence cursed these lost ships, or a more earthly explanation can be found, the Great Lakes reputation as a graveyard for mariners stands firm.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Ships Of Great Lakes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1912811","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
