As he dresses to go out he stoops over to fix his shoe and, horrors! He tears his trousers. Where? Well, in a most embarrassing place. He fixes them hurriedly, trusting to have his coat tails cover it, but alas, the coat is too short for this purpose. Nevertheless, he takes a chance and, arriving at the house has the butler make a close inspection. He seems to be all right and enters, but when he bows to his hostess he hears the sickening sound of tearing cloth and knows that his patch has given way. Max hastily seats himself and during the rest of the evening performs the most astounding feats to hide his terrible secret.","popularity":0.1346,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max manque un riche mariage","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shame on Max","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Max","credit_id":"5fc98b9b680be8003f183d01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Lange","original_name":"Gabrielle Lange","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/4U53R7i1sLwDDf3vXUX8itw9bPP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc98bb05f4b730041e689a2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucien Nonguet","original_name":"Lucien Nonguet","popularity":0.0677,"profile_path":"/avsz3vRmL5yYlYcTPaaCP9v2ewa.jpg","credit_id":"5fc98b7f3f8ede003f020b3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","credit_id":"5fc98b92a5743d004002ff7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277874","wikidata_id":"Q49581859","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Max manque un riche mariage (1910) Shame on Max (Pathé)","key":"ogWDnLK7Vz4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-22T22:12:23.000Z","id":"674769b3301fb4f6b617afdc"}]}}}
