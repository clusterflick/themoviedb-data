The first Daugavgrīva regiment, the second Riga, third Kurland, fifth Semigallian, sixth Tukums, seventh Bauska and eighth Valmiera regiments of Latvian Riflemen – this was Latvia before its statehood. The film is a historically chronological study beginning with the formation of the Riflemen battalions and their first battles until the end of the Civil War in Russia, when a large part of the Riflemen returned home to the recently established state of Latvia. This is a story about common people challenged by the Big Epoch that determined their lives.","popularity":0.1087,"poster_path":"/5iCZ4cdKQtGOddcv4ZgdAAs2FyZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studija Centrums","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2017-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eight Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5fc8397b68188800411e1810","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5fc8398a426ae80043714352","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5fc8399f383df2003f560639","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5fc839da680be8003d162e23","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dainis Īvāns","original_name":"Dainis Īvāns","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/aKBNGjaP5mrW72CWnMkV0vtB1cr.jpg","credit_id":"5fc839f768188800401e257f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","original_name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lO5h9sKfSwnzQ4V4FdVhBqZr7aF.jpg","credit_id":"5fc83a113f8ede0040ffe6c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596260,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jānis Brunovskis","original_name":"Jānis Brunovskis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc83a22ecbde9003f9f57d2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596260,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jānis Brunovskis","original_name":"Jānis Brunovskis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc83a2e3f8ede0040ffe82d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2879473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruno Aščuks","original_name":"Bruno Aščuks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc83a40b2681f003f92993d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9220964","wikidata_id":"Q50070889","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5iCZ4cdKQtGOddcv4ZgdAAs2FyZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cj80L82Fz47iaCKGQXqVkCeABLH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Astoņas Zvaigznes.Treileris","key":"261311225","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-22T14:01:11.000Z","id":"6010b4e8d55c3d003f752707"}]}}}
