Through never-before-seen photo and video archives spanning two decades - including concert performances, backstage moments and intimate interviews - this film follows the epic journey of Eugene Hütz, Gogol frontman and one of the greatest storytellers of our time. A Romani born in Ukraine, Hütz fled his homeland during the Chernobyl disaster. Now, after years of exorcising demons through his music, he is going home to face down the biggest demon of all. A wild punk-rock-doc that explodes off the screen, Scream of My Blood is a testament to the power of speaking your truth, no matter the
