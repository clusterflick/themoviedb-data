In his version for the Ballett Zurich, Christian Spuck revives the classic in his own artistic style. With a great deal of humor, he addresses the complex process of growing up, relating themes such as generational conflicts with one’s parents, the difficulties of becoming a mature adult, and, last but not least, love and sexuality. Whenever possible, he frees the characters from their traditional role cliches. Petipa’s original version becomes a model that Christian Spuck occasionally cites yet repeatedly questions and counteracts with irony and occasionally irritating moments.","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":"/gcDSCzx3Q6wvbgqSBHs5RgoA2qQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus
