Almost everyone can quote at least a line or two from \"The Prettiest Girl in the Kindergarten\", \"Closed Kindergarten\", \"Lightning and Thunder\", and \"How is a Song Born\"; Or close your eyes and see in your mind's eye the painted windows in the series \"And This Kid\", in which Yehuda Atlas told us in honest and touching verses, what the world of a child really looks like.  Through interviews with Yehonatan Geffen, Yehuda Atlas, Yoni Rechter, Chava Alberstein, Matti Caspi and others, the film brings the untold story of the creation of the children's songs we grew up with. Along with the interviews, home movies and archive materials are shown, and the viewer embarks on a musical journey to the early days of the \"me\" generation.","popularity":0.0686,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2015-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Most of All, I Love Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1260680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chava Alberstein","original_name":"Chava Alberstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6454fb3787a27a00e3903c00","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehonatan Geffen","original_name":"Yehonatan Geffen","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6454fb4733ad8f00e3c966ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1764102,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matti Caspi","original_name":"Matti Caspi","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6454fb50d48cee0153ee0d17","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoni Rechter","original_name":"Yoni Rechter","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":"/z00CzAtElwpK92I1zRr2TTvg51F.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6454fb5687a27a015432dfcb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4046185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Shinan","original_name":"Tom Shinan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6454fb79c044290122cca3ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
