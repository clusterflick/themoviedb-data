Bruce Hornsby and Vince Welnick’s presence and musical contributions reinvigorated and revitalized the Grateful Dead, and the inspiration of the Dead's playing was palpable. On a Saturday night in front of 60,000 fans, the Dead played what is often considered one of the greatest shows of the Bruce-Vince era, up there with the second Giants Stadium show from a few days earlier. The Soldier field show was filled with favorites, including “Shakedown Street,”“Brown-Eyed Women,” “Playing In The Band,” “Terrapin Station,” and “Dark Star.” From the original six-camera video feed that appeared on the stadium's big screens and the pristine soundboard audio, Chicago 6/22/91 is an incredible performance start-to-finish.","popularity":0.3868,"poster_path":"/wHJzKJ8zYZSqiFCZknb8tGFf7oR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grateful Dead Meet-Up At The Movies 2023","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Garcia","original_name":"Jerry Garcia","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/6jAKLIekOs6FFcc783PZ1pb8soe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64923662b7b69d00e0188685","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Weir","original_name":"Bob Weir","popularity":0.1945,"profile_path":"/4yYZUCBEeptckOHLusV1TEPJDy3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64923685b77d4b0144bbc773","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1034,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wHJzKJ8zYZSqiFCZknb8tGFf7oR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
