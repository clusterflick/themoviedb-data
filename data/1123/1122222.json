At one point, the camera follows him as he ping-pongs across New York attending multiple concerts in one evening. His love for the work of putting on a show shines through as he drags the filmmakers through crowds and backstage so he can chat with artists and crew members. Interspersed with these present-day adventures are looks back on the highlights of Delsener’s career, reflecting his own intense nostalgia. It’s rare that a documentary so completely embodies the personality of its subject.","popularity":1.0709,"poster_path":"/pn4fnc3TGNTlaMwhPU5IDdsu2p7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89394,"logo_path":"/m1Hku3PhgdsQiPO8uVe7szyrxAb.png","name":"RadicalMedia","origin_country":"US"},{"id":71887,"logo_path":"/hEIju9dZK9SPeaGbo2kFcKbk1fc.png","name":"Heretical Reason Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":106322,"logo_path":null,"name":"Needle's Eye Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ron Delsener Presents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Delsener","original_name":"Ron Delsener","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64542d09091e6200e4cdb871","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Joel","original_name":"Billy Joel","popularity":0.3871,"profile_path":"/wXlIKgFnXK2Af6cetw9oF0kGcRc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64542d2b87a27a01723ce6c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Simon","original_name":"Paul Simon","popularity":0.4562,"profile_path":"/vWOVDx7feNDSpgI2njivbCeFvEu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64542d2fd48cee00fcee25de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patti Smith","original_name":"Patti Smith","popularity":0.2733,"profile_path":"/yrrJRuLam6oTJEeAIvvxq07eEEv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64542d38c04429018571f3b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Springsteen","original_name":"Bruce Springsteen","popularity":0.4422,"profile_path":"/et5hx6xJRnquGgEHGshmiAZZwgN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64542d96d8f44e0dadf4e3b7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Sumner","original_name":"Jake Sumner","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/lxskfr05POj1rAzDmta3uApOBQr.jpg","credit_id":"64542d20c04429018571f3a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Sumner","original_name":"Jake Sumner","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/lxskfr05POj1rAzDmta3uApOBQr.jpg","credit_id":"64542d50d48cee00e133be2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52161,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Randall Poster","original_name":"Randall Poster","popularity":0.2125,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64542d92091e620144d79826","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6740,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luke Geissbühler","original_name":"Luke Geissbühler","popularity":0.1842,"profile_path":"/tFaBfK33tLawDKxtz3Kke99RcGN.jpg","credit_id":"64542da233ad8f00e3c8f25c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James A.
