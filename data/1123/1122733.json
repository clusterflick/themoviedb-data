The production subsequently moved to a vacant pajama factory in New York's meatpacking district and went on to be presented by multiple European presenters. It was Abdoh's final work.  \"Quotations from a Ruined City is a sort of apocalyptic follies: an evening of song, dance, poetry, nudity and torture set in a world whose center has clearly long ceased to hold. Created and directed by the gifted young theatrical cult artist Reza Abdoh, the work is a kaleidoscopic catalogue of images of decay and destruction that range through the centuries and around the globe.\"--New York Times, 1994.","popularity":0.6163,"poster_path":"/aX86OkCEN9VUDJOcThSXK2tifUG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199369,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dar a Luz","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quotations From a Ruined City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina Artel","original_name":"Sabrina Artel","popularity":0.1269,"profile_path":"/ayuS86MgHb6EO9otP1HMKd6lruT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6455802d33ad8f01534e432a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Jacobs","original_name":"Peter Jacobs","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6455803a5a07f5017c8a18b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3851682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Durst","original_name":"Anita Durst","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6455804f5a07f500e4508c38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Ken Roht","original_name":"Billy Ken Roht","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6455807057d378013708df95","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4046897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Herst","original_name":"Mel Herst","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"645580815a07f5015dea026c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4046898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Jankee","original_name":"John Jankee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"645580905a07f5011f12a1fc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3098437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Pearl","original_name":"Tom Pearl","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6455809f1db65d015c2d24e4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Tom Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.1685,"profile_path":"/7OUqO0jvZfm5tSEWT6Cscooqsdp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"645580b157d378013708dfab","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Torn","original_name":"Tony Torn","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/dqu7CzsqSgFu2USNGl5oSNoiqHB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"645580c133ad8f00e26a7cfc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4046903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenden Doyle","original_name":"Brenden Doyle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"645580d712197e00febcdea9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Abdoh","original_name":"Reza Abdoh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645580ef5a07f50100ce51fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Abdoh","original_name":"Reza Abdoh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455810c33ad8f0136a7882a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4046911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Salar Abdoh","original_name":"Salar Abdoh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455811c5a07f500e4508c9a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1886502,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Soch","original_name":"Adam Soch","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455813a33ad8f01534e4397","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2268,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aX86OkCEN9VUDJOcThSXK2tifUG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285695,"name":"theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Quotations from a Ruined City (1993) Los Angeles -
