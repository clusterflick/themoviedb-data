Lundquist, served in  Vietnam in 1967-68. While there, he wrote hundreds of letters and recorded many hours of audio tapes that he sent to his wife and daughter. A mere months after returned from the war, he died. Jacqueline was barely 5 years old. Her mother gave her the letters and audio tapes in her teens, but she didn't read them until the summer of 1997 when she was 7 months pregnant with her son, Sam. She was 34. That set her on a journey of getting to know her dad and retracing his footsteps in Vietnam. She ultimately befriended a North Vietnamese soldier who had fought opposite her father. His family had also kept all the letters he had written back to his wife and daughter. This is their contrasting yet similar story.","popularity":1.1414,"poster_path":"/hry3TI3nTNfbE61ILFrJNEcSQ7u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Restorations Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":256155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jacqueline Lundquist Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Letters from the Battlefield","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Clinton","original_name":"Bill Clinton","popularity":0.5146,"profile_path":"/aOSAwUHkTYdcVrl5MdOzuGRluTm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663c1e0c18e80f9a66d926ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Love","original_name":"Mike Love","popularity":0.2897,"profile_path":"/d14ykjuRBcBhugMtnwxHSOnlEkS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663c1e1ec2e4e8af39236fd4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4702374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Ruth Lundquist","original_name":"Jacqueline Ruth Lundquist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663c1e3173d1cfbb05236fcb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4702376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Frank Celeste","original_name":"Richard Frank Celeste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663c1e44d13a3341ce7822a2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202785,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jude Pago","original_name":"Jude Pago","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d128604dc5f1a0b1eff23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202785,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jude Pago","original_name":"Jude Pago","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d129dac08aad7a81efdd0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4702374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Ruth Lundquist","original_name":"Jacqueline Ruth Lundquist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d12b4b82cd84c6df10a45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202785,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jude Pago","original_name":"Jude Pago","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d12e1b46c10f295a99b58","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4702374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Ruth Lundquist","original_name":"Jacqueline Ruth Lundquist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d13066900f915c21efbf0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30331647","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1255,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hry3TI3nTNfbE61ILFrJNEcSQ7u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":837}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"},{"id":240303,"name":"father daughter relationship"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
