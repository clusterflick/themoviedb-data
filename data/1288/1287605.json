While contemporary cinema manipulates reality by hiding itself, this experiment manifests the opposite in an explicit and evident way.  The film critic has been asked to travel to the city of Bergamo to participate in a 70-minute film experiment: savoring 2 kg of oysters and drinking 2 bottles of wine, while simultaneously answering 15 general knowledge questions and 15 solicitations of a private and personal nature. The outcome is a ruinous game in which the meaning of filming and the fragility of a human being merge into a melancholic testament.","popularity":0.208,"poster_path":"/rYJjMw655VFYoIh5PC0UUisxk8G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228510,"logo_path":null,"name":"5e6 Film","origin_country":""},{"id":115725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lab 80 film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2024-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ludendo docet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domenico Monetti","original_name":"Domenico Monetti","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"663cbbc52c188b14e79e6e3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Turca","original_name":"Vincenzo Turca","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"663cbbdeed3bfb762723f49d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annamaria Poma Swank","original_name":"Annamaria Poma Swank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"663cbbe9d0674f2601db8695","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Burroni","original_name":"Stefano Burroni","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"663cbbf66899a8d26adb7e10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonella Burroni","original_name":"Antonella Burroni","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"663cbbff18e80f9a66d99fc0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ferri","original_name":"Luca Ferri","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663cbb6d63679ef9a0d9a0b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725126,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Miele","original_name":"Andrea Miele","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663cbbab842dae1673fa4dba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrea Zanoli","original_name":"Andrea Zanoli","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663cbb85583b54b20b1ece56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2782432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Sorgato","original_name":"Luca Sorgato","popularity":0.788,"profile_path":"/3bnkFaaubJvW0HQpesGD2TK5NW2.jpg","credit_id":"6644ef84e2ea0743a41c759c","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/rYJjMw655VFYoIh5PC0UUisxk8G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156273,"name":"critic"},{"id":193223,"name":"film critic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Bellaria Film Festival 2024 : Concorso Gabbiano","release_date":"2024-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
