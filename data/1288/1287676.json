So are some of the sickest waves. In this follow-up to Absolute Mexico, director Josh Pomer trains his eye on surfing the Chilean coast. Along for the ride are some of the best surfers in the world. The crew scores a perfect reef that breaks in both directions. Joel Parkinson steals the show with his standup no grab backside tubes. Taylor Knox puts on a display of raw power through his use of rail turns. Cory Lopez shines in the ease of backdooring the wave. Aqua Luna has an all-star cast of interviews that brings us the unique perspective of the surfers featured. Cory Lopez, Bobby Martinez and Pancho Sullivan explain the razor sharp reef and the history of surfing in Chile. Then the all-star crew heads to a wave know as The Fish Factory, where the wave doubles up and spits and is named for its distinct smell.","popularity":0.3321,"poster_path":"/bugwjxQoa0mjBx1rGhzPShZnsFQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Aqua Luna has an all-star cast of interviews that brings us the unique perspective of the surfers featured.
