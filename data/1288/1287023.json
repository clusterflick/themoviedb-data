A trivial incident involving spilled chocolate milk prompts yet another altercation, prompting Agas to seek refuge in his vivid imagination: a whimsical house inhabited by Sura, his imaginary friend. Determined to quell his parents' strife by cleaning his stained shirt, Agas enlists Sura's reluctant help. However, their efforts lead to conflict as Sura's playful nature clashes with Agas's mission. As rain complicates Agas's task, desperation sets in. Sacrificing his beloved toys to dry his shirt, Agas inadvertently saddens Sura. Yet, through reconciliation, they engage in a final game, with Agas wagering Sura's departure. Emerging triumphant, Agas returns to reality, presenting his clean shirt as a symbol of resolution to his mother. \"Imaji\" is a poignant short film exploring the resilience of childhood innocence amidst familial turmoil.","popularity":0.0846,"poster_path":"/hO9k6V4AG6LmDXXkZQLDTXb3Am7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Table Two Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imaji","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abirama Putra Andresta","original_name":"Abirama Putra Andresta","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Agas","credit_id":"663b44ce2494790d3ae59d85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sapta Taliwang","original_name":"Sapta Taliwang","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sura","credit_id":"663b44e21dd0b624ed0b47e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Litany A Nainggolan","original_name":"Litany A Nainggolan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lia","credit_id":"663b451d09df4b8822e59be8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arief Sufyan","original_name":"Arief Sufyan","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pri","credit_id":"663b453323b085be4e0b42ae","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701112,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Lau","original_name":"Sam Lau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b4613a1b785b4028ed5c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3297889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arung Raditya","original_name":"Arung Raditya","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/ruU40m81jivtD4jyw8OSZIB4z9S.jpg","credit_id":"663b4558ff31fa4851ec904b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3297889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arung Raditya","original_name":"Arung Raditya","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/ruU40m81jivtD4jyw8OSZIB4z9S.jpg","credit_id":"663b45820c67a773043f37df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701111,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Phillip Martin","original_name":"Phillip Martin","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b45cd404a53bdb70b3e9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4026559,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Dian Alicia","original_name":"Dian Alicia","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b45fb69daf33d968dacff","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297893,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vincent Avielo Sentosa","original_name":"Vincent Avielo Sentosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b456ed05c021a7bd7bc26","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gSAJVm33aSkqu53qtFjvnSemKr4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1599}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"id","file_path":"/hO9k6V4AG6LmDXXkZQLDTXb3Am7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"Film Major Final Year Presentation","release_date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Imaji (2023) - Short Film Trailer","key":"PJ0iAeiWTfE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-16T16:56:36.000Z","id":"663b7d307e49dbb735d7dbcf"}]}}}
