Incorporating interviews with trans youth in Norfolk, O’Reilly’s debut feature gives its participants space to explain transness in their own words. Issues of discrimination, visibility, and media representation are discussed. Norfolk Trans Youth uses an eclectic pallet of stylistic techniques, attempting to find a new way to use the documentary format to reflect trans experiences. Merging factual documentary with experimental techniques, this is a visually inventive film centring a group often marginalised in conversations about their personhood.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Norfolk Trans Youth: Respecting & Understanding Differences","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole O'Reilly","original_name":"Nicole O'Reilly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d3c016d0c67ee18f1084a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
