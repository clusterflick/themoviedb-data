In the first, he walks through the streets of London, trailing a wooden drumstick along a series of metal railings, producing a percussive, sometimes bell-like noise. The camera follows behind, focusing on the stick as it strikes the railings. Occasionally, it cuts to wide-angle shots, capturing the awkward and oddly humorous presence of other people. In the second work, titled \"Samples II\" Alÿs appears even rawer, minimal and radical. He walks around London with a drumstick in hand, creating sounds by playing the metal fences beside him, without a melody. These works are a playful example of one of Alÿs’s ‘interventions’ in the city.","popularity":0.0943,"poster_path":"/fU9r0BfOAEYXFk3TZtvYmS5KkaY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Railings","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"663cd15da1e296ad0178a046","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663cd16fa8305594c5893b03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGE9PuGRaAh12SA6EwVbGhlUVri.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fU9r0BfOAEYXFk3TZtvYmS5KkaY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Francis Alÿs Railings (Fitzroy Square)","key":"shNztCR_W6E","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-05-06T13:59:30.000Z","id":"663cd25e32f2206f780e88a3"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Francis Alÿs Fitzroy Square","key":"tC4-op71sa4","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-03-05T20:10:20.000Z","id":"663cd249943cd61d389e7346"}]}}}
