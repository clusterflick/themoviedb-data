In cities in particular this separation of humans and the environment can only exist if mentally maintained and socially practiced. Through the past and present relations with pigeons this film forces the audience to confront our indifference, hatred and domination of environment as it peeks through the cracks of the urban. Because despite building ourselves into this isolation we will always be a part of the nature we attempt to eradicate.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/ctQoXYAQV9OJyN6aK6dTpMHrL4x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about the defiance of pigeons to our contradictory, and ultimately exploitative, relationship with the natural world.","title":"every dove is a pigeon and every pigeon is a dove","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Colenbrander","original_name":"Kate Colenbrander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d49e1ddef6428e70ebe38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Colenbrander","original_name":"Kate Colenbrander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d4a286899a8d26adbbb73","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Colenbrander","original_name":"Kate Colenbrander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d4a38333236d859a3d399","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nat Phillips","original_name":"Nat Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d4ac1548d8d7dad0eb8ca","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ctQoXYAQV9OJyN6aK6dTpMHrL4x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
