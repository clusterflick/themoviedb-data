I have always found my scoliosis very unattractive and never wear clothing which reveals my back. However, I do love the sea, glitter and sequins. I therefore decided to create a beautiful, be-sequinned sea monster out of my spine which would then dance according to my curvature.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Spine is a Beautiful Sea Monster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theresa Heath-Ellul","original_name":"Theresa Heath-Ellul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d393e18e80f9a66d9ce33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
