A naturally gifted fighter, Christy’s life transformed in 1989 when she met her manager and later husband, Jim Martin. Breaking boundaries, she became the first woman to sign with iconic promoter Don King and the only female boxer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Christy’s charisma, good looks, and unwavering resilience in the ring won her a wide fan base and propelled her to become welterweight champion. Behind this well-honed public persona, Christy tackled personal demons, toxic relationships, and an attempt on her life, proving that a fighter’s hardest-won victories aren’t always in the ring.","popularity":1.3875,"poster_path":"/qLntUTEQpq5Ojlo0n16y5DrESYl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10039,"logo_path":"/b8w4LldQolMKiLZw4FQJBcXSDGI.png","name":"Anonymous Content","origin_country":"US"},{"id":124854,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yoki","origin_country":"US"},{"id":34455,"logo_path":"/wTz9ZMSoxFBDnqrRZRwBLWpsQQO.png","name":"Votiv Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":184023,"logo_path":"/fpMQBF9krWUG3nPN4qV6d1ibkFM.png","name":"Fifty-Fifty Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":22146,"logo_path":"/v37N1mFeXNQfvPankg3feBhVvM7.png","name":"Black Bear Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Untitled Christy Martin Biopic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Sweeney","original_name":"Sydney Sweeney","popularity":19.5433,"profile_path":"/uDnIdU4KGjQg7liFvb9wnALvg95.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Christy Martin","credit_id":"663bf26018e80f9a66d9082d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Foster","original_name":"Ben Foster","popularity":1.238,"profile_path":"/p5FlM9OOStD9I0Nm3GGlhaiAC5r.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"James V.
