Jung-min, the lone non-disabled person, controls and supervises them as 98%’s representative. Jung-min embezzles donations for disabled people for personal gain and gaslights them through violence and illegal (sex offenses) filming. One day, a member(Ji-yoon) of 98% refuses to be filmed, so Jung-min goes in search of her. The person who appeared in front of Jung-min was not Ji-yoon, but Eunhye, a deaf girl he had never met before. Jungmin invites the beautiful and charming Eun-hye to become a new member of 98%, and he takes her to the filming location, an abandoned factory. Thanks to Eunhye, people donated a lot of money. However, the delight of money flowing in was short-lived because the members of 98% protested against Jungmin for his wrongdoings, and Eunhye suddenly disappeared. Where is Eunhye? Why are the members of 98% suddenly become disobedient?","popularity":0.3605,"poster_path":"/2BHHuZMkzigUp5hOvX63XlTNXbG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"98%","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Yun","original_name":"Park Yun","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eunhye","credit_id":"663bbd130439fd0d0f9ac3b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joo Young Woo","original_name":"Joo Young Woo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jungmin","credit_id":"663bbd39e6c45e882305cbb2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Somi Lim","original_name":"Somi Lim","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"663bbd621dd0b624ed0b6fdf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Do Kyung","original_name":"Kim Do Kyung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Yuri","credit_id":"663bbda9d05c021a7bd7eb7d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yun Won","original_name":"Yun Won","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Minseok","credit_id":"663bbdb9ff31fa4851ecb9c2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4860598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minseok Kim","original_name":"Minseok Kim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kihoon","credit_id":"66ab2cb1712c4e709d6c1955","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Woo Byun","original_name":"Chang Woo Byun","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663bbdea09df4b8822e5c889","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Woo Byun","original_name":"Chang Woo Byun","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663bbcfd2cb33fde35b5c5da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Woo Byun","original_name":"Chang Woo Byun","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663bbdc8270cc021b48dd711","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2BHHuZMkzigUp5hOvX63XlTNXbG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1658,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/27nFyc90xiTikhgQTK3IaEtXfXW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1105}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantasia Film Festival","release_date":"2024-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
