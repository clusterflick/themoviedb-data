This film is a response to Glasgow based artist Rosana Cadeâ€™s award-winning interactive performance of the same name, which invites audience members to embark on a carefully designed route through a town whilst holding hands with a series of different local participants. Shot entirely on mobile phones, the film follows the performance to 6 towns across the UK between June and November 2016, bookended by the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump. This unique collaborative documentary offers an insight into the intimate work at a particularly poignant time in terms of identity politics, weaving together a range of perspectives and experiences from across the country.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8AE6kJK6YhqTMWhJUe2YSBFWiqF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking:Holding","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosana Cade","original_name":"Rosana Cade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d3fe9333236d859a3d0b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8AE6kJK6YhqTMWhJUe2YSBFWiqF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
