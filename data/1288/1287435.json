This was a vital time for me developing films and projects with artists Toshiya Tsunoda, Christian Wolff and Larry Polanski. I recently discovered a roll I shot during this time - whilst on a visit to the Cape with Robert. The occasion stuck in my memory because of a particularly infection I had caught which made me reticent to travel or do anything. I recall Robert encouraging me to come anyway and to use my Bolex as a way of counter-acting the virus and my general state of malaise.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/yGHwhehLpKDTo83zBhz3rVxnXXM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Visit With Robert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"663c2bc863679ef9a0d939bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGHwhehLpKDTo83zBhz3rVxnXXM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Together: Overlapping Histories, Friendships & Dialogues","release_date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
