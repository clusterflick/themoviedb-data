His friend and drug-dealer Josef has an idea: Bring Karl to a drug deal to give him the experience he lacks. They pick up a run-down car with a drug-filled trunk and head towards the drop-off. On the way, Josef maneuvers his way out of a car breakdown and an arrest, but is powerless when it turns out the trunk has flown open and the drugs are gone. Using their criminal creativity, Josef and Karl dye painkillers blue to play them off as ecstasy. Karl is forced into the role of his life and pulls it off, until the drug-dealers call their bluff. Luckily, the cops are on their tail and a last-minute police intervention saves them. At the interrogation, Karl once again musters his survival-driven acting abilities, and acts his way out of it.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":228464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Runda Bordet Film","origin_country":""},{"id":228465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Birchwood","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Re:agera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3820612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fredrik Alfredsson","original_name":"Fredrik Alfredsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/5GNyNhurXbmN8nXLOg9ptByYQyk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karl","credit_id":"663c1d18532723af3a01367e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2628041,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Baleiro","original_name":"David Baleiro","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Josef","credit_id":"663c1d31e6f3e94d6a115606","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1105511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margareta Pettersson","original_name":"Margareta Pettersson","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/sBKxgUOClXhRIbneykX8mXLEi4K.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Casting Director","credit_id":"663c1d45a1e296ad017823d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Åberg","original_name":"Tommy Åberg","popularity":0.1902,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"663c1d54f647fe7460f068f0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2034311,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Max Brandhorst-Satzkorn","original_name":"Max Brandhorst-Satzkorn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/t75qY8LyfwtsRhhpXAe1ynlsEPu.jpg","credit_id":"663c1dc8f56a7dbb62daf974","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2034311,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Max Brandhorst-Satzkorn","original_name":"Max Brandhorst-Satzkorn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/t75qY8LyfwtsRhhpXAe1ynlsEPu.jpg","credit_id":"663c1d9a0fb291b7d588ab96","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4702367,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandra Tengvall","original_name":"Sandra Tengvall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663c1dc0354eb2aca591de75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1813810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jesper Jönsson","original_name":"Jesper Jönsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663c1db4b2ea28f015f06abd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4702364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joakim Gustafsson","original_name":"Joakim Gustafsson","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663c1d732bc41fae980dec5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4702370,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Magnus Klippberg","original_name":"Magnus Klippberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663c1dd318e80f9a66d92697","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1816281,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joakim Gustafsson","original_name":"Joakim Gustafsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663c1d7b89edb766d123735d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
