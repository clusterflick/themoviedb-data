Simonavičius. And how many Lithuanian astronauts were there? Two. And one of them was an architect. Ozė (V. Ozarinskas, 1961-2014) was an exceptional figure in the Lithuanian cultural scene. His works stand out in their scale, depth, and originality. Especially inconvenient to the viewer is Ozė’s “black” creative period. But is black color only the symbol of despair? Astrophysicists estimate that the better part of the Universe is composed of invisible dark matter. Seems like Ozė knew that very well.","popularity":0.1004,"poster_path":"/lGL62f0mEg1eQDt2BMXqELOKWv5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark matter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4711109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aušra Lukošiūnienė","original_name":"Aušra Lukošiūnienė","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6641e5a2c8593cf4be1df4c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3172218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nojus Drąsutis","original_name":"Nojus Drąsutis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6641e5eeedc44438db55b919","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4525080,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kristina Sereikaitė","original_name":"Kristina Sereikaitė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6641e5d7a582426fbe01bfba","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4711112,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rita Karklytė","original_name":"Rita Karklytė","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6641e6026a94499fbbe59fb3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"lt","file_path":"/lGL62f0mEg1eQDt2BMXqELOKWv5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1049}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
