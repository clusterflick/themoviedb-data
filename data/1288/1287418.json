The film includes interviews with film historians and descendants of the studio founders; re-photographed nitrate fragments of films that were produced at the Brooklyn studios over 100 years ago; and original footage shot inside the yeshiva school and of the building during and after demolition. The film explores both profound resistances and persistent echoes of national and local cultural histories, the archeology of the American film industry, local neighborhood demographics, gentrification, and politics.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dOuLezm3NHk6ZryKkzAMmuFVaeu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midwood Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Friedling","original_name":"Melissa Friedling","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663c233a8313cda910a326b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dOuLezm3NHk6ZryKkzAMmuFVaeu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
