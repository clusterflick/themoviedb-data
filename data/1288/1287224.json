Al-Muqannaʿ preached an ideological syncretism of Zoroastrianism, Mazdakism and Buddhism, and awakened the minds of his “White-Clothed” disciples by shedding light on the status quo of his time, challenging practices of land exploitation, authoritarian centralized power, and religious repression. His legacy, which might be seen today as “proto socialist,” was appropriated by the regional Soviet propaganda machine as a nativist heroic example of how to rise up and fight for the communal sharing of property and wealth.","popularity":0.0768,"poster_path":"/a9JY6oFdzoMGDTKc9Xy2kQelJNt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76361,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Between Art Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"UZ","name":"Uzbekistan"}],"release_date":"2024-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melted into the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Casas","original_name":"Carlos Casas","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/psABqoL4Ja4j6o5FdvBNc4TrGK9.jpg","credit_id":"663bb33edcd4ae478cd7f691","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saodat Ismailova","original_name":"Saodat Ismailova","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wuNcBewqNsieIrujr73SZi8AuEF.jpg","credit_id":"663bb32e08ba251f1805c48e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a9JY6oFdzoMGDTKc9Xy2kQelJNt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
