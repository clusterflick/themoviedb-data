Made completely spontaneously and very quickly, using whatever was around, drawings, photos and mostly shot with my phone. Just trying to break through the fog. Made purely for the sake of making something from nothing. Coming out of the pandemic (ish) I realised I had amassed over 70 of these - not films - just fragments of animation. All together they become a wayward mass that I suppose represents that uncertain period time. They were shown in my solo exhibition at Deptford Contemporary in July 2022 and then a smaller selection in October 2022 at Cube Microplex at a screening of my work organised by BEEF (Bristol Experimental and Expanded Film).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragments (2020-22)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin Rostron","original_name":"Edwin Rostron","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5e0e1a6965075d0cb795d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin Rostron","original_name":"Edwin Rostron","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5e0ec63ff7d608d45bff3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin Rostron","original_name":"Edwin Rostron","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d5e0fc4a779d2a5cb1aabd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
