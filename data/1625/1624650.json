The project consists of fragmentary test footage and partial scenes shot with Oja Kodar, intended as the basis for a longer film that was never completed. Welles did not assemble, edit, or finalize the material during his lifetime, leaving the project in an unfinished state as raw production footage rather than a completed film.  (Note: This entry represents the original unfinished Welles project. A separate posthumous edited version assembled in 1985 exists as a distinct derivative work.)","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zfoTlxEVM6kCkyJ1Zd3CWGkSDS2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dreamers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.803,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marcus Kleek","credit_id":"697a6aaf08fbfdb2c6a1d60e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oja Kodar","original_name":"Oja Kodar","popularity":0.5193,"profile_path":"/yLVbszgg91tvFjqYUzHB0fI5Wa0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pellegrina Leoni","credit_id":"697a6ac96b9c6eda5b12f7d4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.803,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"697a6a77995437fda6fc11eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.803,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"697a6a7c2b9731780c1f35e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5933838,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary Graver","original_name":"Gary Graver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a6a8554e4740d081f3684","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1934355","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zfoTlxEVM6kCkyJ1Zd3CWGkSDS2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
