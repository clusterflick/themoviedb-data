Surrounded by a house resembling a museum of the old Dubrovnik region, traditional tools, a rich library and ship models, Emir defies the fast-paced, modern world every day. The film, through his routine, work and free time, brings an intimate and poetic dedication to the former way of life, the island and the cultural heritage that is slowly disappearing. This is a film about work, identity and time that is disappearing, but also a film about Emir – a film about a man!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20915,"logo_path":"/g0ZgDi0m0RubOnoUFYaHsa8M5To.png","name":"Hrvatska Radiotelevizija","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2026-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emir - Posljednji dalmatinski težak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5967927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emir Slaković","original_name":"Emir Slaković","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6979ec902db00a292979c2db","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5967930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Neubert","original_name":"Nils Neubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6979ecf0df98a0fe6146196b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
