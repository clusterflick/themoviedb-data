It attempts to connect the elements of dance and movement in a natural forest environment. The camera records a new interpretation of the body, where the focus is on the human being and his relationship with the environment – on the individual confronting the natural world. Here, through the art of dance, the need for non-linear stories is expressed. It has its roots in nature, from which the choreography draws its inspiration, and ultimately finds a new form of expression through dance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contrada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209844,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matija Debeljuh","original_name":"Matija Debeljuh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697933a678a3af0dc6da4d54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
