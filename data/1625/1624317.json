Memories repeat. Certain rules appear without being discussed. The forest stays still, as if waiting for her to notice.\r She starts to recognize patterns the others ignore—who leads without asking, what gets remembered, what disappears. Meaning gathers around ordinary things. Silence becomes deliberate.\r When a way out finally presents itself, leaving feels wrong. Not because of the place—but because of what leaving would require her to admit.\r Whatever happened out there doesn’t end when the thoughts do.\r It just stops being shared.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":20,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The antlers know","title":"Antler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
