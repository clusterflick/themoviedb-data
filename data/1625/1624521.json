Shot in an ASMR-style this experimental film is filled with sneaky folk songs leading Raven to turn their sadness into rage, and their rage into action. It's an attempt at making a piece of agit prop directed at passive \"allies\" and liberals who are too busy protecting their cushy lives, to realise their inactivity is making them complicit. It’s a film about the process of changing your mind, about what you’re gonna do, when presented with new information.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/nGLhxtgyd3M7TaScfIrvNA1epHF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"anarchist agit-prop, direct action musical","title":"Boomerang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Lien","original_name":"Brenda Lien","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/6h8dHeEEgjbnQXMyjm7h0U2FIth.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Raven","credit_id":"697a3ac5e74a1289c693e65d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Lien","original_name":"Brenda Lien","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/6h8dHeEEgjbnQXMyjm7h0U2FIth.jpg","credit_id":"697a3ad8f48ccc10fb3a3df8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Lien","original_name":"Brenda Lien","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/6h8dHeEEgjbnQXMyjm7h0U2FIth.jpg","credit_id":"697a3ae55df33b40e24a2990","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Lien","original_name":"Brenda Lien","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/6h8dHeEEgjbnQXMyjm7h0U2FIth.jpg","credit_id":"697a3afb5e62cc56cb3a3df8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Lien","original_name":"Brenda Lien","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/6h8dHeEEgjbnQXMyjm7h0U2FIth.jpg","credit_id":"697a3b095e62cc56cb3a3dfc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Lien","original_name":"Brenda Lien","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/6h8dHeEEgjbnQXMyjm7h0U2FIth.jpg","credit_id":"697a3b1ddd1b2a36933a3e04","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Lien","original_name":"Brenda Lien","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/6h8dHeEEgjbnQXMyjm7h0U2FIth.jpg","credit_id":"697a3b31e69ec94306fc10b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q95186561","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"brenda.lien","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nSwSFMX9vKHqyWJreAUDvyLzgjZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nGLhxtgyd3M7TaScfIrvNA1epHF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":6382,"name":"folk music"},{"id":193933,"name":"comradeship"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":227148,"name":"anarchism"},{"id":317466,"name":"anti-imperialism"},{"id":350059,"name":"speculative fiction"},{"id":366581,"name":"agitation propaganda"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"distribution mainly outside the film industry","release_date":"2025-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
