The film centers around Silvia (Dirce Funari) who has suffered an attempted rape. She escapes the attack and is rescued by Claudio (Claude Maran), a photographer who takes her under his wing. Claudio is obsessed by war images that tell of death, devastation and pain. While working with a supermodel, Daniela (Danielle Dugas), a sado-masochistic relationship ensues. Things slowly build, with a fair dose of nudity and perversion. Silvia begins to fall in love with Claudio, however she struggles to discern between reality and her traumatic past, especially while Daniela, who is locked in a room, regresses to an almost bestial dimension.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aD3PwUxKw0uNyDW08mqJlUywSPw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2684844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Dugas","original_name":"Danielle Dugas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Daniela","credit_id":"697a62185bd5bbb0f4fc119f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2684845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Maran","original_name":"Claude Maran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Claudio","credit_id":"697a622b787f11f4b6fc120b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2684846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Dickson","original_name":"Joseph Dickson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Il negro","credit_id":"697a62465d161f5c4e3a3eb8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2684849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leda Simonetti","original_name":"Leda Simonetti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Leda","credit_id":"697a6256101488fd5393e6f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5968770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirce Funari","original_name":"Dirce Funari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Silvia","credit_id":"697a627905d5880eca93e6f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1853092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Brusatori","original_name":"Giovanni Brusadori","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":"/9zSz7Ia6I1kxlH40ZUNrY3IFuJk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Barman","credit_id":"697a62c2a93e68d6e3fc11ef","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aD3PwUxKw0uNyDW08mqJlUywSPw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
