In this hybrid work inspired by the show Ne Me Touchez Pas, the body is not only an instrument of movement, but a battlefield, a space where domination, resistance, and then rebirth are played out.  At the heart of this film is a duo formed by Marion Barbeau, prima ballerina at the Paris Opera and actress revealed by Cédric Klapisch's En Corps, and Félix Kysyl, actor nominated for a César Award in 2025 in the category of Best Male Newcomer for Miséricorde. These two protagonists give substance to a literally visceral performance, where skin, gazes, and breath invade everything.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5Vhe2iyJDfKgCtDjL2WKNrEPkm6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Films","origin_country":""},{"id":280985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belgica Films (BE)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2879089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Barbeau","original_name":"Marion Barbeau","popularity":0.27,"profile_path":"/9KJZhRxzMMDlwR8A9GpSPXLZ25W.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"697adc24831d6a316fb81a12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1645905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Kysyl","original_name":"Félix Kysyl","popularity":1.3526,"profile_path":"/5Likh6Ga5qP4szMBlC6xLIr82oY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"697adc3792a04562bda7eaf0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Bachman","original_name":"Laura Bachman","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697adca52dde76626822b729","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":940,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Vhe2iyJDfKgCtDjL2WKNrEPkm6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":627}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
