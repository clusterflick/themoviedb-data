The work relates to Pope.L’s broader interest in using food products to address social and political issues.  Notably, Small Cup was made in 2008, thirteen years before the storming of the Capitol building by a mob of Donald Trump supporters in January 2021. Pope.L commented that “The use of animals and gravity make the pieces more impersonal, as if it is the most natural thing in the world for things like governments to fall apart”.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/l2D71vGUbC0dWwfjyHmVvXRfi5o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Cup","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Pope.L","original_name":"William Pope.L","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a5b77083aea130bb166db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":825,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l2D71vGUbC0dWwfjyHmVvXRfi5o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
