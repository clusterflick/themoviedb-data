The film assembles five comic vignettes—Churchill, Swinging London, Four Clubmen, Stately Homes, and Tailors—originally produced for Welles’s abandoned television project Orson’s Bag. Edited into a 29-minute composite short for festival exhibition, the film represents a curatorial reconstruction rather than a completed work authored or released by Welles.  (Note: This is a posthumous archival assembly. The original unfinished project exists separately under the working titles London / Swinging London and was never completed or released by Orson Welles.)","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4tfmt5B7EtTL8f0v1LGdZGyZm38.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4898,"logo_path":"/nm8d7P7MJNiBLdgIzUK0gkuEA4r.png","name":"CBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Man Band","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Orson's Bag: One Man Band","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.803,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter / Various","credit_id":"697a332a798e7c7b4d461b16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Brooke-Taylor","original_name":"Tim Brooke-Taylor","popularity":0.2572,"profile_path":"/kKzfnLL7CEBdEL6eILZ8n0NDFgi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Reporter / Young Aristocrat","credit_id":"697a3337a97090212ccdbc88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Gray","original_name":"Charles Gray","popularity":1.0078,"profile_path":"/3H5YbhDgZq9fUk12aKm82wgDFsk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tailor","credit_id":"697a334bb8916ee5a5461c0b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Lynn","original_name":"Jonathan Lynn","popularity":0.4861,"profile_path":"/q1yanpd0HSPOENuyU267euwIdgY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tailor's Assistant","credit_id":"697a3359fbb0d240f22b20e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oja Kodar","original_name":"Oja Kodar","popularity":0.5193,"profile_path":"/yLVbszgg91tvFjqYUzHB0fI5Wa0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nancy Astor","credit_id":"697a33613779a83561ef3ce6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graeme Garden","original_name":"Graeme Garden","popularity":3.7527,"profile_path":"/aQB8GLphqQtPTBoWnWXAlO9iG3F.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Various","credit_id":"697a336965f9f385e7ccaf88","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.803,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"697a337b88094e160e82e5e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.803,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"697a33834e63d1beef82e73b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.803,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"697a338bc02c97620d69264b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5933838,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary Graver","original_name":"Gary Graver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a3393d0b76364b882e684","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":792304,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomislav Pinter","original_name":"Tomislav Pinter","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a339b93249c84d9ef3c7d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471056,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivica Rajković","original_name":"Ivica Rajković","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a33a53779a83561ef3ceb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46144,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giorgio Tonti","original_name":"Giorgio Tonti","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a33ac4e63d1beef82e73e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0289993","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4tfmt5B7EtTL8f0v1LGdZGyZm38.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
