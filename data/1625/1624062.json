Young Tom gets his first job as a telegraph operator or \"lighting slinger\" for Atlantic and Western Telegraph. Even at his tender age, he's their fastest operator, but his penchant for constant experimentation is frowned on and even ridiculed by his superiors.  When these scientific activities begin to interfere with his daily duties, he loses his job—and goes on to Western Union where he embarks on a career of innovation and invention that changes the world forever!  A charming film that's entertaining and educational for any age.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Second Rare TV Drama with Mark Twain","title":"Tom Edison: The Boy Who Lit Up the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0316781","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
