Construction workers have begun erecting a 43-kilometer-long inner-city wall. West Berliners stand stunned on one side, East Berliners on the other, facing each other at the sector border. The entire city is in shock. Citizens take their cameras and video recorders out of their closets and document the events. From then on, many Berliners and visitors to Berlin produce their own documentaries about life in a changed city.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To the border - A private view of the wall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerald Grote","original_name":"Gerald Grote","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a28be3cb9dfd2c982e632","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerald Grote","original_name":"Gerald Grote","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a28d0eda6ece1e22b1fa3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claus Oppermann","original_name":"Claus Oppermann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a28e28bfb18bc0cccaf31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claus Oppermann","original_name":"Claus Oppermann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a28f07c0840f45eef3ca9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claus Oppermann","original_name":"Claus Oppermann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a28faeda6ece1e22b1fa6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claus Oppermann","original_name":"Claus Oppermann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a2907bb0bb717ed14e9c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
