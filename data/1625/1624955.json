A rumor spreads of a mythical rave beyond the cosmic microwave background, where cosmic rhythm and meaning are said to be controlled. Crooner-Boy (CB), a clumsy 40-year-old singer with a powerful voice, and Lena Ivkovic, a young activist, performer, and DJ, unite to find it. They convince Commander Plank, a narcissistic space traveler, to take them aboard his ship, the Discovery 2. Plank is on a mission vital to the Universe’s fate: finding a new home for an endangered cosmic species. Their paths collide as they struggle, love, sing, and explore space in Quantum Rave, a musical space opera blending humor, science fiction, action, relativity, and quantum mechanics, while playfully examining anthropocentrism, estrangement, and the role of art.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quantum Rave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32014158","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
