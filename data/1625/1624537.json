Their inner monologue speaks in a woman’s voice, unsettling identity and suggesting the film unfolds inside an unseen mind. As inner and outer worlds blur, the figure falls inward—into a bowl of split pea soup—an absurd yet intimate image hinting at wholeness. The film resists resolution, lingering in the space between.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":5000,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Neither here nor there","title":"Dream Ninety-Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
