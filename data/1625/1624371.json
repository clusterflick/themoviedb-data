Through advertisements, trailers, intermissions, and commentary, the audience watches a movie as it is being watched—self-referential and deeply personal. At its center is Neil, a man confronting the failure of art, identity, and intention. Guided by an intimate narrator and a sequence of evocative images, Neil undergoes an internal transformation, finding solace in a community of like-minded people. Yet the connection proves insufficient. His deeper longing is for absolute unity to dissolve the self and become one with the world. This impossible ideal is embodied by Siya and Shesha, figures representing infinity, idealism, and paradox. In questioning art, belonging, and perfection, the film embraces irony as its core truth: meaning emerges through failure.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ntuDFCM7T0TcHnP06cH7lu5s78G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Killhous3","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2026-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Between images, a revolution begins.","title":"LAKSHYA By Killhous3","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5967960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"charsbabu","original_name":"charsbabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6979f7ba08405866fd82e598","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5967962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivek Sabnani","original_name":"Vivek Sabnani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6979f83445ae3543b2cdbd99","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5967963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siya Garg","original_name":"Siya Garg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6979f84301c41f34b5ccae15","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5967966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shivani","original_name":"Shivani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6979f8d5bdb243d846461904","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5967968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharvansh Chaudhary","original_name":"Sharvansh Chaudhary","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6979f8fb3a0265915682e4f3","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5967970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil","original_name":"Neil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6979f92108b2e74fd914e8fd","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5968128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shesha Kamboj","original_name":"Shesha Kamboj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"697a10fb2db00a292979c411","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":4953140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"raghavngpl","original_name":"raghavngpl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1vLHgrfcnRu7uuSLdjgDBT8M1PW.jpg","credit_id":"6979feb14f016e755b79c3bf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5968002,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rohit Paul","original_name":"Rohit Paul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6979fedd45ae3543b2cdbdc9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5968005,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Revat","original_name":"Revat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6979ff01d0b76364b882e501","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5506841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aashi Sinha","original_name":"Aashi Sinha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a0db51334611f8879c3b3","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mU9GG1cEi5oMYJUGEsdVaxz71Gm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":0.998,"height":8606,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yP8FkQJAohVB3a4sq6PO0FviFTk.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":8586}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ntuDFCM7T0TcHnP06cH7lu5s78G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tgpxGFUXyrcbNfJFQsmPKrjI8R5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11130,"name":"art house"},{"id":319684,"name":"fashion film"},{"id":325775,"name":"awestruck"},{"id":360713,"name":"indie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
