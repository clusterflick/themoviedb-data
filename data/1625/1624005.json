It unfolds as a journey through the quiet moments of a couple at ease with one another, enclosed in the bubble they have created. Their gestures are subtle, and the safe space surrounding them becomes part of their story.  Without dialogue or voice-over, the story unfolds through the images, which shapes the emotions that emerge. An original musical arrangement carries the narrative, enhancing and guiding this journey.  Time intrudes through clocks, calendars, and digital displays, yet each object remains blank.  Can this illusion endure where reality cannot be denied?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/moxOBO2rxVyWKQlV5J6Xq86UMVN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2026-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brume de Temps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariam Bezuneh","original_name":"Mariam Bezuneh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"69792ae1743f8c3d5a51b170","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mees Doezejager","original_name":"Mees Doezejager","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Man","credit_id":"69792af2ad656e260351b148","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197109,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Grünewald","original_name":"Tim Grünewald","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6979293451c406017e6b0720","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966919,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jasmijn Diebels","original_name":"Jasmijn Diebels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69792950676b5528766a1993","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966921,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Floris Kuipers","original_name":"Floris Kuipers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6979299df1cc122eef6a1951","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Archie Tulk","original_name":"Archie Tulk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69792a1bfed64a1b0e51b186","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966924,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amaia Turumbay","original_name":"Amaia Turumbay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69792a579b4b04ca2c6b0711","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966925,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Designori","original_name":"Alex Designori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69792a778a993b8b1be6afa6","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Basta","original_name":"Igor Basta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69792a91751347c57e18e901","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966928,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Justin Coste","original_name":"Justin Coste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69792aad2acbf48f165ae562","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197109,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Grünewald","original_name":"Tim Grünewald","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69793ae468671aa7ddfe4252","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fFJRalKdCD1nX1aoPcQxdk2q9Iw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/moxOBO2rxVyWKQlV5J6Xq86UMVN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5609,"name":"nostalgia"},{"id":6056,"name":"tenderness"},{"id":33513,"name":"desire"},{"id":206626,"name":"perception"},{"id":208781,"name":"intimacy"},{"id":245873,"name":"analogue"},{"id":285070,"name":"no dialogue"},{"id":292636,"name":"fragile"},{"id":315517,"name":"16mm film"},{"id":355144,"name":"timeless"},{"id":356718,"name":"black & white"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
