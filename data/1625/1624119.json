West Empire is an immersion into the heart of these towns left behind after the mining era and in which a few people still persist to live today. In a setting of American deserts, these inhabitants live a timeless life with one priority: the search for freedom. Referring to their past, these men and women bring a strong testimony of their life experience. In the light of these atypical encounters, the film makes us think about how our modern society is governed, about time and the importance of living in the moment of now.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Empire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5436144","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
