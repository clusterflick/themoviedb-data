Everywhere you go, paths begin to open and multiply. You can go anywhere you want, and with each place you choose, a new version of yourself emerges. You begin to disappear and in that disappearance you feel free: no longer being one, but becoming another, becoming many others. Individual experience gives way to the collective. A constant search for a place in the world. Walking toward the other, toward the unknown—yesterday, today, and tomorrow.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":148682,"logo_path":"/6lXGKcIUwd2DUzjHiYuKca9pj9W.png","name":"Errante
