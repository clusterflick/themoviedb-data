Trey's mission in life is clear: to uncover the truth behind what some might dismiss as mere 'conspiracy theories,' yet he has seen firsthand the dreadful and atrocious acts that have long been hidden from the world. Seeking methods to shield himself, particularly as the sole survivor, he strives to amplify the voices of the unheard and bring clarity to the unresolved.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bM8Zf6uso8h3FkORPSLJXxy3LhK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Where are the children?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leyton Benta","original_name":"Leyton Benta","popularity":0.0436,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"697a06adc9193740fd692454","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leyton Benta","original_name":"Leyton Benta","popularity":0.0436,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a069bc02c97620d692532","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leyton Benta","original_name":"Leyton Benta","popularity":0.0436,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697a06a77c0840f45eef3bd6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bM8Zf6uso8h3FkORPSLJXxy3LhK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":767}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Leyton Benta : Where are the children?
