Simple things — walking, talking - are difficult for him. To overcome the disease, he is engaged in diving. The coach treats Nikita the same as the others, without making allowances for disability. And the boy begins to succeed: he jumps from 3, 5 and 7 meters. The last frontier remains — a 10-meter tower... But the gift prepared for him — the railway — goes to another boy, also Nikita, who makes his first jump in his life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2006-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nikita and Nikita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4154033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Tyulyaeva","original_name":"Maria Tyulyaeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64aac245fa78cd00adc1413f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
