As he stands in the corner, his back to the wall, he appears to be lying down; falling backwards into the corner and then pushing himself off the wall again, he appears to be trying to levitate himself... As he performs these actions, his hands slam into the wall to break his falls, and the sounds become an integral part of the activities filmed. -- EAI","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/7wzoML3u9SdojfzMADuXZ2vUzja.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bouncing in the Corner No. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a914619c97bd00ff1a5bd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7wzoML3u9SdojfzMADuXZ2vUzja.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
