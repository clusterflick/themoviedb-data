He self-harms and is constantly bullied for his feminine appearance. After his biological father came out, he left an old camera to Billy. Billy’s mother remarried three times and moved to the United States with her current stepfather. After Billy’s younger sister drowned, the family was abandoned by their stepfather and had to return to Taiwan. One day, after taking a bath, Billy muttered to himself, “I promise to accompany you,” with several medicine jars beside him. He then sat on the toilet and fantasized about having sex with a snail, feeling both pleasure and disgust.","popularity":0.1581,"poster_path":"/wg7V2qRXVErl9y66TnGZppkG9H5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2024-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Killed Billy Billie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4150979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Lin","original_name":"林子璿","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64a7cb20af2da800ca585426","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jieh-Wen King","original_name":"金介文","popularity":0.3012,"profile_path":"/lZWdwrjVBlkWoRcm9PrNUBQgmLX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64a7cb2b65c26c012dfa02bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3783415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ting-Hsuan Lin","original_name":"Ting-Hsuan Lin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66894a7ac0808984dba384a5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4150980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"LIN Yu-wei","original_name":"LIN Yu-wei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a7cb56957e6d00e2110859","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"61560699639181","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fUBQs6dbvAvX67BmvboYtPWleYl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d6IrqQCYYwjOnAHp90HKBSoBfg4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/wg7V2qRXVErl9y66TnGZppkG9H5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
