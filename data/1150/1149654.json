The film uses comedy to puncture the sanctimony surrounding this seminal event, as well spinning a more obscure yarn: the rise and demise of Slippy Jim Aplomb, the preeminent current-events bard of our time. Our two characters seize on 9/11 in polar ways: for Fogleberg, it becomes a botched opportunity to snag the journalistic limelight, while Slippy seizes the moment to convert the rage of the nation into an anthem; a chant for the bereaved.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fCtIPUIohNTmhlekxhm27wqFQr8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BLOWBACK Season One: The Rise of Slippy Jim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Strohmeier","original_name":"Ryan Strohmeier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Slippy Jim Aplomb","credit_id":"64a9b0383e2ec800cbcd5487","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Brophy","original_name":"James Brophy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dan Fogelberg","credit_id":"64a9b060b686b900cc0928d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Barthelme","original_name":"Sam Barthelme","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Glen Merengue","credit_id":"64a9b075b686b9012f8679c6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Zanko","original_name":"Pete Zanko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Many Times his Namesake","credit_id":"64a9b08a66a0d300e37339d3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Wyatt","original_name":"Luke Wyatt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9b12f6a344800c9fa9680","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Wyatt","original_name":"Luke Wyatt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9b0c7d1a89300c574e722","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Wyatt","original_name":"Luke Wyatt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9b1066a344800ea8c0066","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fCtIPUIohNTmhlekxhm27wqFQr8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1152}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
