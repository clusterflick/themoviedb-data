When he receives a mysterious invitation for a weekend retreat from his childhood benefactor Miss Havisham, he thinks his bad luck is about to change. Only, Miss Havisham never actually shows up. Instead, Pip is reunited with his first love, the beautiful but emotionally cold Estella. He also meets Avery Harper, a chef with an agenda, Bernard Nasby, a hedge fund manager with a chip on his shoulder, and a group of other characters who have all been invited to play Havishamâ€™s succession game and solve a riddle that could unlock the inheritance of her fortune. The weekend takes an unexpected twist when one of the guests ends up dead and everyone present becomes a suspect.","popularity":0.7765,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expectations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Callan McAuliffe","original_name":"Callan McAuliffe","popularity":0.6678,"profile_path":"/prb72bUO481G2Kxk55dD0LLnCAj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pip Pirrip","credit_id":"64aa6b63b686b900af9e0ffd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1827498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blu Hunt","original_name":"Blu Hunt","popularity":1.1815,"profile_path":"/5ilXt7HoEbaJPYZbmRYDDRXvve.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Estella Drummle","credit_id":"64aa6b8d66a0d300ade82c61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1358460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Q.
