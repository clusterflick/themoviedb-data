Its waters cross the largest tropical forest in the world: the Amazon, “the lungs of the earth”. Going against the current of this gigantism, this documentary is betting on approaching this extraordinary natural space through one of its tiniest productions: the cocoa bean. Scientists, chocolate makers, producers and farmers, many are those who, faced with the deforestation of this unique ecosystem, use this chocolate seed to recreate, on a small scale, human exploitations in harmony with nature. This film tells us about the fight of those who decided to make cocoa the spearhead of environmental defense in Brazil.","popularity":0.2709,"poster_path":"/6fM6tQ8rHTIR6Dxs2XBWScW0Ybf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123069,"logo_path":"/A1d6ImzSI87AE4WgCKhEovfzzZD.png","name":"Lucien TV","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":110387,"logo_path":"/fJxexB8pz1AidTjsjXmP3BdFMZj.png","name":"Ushuaïa TV","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Du Chocolat Pour Sauver l'Amazonie","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertrand Delapierre","original_name":"Bertrand Delapierre","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/hyBFTuWSpmGVjeRAyr1ANj7tIhP.jpg","credit_id":"64a95a9d6a344800c9fa7635","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27766765","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cfsoyxIBCuvuPgRwxC617RtVAYB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6fM6tQ8rHTIR6Dxs2XBWScW0Ybf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":264118,"name":"brazil"},{"id":285793,"name":"fair trade"},{"id":320090,"name":"amazonie"},{"id":320091,"name":"modialisme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
