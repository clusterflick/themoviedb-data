This videotape was based on these exercises and were the first videotapes Nauman made in a professional studio. They also were the first to use performers other than himself and to utilize an optical effect. (His earlier videos all employ a fixed camera and a single long take.) \"We used two cameras and changed locations from time to time,\" recalled Nauman in a 1979 interview. \"What I was investigating at that time was how to examine a purely mental activity as opposed to a purely physical situation which might incur some mental activity.\" -- EAI","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elke Allowing the Floor to Rise Up Over Her, Face Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a916446a3448014d313dc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
