As such, many ground crew in Allied air units are being filled by women. One such unit is the 9,000 strong Women's Division of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Getting recruits on average of several hundred per month, the Division is comprised of women from all backgrounds. The recruits ask for no special favors and know that the work they will be doing is hard and important all for the war effort. The women endure much the same as their male counterparts. And much as the men do, their work ranges from the technical engineering functions in support of the bombers themselves, but also in all aspects of the military. Many prepare for their post-war life where their work will act in the support of the civilian air services","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1943-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wings on Her Shoulder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Marsh","original_name":"Jane Marsh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64aaac97d1a89300c57585cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2330534","wikidata_id":"Q18211247","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1943-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
