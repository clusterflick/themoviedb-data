Since 2011, her research is focused on the film production in Guinea-Bissau, the beginnings of which were closely linked to the struggle for liberation. In February 2014, in Birbam, about three hours north of the capital Bissau, for the period of three weeks she has been documenting, together with the filmmaker Suleimane Biai, the construction of a house that will serve the surrounding villages as a meeting space. Alongside his work as a filmmaker, Suleimane Biai is the régulo in this region and hence has assumed the duties of the head and conciliator of the community.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/iiEaJAv6niNHl2ZnG6jc1smNhxI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GW","name":"Guinea-Bissau"}],"release_date":"2014-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regulado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suleimane Biai","original_name":"Suleimane Biai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a92d32b686b901500f38ee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1741263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipa César","original_name":"Filipa César","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zAEecL0Tk0taY17i50RXSDzJZuk.jpg","credit_id":"64a92c546a3448014d314ba6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suleimane Biai","original_name":"Suleimane Biai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a92c86d1a89300adbe9685","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134834,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jenny Lou Ziegel","original_name":"Jenny Lou Ziegel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a92ca53e2ec800ec863f8e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dídio Pestana","original_name":"Dídio Pestana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a92cb36a344800ea8bcb49","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2516811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno da Luz","original_name":"Nuno da Luz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a92cc13e2ec8012ee2c912","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iiEaJAv6niNHl2ZnG6jc1smNhxI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
