Lucchetti: O Cronista do Além","overview":"The greatest writer of fantastic literature, horror and suspense in the world is Brazilian and he is alive! At 93 years old, Rubens Francisco Lucchetti has many stories to tell. And that's what he does on this DVD, the first of his career, in an exclusive and relaxed interview, where he goes over his long career.  Author of nearly 1700 books (mostly horror and thrillers), many using various pseudonyms, he could have been in the Guinness Book of World Records, but he was never interested in it. He preferred to write non-stop.  He was also one of the greatest writers of Brazilian comics, having written 300 scripts for horror comics illustrated by legendary artists such as Rodolfo Zalla, Eugenio Colonnese, Nico Rosso and Edmundo Rodrigues, among others.  He partnered with filmmakers José Mojica Marins (Coffin Joe) and Ivan Cardoso, having written 25 films for them, all classics of national cinema.","popularity":0.13,"poster_path":"/svMGwBj784NMF9zUsh3mk6nILC6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R.F.
