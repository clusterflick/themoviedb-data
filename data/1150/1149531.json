A total solar eclipse is a breathtaking event and this documentary programme conveys that awesome feeling by exploring how and why eclipses happen. A mixture of computer-generated views from outer space, footage of eclipses throughout the 20th century (some taken as early as 1927) and original footage taken of this year's total solar eclipse (shot in Cornwall) make this programme a celebration of eclipse mania.","popularity":0.1626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":203723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elements Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eclipse 1999","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Cameron","original_name":"James Cameron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"(narrator)","credit_id":"64a961f26a344800c9fa7996","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152592,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Will Bowen","original_name":"Will Bowen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9622d3e2ec800af7cee5f","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152593,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jason Presley","original_name":"Jason Presley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a962376a344800ad755109","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152593,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jason Presley","original_name":"Jason Presley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9624a6a3448010b6fd74d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152595,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phamie MacDonald","original_name":"Phamie MacDonald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a962569c97bd011c58333d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nichola Vickers","original_name":"Nichola Vickers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a962653e2ec8012ee2e395","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2642,"name":"solar eclipse"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VHS","release_date":"1999-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
