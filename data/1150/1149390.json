She is reminded of the reason why she left the force when the six-year-old case file on her husband's murder is reopened and a suspect, Kevin Tarpley, is arrested. Kevin denies being the killer but does seem to have insider information about Ian's death; unfortunately, Kevin is gunned down in the street soon after his arrest. When Joanne is confronted by Kevin's mysterious wife, Maureen Gault, at a party in front of all of Ian's old politician friends, she begins investigating. Soon, she finds herself the chief suspect in a murder, and she also discovers that Ian's old friends aren't exactly friends to her. This film is the fourth in a series featuring Joanne Kilbourn; it resolves the murder of her husband and her longstanding flirtatious relationship with her ex-partner, Millard.","popularity":1.1487,"poster_path":"/mfmoux3gCh77V6gy1LoRhsEAjQS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Television (CTV)","origin_country":""},{"id":2476,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carlton America","origin_country":""},{"id":6252,"logo_path":"/9b3MKk54TG6p059z0t9j4bqgnom.png","name":"Shaftesbury Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Colder Kind of Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Criminal Instinct: A Colder Kind of Death","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendy Crewson","original_name":"Wendy Crewson","popularity":1.462,"profile_path":"/6hplkzK8KV5Cw8Z8SVKwlt3nU5I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joanne Kilbourn","credit_id":"64dff1585ab81a01391a127d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":266367,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"R.B.
