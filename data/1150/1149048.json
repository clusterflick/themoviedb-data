In “Circus 196977,” a mysterious documentarian encounters the group in a large barn and tracks their medley of song and dance. The film features avant-garde dance sequences paired with varied pieces of pop music in-between spoken interludes from each of the performers. Filmed in the dead of the night, the film bridges elements of an eerie found-footage style horror film with a uniquely choreographed performance piece.","popularity":0.1479,"poster_path":"/9gOeEHu2Y4wFNDs896UlJfAWWNp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circus 196977","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassidy Wingate","original_name":"Cassidy Wingate","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Lion Tamer's Apprentice","credit_id":"64a83452957e6d0139cfcda0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delaney Rath","original_name":"Delaney Rath","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Esmerelda Meadows","credit_id":"64a83463957e6d00c5dd3854","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily DeForest","original_name":"Emily DeForest","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Skittles Lament","credit_id":"64a83472af2da8010cadd771","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dyer Rhoads","original_name":"Dyer Rhoads","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tech Guy","credit_id":"64a8348096522000e39b50ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Neema Blake","original_name":"Ariel Neema Blake","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"in The Light in the Attic","credit_id":"64a8349765c26c014edcf2eb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2067034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cricket Brown","original_name":"Cricket Brown","popularity":0.4049,"profile_path":"/kYBJ9YItPmbvl3009eKAkvkIlYl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"cowboy","credit_id":"64a834a5957e6d0139cfcdbd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2067034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cricket Brown","original_name":"Cricket Brown","popularity":0.4049,"profile_path":"/kYBJ9YItPmbvl3009eKAkvkIlYl.jpg","credit_id":"64a83576f056d5013904ea55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77kSPLGZXd22l1g3sBm3QE18Cnu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gOeEHu2Y4wFNDs896UlJfAWWNp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
