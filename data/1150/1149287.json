Now the whole world can be brought into the farmer's living room. First, the farmer gets enough static to blow his hair off. But soon, the set is working well, and Al Falfa gets to hear music from around the world. He and the farm animals (and mice) all enjoy dancing to the music coming over the air. When he gets to a bullfight in Spain, he's so inspired that he goes out to battle his cow. The cow doesn't think much of the odds, and she gets the local bull as a stand-in. Poor Farmer Al Falfa never knew what hit him. Even his new radio turns on him.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tuning In","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0147631","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
