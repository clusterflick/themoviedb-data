A VHS tape featuring a 25 minute video of a day in the life of a unique man named \"Danny\" (Who would later go on to be known as \"The Tourettes Guy\" on the internet.) was given as a Christmas gift. Only about a dozen people were lucky enough to see that first video, but lots of people got to hear some of the audio from it because the people who filmed with Danny got a kick out of putting Danny's vulgar rants on their answering machines as a way to deal with all the telemarketers that were calling people back then.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tourettes Guy","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Unreleased VHS","release_date":"2000-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
