A lengthy split screen image of two train tracks running alongside each other serves as the centerpiece of the film, generating an ever forward-moving space for the viewer’s own individual inhabitance and visually guided meditation. Forced momentum through a gradient between two concurrent planes in space-time. The first fifteen minutes stand as a primer for this experience. Images flash by in slow motion; an examination of a fractured, cloudy, ever-morphing, collective mental landscape. The film serves as a lens to view the technological present as well as a deceptively simple map towards the future.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/lVDWy5DUlbpXBenyenZsiOUfr9w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Train of Interference","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connor Parsley","original_name":"Connor Parsley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jGLmCySSFGlDGjTyDVOgQ63jaFP.jpg","credit_id":"64a8f7b266a0d300c66dbeb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lVDWy5DUlbpXBenyenZsiOUfr9w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Train of Interference (2022, Dir.
