They hold up the mirror to us of a past in which we can recognize ourselves, despite the geographical and cultural distance. This semi-nomadic people who depend on livestock is not well known.  Traditional donga fighting, a duel with sticks, earned them a reputation for brutality which keeps outsiders at a distance. In fact, the donga is a martial art that celebrates values necessary for survival in a region torn by tribal warfare. This nation of 28,000 souls possesses nothing other than its livestock. Its impoverished condition is an art of extreme living that commands respect.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8rPigaoBmrCGoLiYnGV6z5gfCNI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Samurai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421267,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Garnault","original_name":"Françoise Garnault","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a3966a3448014d317f48","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152986,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernard Mathieu","original_name":"Bernard Mathieu","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a37c66a0d300c66e0f15","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Estève","original_name":"Pierre Estève","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a3a7b686b9010e0ba2b5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Queyrat","original_name":"Jean Queyrat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a3533e2ec8010dab3d44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2633912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":1465,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8rPigaoBmrCGoLiYnGV6z5gfCNI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
