Exploring their history, challenges, art form, influences and experiences that led them to activism, the documentary will provide an understanding of the realities of life as a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault. Though the film will tell each story honestly, mixing visuals of the artist at work, voiceover interviews describing events and dramatic actor re-enactments, the overall message will highlight how each artist has turned something so ugly into something beautiful that inspires hope.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":81077,"logo_path":null,"name":"My Love For Writing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Art As A Voice is a feature-length documentary examining how five female artists use their artwork to effect change.","title":"Art As A Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phoenix Amor","original_name":"Phoenix Amor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Singer and Domestic Violence Survivor","credit_id":"57cda483925141515900912f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Upshur","original_name":"Tanya Upshur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Reenactment Actor/Abuse Victim","credit_id":"57cda4b0c3a3680a3f000ebc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Jones","original_name":"Jason Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Reenactment Actor/Abuser","credit_id":"57cda4c592514174f8000da2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Bullock","original_name":"Lauren Bullock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Spoken Word Artist/Rape Survivor","credit_id":"57cda4f49251417958004434","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675040,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Jenemann","original_name":"Laura Jenemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda579c3a36868a1004271","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675039,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shanon Lee","original_name":"Shanon Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda528c3a3680aa5000c78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675041,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bennie Pearce","original_name":"Bennie Pearce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda5539251417587000f2f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675043,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anne Saul","original_name":"Anne Saul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda538c3a36868860040ee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katherine Velle","original_name":"Katherine Velle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda55e9251417958004469","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675039,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shanon Lee","original_name":"Shanon Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda51e925141752d000e76","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675041,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bennie Pearce","original_name":"Bennie Pearce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda546c3a3680a3f000f24","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5771330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15061,"name":"docudrama"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"In Pre-Production","release_date":"2017-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
