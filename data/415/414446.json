Unfortunately, the men's papers fell behind a filing cabinet and it is many years before the government realizes they exist. Meanwhile, the men have forged new identities and a good life for themselves as they loyally keep up their production. When the government decides to send a team of experts to handle the situation, the two men prepare to eject these unwanted arrivals at any cost.","popularity":0.2007,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un bruit qui court","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Laloux","original_name":"Daniel Laloux","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":"/241XlhzLnvUZiudWg2hxFhQJN2J.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Georges Loutier","credit_id":"57ce655cc3a3683ccc0015f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Sentier","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Sentier","popularity":0.126,"profile_path":"/kMezU0OfVJVqbbmzBrH6eLuz4tt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Piotre Hernandez","credit_id":"57ce656ac3a3683d76001618","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence","original_name":"Florence","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57ce657cc3a3682448001d12","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Baillot","original_name":"Pierre Baillot","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/il5Q2Ni6rkwGEaqyHBYyWVcqyN2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Titi","credit_id":"57ce658592514160ce001512","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Frérot","original_name":"Alain Frérot","popularity":0.0826,"profile_path":"/zVNKKRmaVWHOJmSpSm82HmF2IQP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tata","credit_id":"57ce659ec3a3682448001d20","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Dubillard","original_name":"Roland Dubillard","popularity":0.1135,"profile_path":"/3TAXxLpZHhAVYN8mDINMi1TzOkl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The voice of the Ministry of Labor (voice)","credit_id":"57ce65a492514160ce00151c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Laloux","original_name":"Daniel Laloux","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":"/241XlhzLnvUZiudWg2hxFhQJN2J.jpg","credit_id":"57ce643d92514119ce0000a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Sentier","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Sentier","popularity":0.126,"profile_path":"/kMezU0OfVJVqbbmzBrH6eLuz4tt.jpg","credit_id":"57ce644cc3a36806d600009c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0298198","wikidata_id":"Q65153956","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
