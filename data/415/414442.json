Once on shore, they make the acquaintance of a like-minded young widow who begins an affair with both men (she just wants to have a child by each) -- but their unusually idyllic existence is threatened with imminent tragedy as the French army advances ever closer.","popularity":0.1762,"poster_path":"/jtNB7LNCJZ4QEhjiFlAnNSkfJh1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Audiovisuelles","origin_country":""},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/9tW5wZEGotn1Ei5pErA88m47XiD.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Hats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Bozzuffi","original_name":"Marcel Bozzuffi","popularity":0.4018,"profile_path":"/m1U5WSvkhfqJx00jPKvZXXuAk0p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rouchon","credit_id":"5b2ad7580e0a264801001c76","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Ford","original_name":"Mick Ford","popularity":0.1745,"profile_path":"/595XhmvAkkQNLDTtH0mRtFKogGk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chapin","credit_id":"5b2ad7d0925141707d001ee4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Lachens","original_name":"Catherine Lachens","popularity":0.2464,"profile_path":"/oyQfoj6pAiqWgsu6tNVCMoN8fu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"5b2ad7e4c3a3683e27001f4a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21273,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gérard Sterin","original_name":"Gérard Sterin","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d19fc6532acb00508ba459","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Ortega","original_name":"Pascal Ortega","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ce5dc89251415471001873","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Ford","original_name":"Mick Ford","popularity":0.1745,"profile_path":"/595XhmvAkkQNLDTtH0mRtFKogGk.jpg","credit_id":"5b2ad81b0e0a264825001f06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069055,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Hickson","original_name":"Robert Hickson","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2ad85f0e0a26480e0020fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":415820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Héros","original_name":"Pierre Héros","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2ad87d92514170ad0024ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1286775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernard Lorain","original_name":"Bernard Lorain","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2ad890925141707b001f2d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069060,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Kelly","original_name":"Chris Kelly","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2ad9460e0a264822001fe5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2069056,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeff Cohen","original_name":"Jeff Cohen","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/eMXUFNCT14gpBswYqbYnJn0WggL.jpg","credit_id":"66af67ee7443f27979bda9ed","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0083553","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jtNB7LNCJZ4QEhjiFlAnNSkfJh1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
