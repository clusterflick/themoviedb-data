One of the brothers is wheelchair-bound and eventually makes the acquaintance of the pizza-driving aspirant and decides to give him the money he needs -- though this act of generosity in no way shields him from his own destiny. Other characters wander in and out of the story, such as Jeanne (Martine Kalayan), the young man's lover.","popularity":0.2585,"poster_path":"/wwhkxtO3BdnLX6XD1wbq8UiEcya.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Arquebuse","origin_country":""},{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films A2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Side Roads","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Wilson","original_name":"Georges Wilson","popularity":0.3423,"profile_path":"/hifU1QhRKnX44VyrRBHmPldTsRy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Charles","credit_id":"57ce69f592514154ca001d22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rufus","original_name":"Rufus","popularity":0.3064,"profile_path":"/aC6rEJrBgCNjeG6vetJPBdgj5h3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cyprien","credit_id":"57ce6a03c3a36806520002b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Marcon","original_name":"André Marcon","popularity":0.1901,"profile_path":"/tQFEk49npJO1XHh4OfSAjCfQTIz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"57ce6a1292514119ce0002e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martine Kalayan","original_name":"Martine Kalayan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jeanne","credit_id":"57ce6a23c3a3682d8c001af8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Maurier","original_name":"Claire Maurier","popularity":0.2548,"profile_path":"/rlMYKpiTIzZCw2ee3YGENJZQKPC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marthe","credit_id":"57ce6a2d9251416100001781","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Drillaud","original_name":"Christian Drillaud","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jlQ93AuTpCKud3UjKOwUU7EWwCG.jpg","credit_id":"57ce696792514119f300025d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Drillaud","original_name":"Christian Drillaud","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jlQ93AuTpCKud3UjKOwUU7EWwCG.jpg","credit_id":"6781fae078cfcd77ed4e84ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9747,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Claude Carrière","original_name":"Jean-Claude Carrière","popularity":0.4408,"profile_path":"/aBHANidKViiyTFj5JeMyrvp3l8x.jpg","credit_id":"6781faf46056586f6c4e69f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Féret","original_name":"René Féret","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":"/2OHYxffneVvR9kpncbPH5O6UaXY.jpg","credit_id":"6781fb043881c79419bb8b9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26019,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean Musy","original_name":"Jean Musy","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/ldXwCwUw9ooljd7Z6X95H2qFj2w.jpg","credit_id":"6781fb14bd793c03544e5a3a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16732,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eduardo Serra","original_name":"Eduardo Serra","popularity":0.1451,"profile_path":"/ocove8OZVCQOKScZXyCaCKRSEaX.jpg","credit_id":"6781fb20ed679e53f87b4b11","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christiane Lack","original_name":"Christiane Lack","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781fb491431e0591abb503c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810195,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alix Comte","original_name":"Alix Comte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781fb5ced679e53f87b4b37","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0297194","wikidata_id":"Q3155948","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1602,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wwhkxtO3BdnLX6XD1wbq8UiEcya.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1068}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
