No interviews, no observations, no recalling memories. There's just footage of whatever happened as it was happening: it takes the viewer from initial concept to casting, rehearsals, costume fittings, creating disfigured bodies, dialogue replacement, editing, composing... If that's not enough, there are, on the same DVD, shorter segments on the creation of 1920s Paris and the zeppelin explosion.","popularity":0.1375,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Year at the Front: Behind the Scenes of 'A Very Long Engagement'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0461412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
