He searches for the source, and discovers a caste of street performers, eking out a modest living. We see individuals and groups, old and young, snake charmers and those hired to sing at family celebrations. A few talk about their lives and refute accusations of kidnapping lodged against the caste. A troupe of women sing at a party for a pregnant woman - they are saucy and blunt, encouraging and sisterly.","popularity":0.1501,"poster_path":"/7qDS3lHhuntzQsSKPd12fOJfTfI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merchant Ivory Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Street Musicians of Bombay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54449,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Robbins","original_name":"Richard Robbins","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/634oscxISN6V0t8PgfG21BiFotM.jpg","credit_id":"57d0aef6c3a3684b3e001926","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wahid Chowhan","original_name":"Wahid Chowhan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c0cc45df86a800e77fe403","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54448,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ismail Merchant","original_name":"Ismail Merchant","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/8tL8R8eOhjEFQyEg8uXA8GBNwoA.jpg","credit_id":"64c0cc52ede1b0011f7d6df5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":110719,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amit Bose","original_name":"Amit Bose","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c0cc6613a32000ad4dfe3b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jehangir Choudhary","original_name":"Jehangir Choudhary","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c0cc722f1be000ae4b7be3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0258988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7qDS3lHhuntzQsSKPd12fOJfTfI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
