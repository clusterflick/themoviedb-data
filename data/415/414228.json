Within a week after crossing the border, his reputation falls from a respected global political figure to an infamous communist spy. During a five-year-long trial, he was arrested and held in custody. This throws Korean society into turmoil and brings a big conflict between the Conservative and the Progressive parties. The filmmaker calmly contemplates this long period of the incident in detail and depicts a society with an indifferent manner. The story builds through an accretion of whimsical facts and it sometimes brings up uncomfortable truths which will irritate viewers. This film is a camera inside of us that evokes what viewers may have tried to forget.","popularity":0.69,"poster_path":"/sN0aOPJwZDLNM8g7yjWAMKHkXBw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2010-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Border City 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4460352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Song Du-yul","original_name":"Song Du-yul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6593e71251a64e03b5f4c1b9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2193245,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyo Yong-soo","original_name":"Pyo Yong-soo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62751a28a313b82f75835216","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1701051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hong Hyung-sook","original_name":"홍형숙","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sd42uyVFtUtwn6ukgCgQodWV13N.jpg","credit_id":"581454bb925141543e02ef85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoon Seong-hye","original_name":"Yoon Seong-hye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619f0d269eb90017cb7ba7c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294473,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hong Yoon-jeong","original_name":"Hong Yoon-jeong","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d553310e8131d3e34894a3a","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1519657","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/sN0aOPJwZDLNM8g7yjWAMKHkXBw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1476,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/458yMxiZktPf2h4ESkpwqJaHKhw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":173686,"name":"red scare"},{"id":267761,"name":"inter-korean relations"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pusan International Film Festival","release_date":"2009-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
