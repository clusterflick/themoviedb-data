We get to follow his performance at the Studentski Kulturni Centar, Novi Sad, visit the cult station of Radio B92, a conversation at the apartment and finally the never presented staff from the Popovača Hospital. In 1991, Čuljak joined the Croatian army in the Croatian War of Independence. He died in 1992 while still a Croatian soldier. The cause of his death is unknown. It is rumored that he died after slipping and accidentally discharging the gun he was carrying.","popularity":0.065,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63904,"logo_path":"/fKDAYIJat7fpbWnjgdHchpg5AbQ.png","name":"Fakultet Dramskih Umetnosti Beograd (FDU)","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":185953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moj film","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satan Panonski: Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satan Panonski","original_name":"Satan Panonski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57cca90dc3a36830a0004ee7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milorad Milinković","original_name":"Milorad Milinković","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/a3TdOI6crA6H70OAxqhHZqFRHNQ.jpg","credit_id":"654a86371ac2927b2dcf0384","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milorad Milinković","original_name":"Milorad Milinković","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/a3TdOI6crA6H70OAxqhHZqFRHNQ.jpg","credit_id":"57cca8cec3a36830a5004f2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4611061,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dragan Stiglić","original_name":"Dragan Stiglić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ff67af90fca3017da1da98","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153113,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nikola Sekerić","original_name":"Nikola Sekerić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ff679160620a017c2bc278","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3599565,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dragan Zulovic","original_name":"Dragan Zulovic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ff67cb0c1255017e0edf55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27850341","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
