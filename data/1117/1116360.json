Shabby Road is where the band recorded most of their music, and it is the name of an album by The Rutles, released on 26 September 1969, their last recorded album, but not last released (Let It Rot). Tracks 9-17 form a medley sometimes noted as one song called \"The Shabby Road Medley\". Tracks 14-16 are sometimes noted as one song called \"The Bronze Blunders Medley\". On the cover, Stig is depicted without trousers. This was one of the key \"clues\" which inspired the 'Stig is dead' conspiracy theory, which still lasts today in some circles. Stig later referenced these theories on his life album, Stig is not a wax replica please stop asking.","popularity":0.4205,"poster_path":"/7rYXWIxuNwA7g1H6QpJZH0ks6bK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Shabby Road: The Music of 'The Rutles'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Innes","original_name":"Neil Innes","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/xKAs77iIppfUMfW6HhGT6YVfon4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"644316d5cee2f604c9364153","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Halsey","original_name":"John Halsey","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64431711b3f6f504c89e2a66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Fataar","original_name":"Ricky Fataar","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/bfma8oVsNukuaPlJZF29hd5FETN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64431780b3f6f502fc9e2544","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Palin","original_name":"Michael Palin","popularity":1.0055,"profile_path":"/7qCp6M2NxMWpUmO2t6IqHGNlBjz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6443178fad87f704c1cc8b5f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231063,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Cregan","original_name":"John Cregan","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443169ecee2f6049f363197","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1429459","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":993,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3iSjH8t7FpANofPct4H8e3FNG63.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1766}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7rYXWIxuNwA7g1H6QpJZH0ks6bK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yeZWOqejL3Gb825BgWLjhcsJUCZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
