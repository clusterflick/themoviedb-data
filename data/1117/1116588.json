When film productions stop and cinemas are closing. In this new restricted world of his, he spends his time going through his rich film archive and calls directors and actors around the whole world: Isabella Rossellini, John Sayles, Oliver Assayas and many more. A film about the film's ability to travel into other worlds and give us the strength to endure our own difficult existence.","popularity":0.3652,"poster_path":"/3eXcJjYdYCM0z9wszJ66ALLuxKn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Amid a global pandemic, an entrepreneur looks back on his life's work owning and operating an idiosyncratic cinema in the forest of northern Ontario.","title":"The Movie Man","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"电影超人","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4023264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Stata","original_name":"Keith Stata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Keith Stata","credit_id":"6443e496cee2f604f336bb5e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4023255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Finlin","original_name":"Matt Finlin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443e421a06efe059ea49715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4023257,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Barzilay","original_name":"Karen Barzilay","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443e438cee2f604c936bd84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4023258,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ania Smolenskaia","original_name":"Ania Smolenskaia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443e44eb3f6f504c89e980f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Yates","original_name":"James Yates","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443e475a06efe05c4a49dfa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21916284","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q1FdXm76XoodjescPwYxha4sIRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":2946,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3eXcJjYdYCM0z9wszJ66ALLuxKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/rOfxRL3xx9QNG5hAFDoOxo7Uo8R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TCM","release_date":"2024-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"2024 SBIFF Trailer - The Movie Man","key":"I7FQgwvTJTc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-17T05:43:46.000Z","id":"6716c1dcdcb7ff811e47552b"}]}}}
