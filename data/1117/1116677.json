The news of her father's death reaches the three people who lived in the Kamakura house left by her grandmother.  And she will welcome a “half-sister” left by her father, who had been separated from her when she was young.","popularity":0.3496,"poster_path":"/nBtb3iLeMIxWCPL0IoIzqrVOccL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kamakura Diary","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Umimachi Diary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2582372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mio Hanana","original_name":"花奈澪","popularity":0.1839,"profile_path":"/8qIHn2MlYSUE8WFYIHhjgpsvhh6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"644427af651fcf04889d518a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2632198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maasa Sudo","original_name":"須藤茉麻","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/8lAlAqABFyofS4icfdL1vDgYelt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6444286eb3f6f5049c9ea643","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4023684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Goto","original_name":"Moe Goto","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"644428cca06efe05c4a4c770","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3738220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kano Fujihira","original_name":"Kano Fujihira","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":"/sskDCxpBkWUfOobr9vJcSJs2538.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64442932651fcf04889d51d6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshiyuki Morioka","original_name":"森岡利行","popularity":0.2545,"profile_path":"/6FqgCXboCysNmTqS0Kis3bJIYyZ.jpg","credit_id":"6444276dd35dea0505fbb834","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshiyuki Morioka","original_name":"森岡利行","popularity":0.2545,"profile_path":"/6FqgCXboCysNmTqS0Kis3bJIYyZ.jpg","credit_id":"64442779d35dea0481fbbf98","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nBtb3iLeMIxWCPL0IoIzqrVOccL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":734}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
