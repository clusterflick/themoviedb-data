Both words come from “Arkhé”, the Greek word for “origin”.  In the ruins of buildings, lost forever by earthquakes, as in the depth of the archives, we dig.  What happened the morning of the big earthquake? The morning of September 19th 1985 is fading away in our memories. These recordings have never been seen. Unedited images of the catastrophe dug out by the archaeological adventure of an archivist that suffered with them. He dug and suffered until he could no longer see.","popularity":0.5073,"poster_path":"/dIVhM6UTAmEy8n7FITVudqEhg7J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194243,"logo_path":"/fmX3vUQsZIncHOeLJSeBcAqVyCu.png","name":"N+","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2023-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the ruins of buildings, lost forever by earthquakes, as in the depth of the archives, we dig.","title":"Arkhé","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trinidad Ferreiro","original_name":"Trinidad Ferreiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6442d496b3f6f502fc9e15fd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ahidee Centeno","original_name":"Ahidee Centeno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6442d4e3cee2f602fb36285f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022266,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolás Ruiz","original_name":"Nicolás Ruiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6442d4d9fcec2e04bdd9aa97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3936132,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Badía","original_name":"Daniel Badía","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6442d505e2bca80509437dfb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022268,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"José Luis Leguízamo","original_name":"José Luis Leguízamo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6442d4f3d35dea0505fb16dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4022263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armando Navarro","original_name":"Armando Navarro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/38o8NUGIc8gMDSjQyMtnWlMd1Y2.jpg","credit_id":"6442e15b651fcf045e9cbd37","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4022263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armando Navarro","original_name":"Armando Navarro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/38o8NUGIc8gMDSjQyMtnWlMd1Y2.jpg","credit_id":"6442d4a9651fcf02fb9cb286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4022263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armando Navarro","original_name":"Armando Navarro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/38o8NUGIc8gMDSjQyMtnWlMd1Y2.jpg","credit_id":"6442e14a651fcf02fb9cb647","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dIVhM6UTAmEy8n7FITVudqEhg7J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":964}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":534,"name":"mexico"},{"id":1547,"name":"mexico city, mexico"},{"id":3521,"name":"earthquake"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":236282,"name":"mexican history"},{"id":239463,"name":"film archives"},{"id":316423,"name":"arkhé"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arkhé english trailer.mov","key":"818915895","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-18T22:17:16.000Z","id":"6442d5ddcee2f6049f3621b3"}]}}}
