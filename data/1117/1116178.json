Jaxon Whittington directs “Pink Wings,” a pulpy, mysterious fever-dream filled with religious imagery and 'west coast drifter' style. In a black and red dress and white cowboy boots, a young woman listens as her grandfather tells the story of his repeating nightmare — driving through Malibu Canyon, he spots a bloodied man screaming for help on the side of the road, and in an instant, must decide whether to help or flee. The dream comes in various forms but the cowboy can’t shake the images from his head, even in waking life. Later, when Ruby goes to see her mother, a hidden truth about the dream comes to light. Brimming with Lynchian atmosphere, Whittington’s film is intriguing and melodramatic, built around two striking characters captured in vivid color.","popularity":0.473,"poster_path":"/mJqwNYNDAIcLG4HYKcxs5LY9qSb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jaxon Whittington Productions
