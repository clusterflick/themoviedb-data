She is haunted by her previous relationship with Walter, the father of Darwin, her son. Habit, comfort and suppression make her numb and loveless. Her fleeting romantic adventures with other men are not enough to push her away from this uncertain equilibrium. The only thing that seems to make sense in her life is little Darwin, who shines a light in her life.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/rVMeQtLfxH9zcdfx7IIhExYsdc2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cristina","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3698418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rossana Montoya","original_name":"Rossana Montoya","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6444acf905822402fb330a1b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Julián Garcés","original_name":"Cristina Julián Garcés","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6444ad03d38b5804a3117967","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Cantave François","original_name":"Walter Cantave François","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6444ad0c651fcf02fb9d8484","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darwin Juan Lugo Quebrada","original_name":"Darwin Juan Lugo Quebrada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6444ad192c6b7b05127eccea","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Fresen","original_name":"Hans Fresen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6444acd4b3f6f5049c9ed04b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Fresen","original_name":"Hans Fresen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6444abc92c6b7b04be7ecb3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024208,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrés Mossos","original_name":"Andrés Mossos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6444acb3d35dea0455fbf3ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3978549,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mauricio Reyes","original_name":"Mauricio Reyes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6444acc7d38b5805211179b7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1585705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Sebastián Quebrada","original_name":"Juan Sebastián Quebrada","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wJE7vpDPXsGlZvoAvCpnIlPbOfU.jpg","credit_id":"6444ace4a06efe0552a51f74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3698418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rossana Montoya","original_name":"Rossana Montoya","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6444ac73b3f6f5055a9ee5dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Fresen","original_name":"Hans Fresen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6444abe5651fcf04b29d90c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1114,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rVMeQtLfxH9zcdfx7IIhExYsdc2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer Cristina","key":"734536261","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-28T22:51:51.000Z","id":"6444ab9dcee2f604c9371947"}]}}}
