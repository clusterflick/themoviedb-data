With their stilt-like legs and long mobile trunk, joined to the body of a large shrew with a golden bottom, they certainly deserve their name - though they are related to neither elephant not shrew! This shy, endangered creature has become the mascot of Kenya’s beautiful Arabuko National Park. The income they attract via tourism pays for the education of local children. The elephant shrew has truly become the Spirit of the Forest.","popularity":0.2398,"poster_path":"/fXmQ3iiiOtZ2D28bysHjju0e9EV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86010,"logo_path":"/oRImGo0AVFXGirn8aLMDzHY5t6I.png","name":"Taglicht Media","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":84339,"logo_path":"/xHTkcQihsN49kgVZNWEHT4omGym.png","name":"ZDF Enterprises","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainforest Pixies: The Mysterious Rhynchocyon Shrew of Arabuko","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le mystérieux rongeur à tête d'éléphant","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rainforest Pixies: The Mysterious Rhynchocyon Shrew of Arabuko","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp Schepmann","original_name":"Philipp Schepmann","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":"/hINSI3YcDsi4xcNCRCQ3oCPKVAN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6779a91bf6bc9716e8725d67","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Ostwald","original_name":"Herbert Ostwald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1Y2S7l3so5WE4KOMLe8ft4RGbP5.jpg","credit_id":"644255cdfcec2e02fcd98263","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Ostwald","original_name":"Herbert Ostwald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1Y2S7l3so5WE4KOMLe8ft4RGbP5.jpg","credit_id":"6779a92c4bf0f0e3b474882c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975481,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Joggerst","original_name":"Mark Joggerst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779a948f6bc9716e8725d75","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roland Gockel","original_name":"Roland Gockel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779a95af6bc9716e8725d79","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4609065,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Norbert Röttcher","original_name":"Norbert Röttcher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779a96f816b2810d166c5bb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave D.
