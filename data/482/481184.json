My concern in a nut shell, is for the future of humanity.","popularity":0.1562,"poster_path":"/yPEwTakUU72BIBFPxgTrQt862VQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time to Play","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Blanning","original_name":"Adam Blanning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - MD","credit_id":"59e223df92514172bb016c18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joy Winchell","original_name":"Joy Winchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself - MEd","credit_id":"59e223fac3a3680e01015bf7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Hunter","original_name":"Kim Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e223c4c3a3680df1017f40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2379,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yPEwTakUU72BIBFPxgTrQt862VQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1586}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":238606,"name":"waldorf education"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TIME TO PLAY - film trailer","key":"_RasrbkPNPc","published_at":"2014-12-05T21:32:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59e220a1c3a3680df1017a7b"}]}}}
