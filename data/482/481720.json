The film portrays the interaction between the past and the present, layering images and sounds, creating a collaged experience of Kingsway. Architectural signs and symbols overpower the foreground evoking the automotive scale, but present-day buildings and spaces re ect a changing vernacular as portrayed by the street’s soundscape and the road’s new sense of place.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kingsway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Chong","original_name":"Jeffrey Chong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e57cabc3a368655d0022cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Premiere","release_date":"2017-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
