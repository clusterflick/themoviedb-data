Growing up deaf and gay in a family of hearing people, Cohen never felt at home and always felt alone. That feeling of estrangement was exacerbated during his adolescence by the sudden death of his mother and the subsequent rift with his father as the family scattered in different directions. Cohen creates a sense of family with a small group of friends, including his best friend, Yaeli, a deaf woman. While he wants a child and a life partner, he fears that he won’t find the right man in the small deaf community in his “sweet little country.” Sharing a desire with Yaeli to be parents, the new “couple” decide to have a child in a shared parenting arrangement.","popularity":0.5698,"poster_path":"/jwMsMCeL8dXmLdZqHC2zk9vkj6E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2017-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sign for Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Sinal do Amor","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Ech Mesamnim Hahva","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elad Cohen","original_name":"Elad Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e27c0c925141635c004f93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iris Ben Moshe","original_name":"Iris Ben Moshe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb764969251410ddd026039","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iris Ben Moshe","original_name":"Iris Ben Moshe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb7649f0e0a263393026d57","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elad Cohen","original_name":"Elad Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb764a90e0a26338b028e72","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14482104","wikidata_id":"Q66729130","facebook_id":"THESIGNFORLOVE","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3oPVZF70ZJyx0vn6WSZgRmMyrZQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/jwMsMCeL8dXmLdZqHC2zk9vkj6E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1643,"name":"deaf"},{"id":10235,"name":"family relationships"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2017-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Side By Side International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Sign for Love – Trailer – SFF 18","key":"JyZCupyjzIA","published_at":"2018-05-21T01:08:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bb7644f0e0a2633a30266de"}]}}}
