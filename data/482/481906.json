During the height of the White Terror in the 1950s, thousands of suspected Communists and subversives were arrested; many of them simply disappeared forever. In 1993 a forgotten graveyard of 201 unclaimed victims was rediscovered at Liuzhangli on the outskirts of Taipei. Experimental filmmaker Lin Hsin-I’s Letter #69 explores the violence and injustice that still haunt Taiwan today through the letters of Shi Shui Huan, a political prisoner during the White Terror—all the way up to her last letter before being executed, a blank piece of paper.-UCLAFilm&TV","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/lKvTdd74x1wvxorE9bdKMWzRrjJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2016-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter #69","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lin I-Huang","original_name":"Lin I-Huang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59e6c794c3a368133e005ae5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lin Hung Su-Chin","original_name":"Lin Hung Su-Chin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59e6c79ec3a368131b0057ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuo Chia-ling","original_name":"Kuo Chia-ling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59e6c7a79251416f1600369a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lin Hsin-I","original_name":"Lin Hsin-I","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e6c7899251413bd500590c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lin Hsin-I","original_name":"Lin Hsin-I","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b74561492514168b6135638","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lin Hsin-I","original_name":"Lin Hsin-I","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b74562192514140541b161f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lin Hsin-I","original_name":"Lin Hsin-I","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b74562f92514103410cf291","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2klNtp16a1th3E3OfMs3UDhnJB2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lKvTdd74x1wvxorE9bdKMWzRrjJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i5RY5P2uXdOrvYrLz4w3KpUkwAd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Women Make Waves Taiwan","release_date":"2016-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Los Angeles","release_date":"2017-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"[BISFF 2017] 69번째 편지 - 트레일러 Letter #69 - trailer","key":"5wumP2oOzq8","published_at":"2017-03-23T04:31:28.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59f478939251414d05011550"}]}}}
