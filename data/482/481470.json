He was made Journalist of the Year and International Reporter of the Year for his reporting of the Vietnam War over a period of almost ten years.  In 1995’s ‘Vietnam: The Last Battle’, Pilger returns to Vietnam to review those twenty years, seeking to rescue something of Vietnamese past and present from Hollywood images which pitied the invader while overshadowing one of the most epic struggles of the 20th century.  And with the embargo on the country now lifted by President Clinton, he describes Vietnam's latest battle against the economic plunder of the country by the United States and other powerful countries","popularity":0.0734,"poster_path":"/gOXk5sWA8mWdY8KysVfbzmV8yed.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vietnam: The Last Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"659171d96aa8e06153eb5b00","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Munro","original_name":"David Munro","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659171ef1dcb776b1945567a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","credit_id":"659171f96aa8e06153eb5b13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Munro","original_name":"David Munro","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6591720c028f147694c5b976","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6370014","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gOXk5sWA8mWdY8KysVfbzmV8yed.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
