At dawn on January 25, 2015, thirteen men of the Special Action Force (SAF) attacked the hut where Marwan lived in Mamasapano. The SAF successfully terminated him.  This documentary gives us unprecedented access to OPLAN EXODUS, the special operation that took out one of the FBI's most wanted. With never before seen interviews, footage of the actual fighting itself, and dramatic reenactments by elite members of the Special Action Force, we reveal the men mourned by an entire nation. We discover the impact of the SAF's work, and the significance of eliminating the terrorist, Marwan - the man behing the Bali Bombing, the Australian Embassy Bombing (2004) and the JW Market & Ritz Calton Bombing (2009)  And in the end as 44 caskets were laid to rest we ask, was it all worth it?","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":"/7PMyCG9jv71ScIENAoluhkeUYym.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caelestis Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2017-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Untold Story of the Gallant SAF44","title":"Fallen Not Forgotten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933377,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Belic","original_name":"Adrian Belic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e23d68c3a3680e25018b45","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933377,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Belic","original_name":"Adrian Belic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e23d57c3a3680e01017bc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905654,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Jo Bellosillo","original_name":"Sally Jo Bellosillo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e23d49925141726901a2f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905658,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pamela Carbonell","original_name":"Pamela Carbonell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e23db4c3a3680df101a297","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905654,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Jo Bellosillo","original_name":"Sally Jo Bellosillo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e23ddc925141726901a3be","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile Guertin","original_name":"Emile Guertin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e23d79c3a3680de4019b01","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168049,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Charena Escala","original_name":"Charena Escala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e23da3c3a3680dbf017a82","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905659,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Atty.
