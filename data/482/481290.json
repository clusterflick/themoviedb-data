Yiming wants to find beauty around him and wants to use nostalgia to explore the confusion of modern urban people. The old artist Xu Lao, who is engaged in root carving, suggested Yiming and him go to the mountains to observe the simplicity and rural spirit of the people in the mountains. Yiming fulfilled the old man's will and went to Dashan and opened his own film exhibition.
