A group of Estonians, including young woman Agnes and her mother, Agnes’s friend engineer Karl Raudsepp and his fiancee Erna, are waiting for permission to return to Estonia. Love, however, won’t ask about people’s plans, poor conditions nor general atmosphere of violence. The mutual feelings between Karl and Agnes make Erna so jealous that she will make a false complaint about Agnes to Cheka. Agnes’s beauty hypnotizes both Tchekist Commissar Miroschtschenko and secret agent Hevelyn – both of them make up their minds that they must win the girl’s heart.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/279Tgnyfn8xvXw6uSu81spoacFV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eesti National Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1925-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheka Commissar Miroschtschenko","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Tscheka-Kommissar Miroschtschenko","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","title":"Tšekaa komissar Miroštšenko","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduard Pütsep","original_name":"Eduard Pütsep","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tsilikov","credit_id":"59e5f9b2925141026500abb2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalju Raag","original_name":"Kalju Raag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Karl Raudsepp","credit_id":"59e5f9c2c3a36865cc00b36c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentine Vassiljeva","original_name":"Valentine Vassiljeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59e5f9d3925141026500abd7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Silber","original_name":"Ella Silber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff559301443f40041f94d5f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Puhov","original_name":"Leonid Puhov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff5594708cf870040b3d31f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leoniide Jürisson","original_name":"Leoniide Jürisson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff55953f056d5003ef81087","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mihkel Lepper","original_name":"Mihkel Lepper","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff559636d4c97003e077ce7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niina Ormus","original_name":"Niina Ormus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff559767e9d5f00403237bf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Hindrea","original_name":"Alfred Hindrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff5597e245dbe003e2f82fa","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sehnert","original_name":"Paul Sehnert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e5f907c3a36865cc00b2bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572604,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rudolf Unt","original_name":"Rudolf Unt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e74f0d5357c0000194c9302","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nikolai Root","original_name":"Nikolai Root","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e74f0e8b7d3520011769e3d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212569","wikidata_id":"Q2465397","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/279Tgnyfn8xvXw6uSu81spoacFV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
