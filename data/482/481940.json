This artistic revolution was led by directors, actors, technicians and poets. They are the characters and voices of our film. The Soviet Actress, Ada Voistik, and its camrades tell us the story of this unique period, through the images of soviet fic-tional works produced between 1917 and 1934. We can thus catch a glimpse of their fight for a new society, where creative freedom was of utmost im-portance. A utopia which will be brought down by an authoritarian power impacting cinema as much as the rest of society.","popularity":0.1908,"poster_path":"/tloNOloQraAh04eZZ9CWCuWt9uI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53693,"logo_path":"/wqClBYEzL4bc1TG5FLxhgvmQe5L.png","name":"Les Poissons Volants","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Soviet Revolution Told Through its Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Russian Revolution Through Its Films","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Russian Revolution Through Its Films","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginie Efira","original_name":"Virginie Efira","popularity":1.6718,"profile_path":"/sJFBDkZ2AMAkQBsSZricrUnZv50.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"641df5018de0ae00d9014f77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Legrand","original_name":"Xavier Legrand","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/JtP2bXg55rLMcGaMgEibRgzj2z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"641df509344a8e0083603717","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damien Chapelle","original_name":"Damien Chapelle","popularity":0.2624,"profile_path":"/djuyCmp6QldjoDNoX0SuO8dyYpd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"641df51666a0d300d7d0d4df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurélien Recoing","original_name":"Aurélien Recoing","popularity":0.3379,"profile_path":"/qFWdIxvq6csxuso0PSiOV6rx49i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"641df524e1faed009c96fff0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Salinger","original_name":"Emmanuel Salinger","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/fc9sL0ZOLOu57Rc6i3qdK14JxTb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"641df52bc99826008300f498","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Cheysson","original_name":"Thomas Cheysson","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641df53766a0d30099253626","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2227313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Hamon","original_name":"Emmanuel Hamon","popularity":0.059,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6d9d4e4b576002035c5e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6100294","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":816,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tloNOloQraAh04eZZ9CWCuWt9uI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":544},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":895,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/bckABEzmClcHsyDg817BwPqioYb.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":597},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":902,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vwtqxu74CQguMgjfW1gZWTATNHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte","release_date":"2017-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte","release_date":"2017-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
