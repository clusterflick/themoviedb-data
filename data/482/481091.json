The seasons change, and so does the music, transforming the mundane into the hypnotic. The love that they sing of is also a metaphor for the need for the other – the friend, the family, the community, to build a polyphony of voices. Stories of love, stories of the field, stories of song, stories in song. Up down and sideways is a musical portrait of a community of rice cultivators and their memories of love and loss, created from working together on the fields.","popularity":0.0634,"poster_path":"/rIyR4GcXR1r5MlAN6nlN0jaaXsA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up Down & Sideways","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Em todos os lados","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Up Down & Sideways","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iswar Srikumar","original_name":"Iswar Srikumar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e16b109251417261006b6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anushka Meenakshi","original_name":"Anushka Meenakshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e16b2dc3a3680de40072b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7633170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rIyR4GcXR1r5MlAN6nlN0jaaXsA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kho ki pa lü / Up Down and Sideways TRAILER","key":"zJsCbJfICoY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-20T05:32:49.000Z","id":"5d2c9fa60745e14ab0783a1b"}]}}}
