Their story concentrates, as in a lens, the extensive experience of people living under occupation. The difficulties, which affect this family, are experienced by the larger community and evolve extreme emotions. The main motive of the film is not the regime and the occupation itself, but its consequences, how it affects the lives of ordinary people who simply want to live, to love and to have a family.","popularity":0.1387,"poster_path":"/mTcP709E1duIIxzfyb7VR7SxuCv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117526,"logo_path":"/iKueQHLIkBg9NsBHV09z2srKu2B.png","name":"Belsat TV","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":94805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Everest","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2016-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tatar","iso_639_1":"tt","name":""},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Will This Wind Stop","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"When Will This Wind Stop","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Quando este vento parar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237030,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksander Pozdnyakov","original_name":"Aleksander Pozdnyakov","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66017b82770700017c0f604e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aniela Astrid Gabryel","original_name":"Aniela Astrid Gabryel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e4b77dc3a368466802e02e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aniela Astrid Gabryel","original_name":"Aniela Astrid Gabryel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50c631c7a2c83e89ec0ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852271,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Ogneva","original_name":"Victoria Ogneva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50ff7c7e07734329ec373","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3860729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tymoteusz Witczak","original_name":"Tymoteusz Witczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50f745e236beb57c62f4f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852265,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Teresa Pietracha","original_name":"Teresa Pietracha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50fabacdc6cdafab14769","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852266,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zurab Kochayaschvilli","original_name":"Zurab Kochayaschvilli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50fbdfce607a83e19cdf4","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852270,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Akhtem Amzayev","original_name":"Akhtem Amzayev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50fda680969176407a2f6","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3262828,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katarzyna Boniecka","original_name":"Katarzyna Boniecka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50f09e50b5a1762676457","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852268,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ivanna Balagura","original_name":"Ivanna Balagura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a50fcbacdc6cdafab14773","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68556,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Per K.
