Can two people from completely different worlds find love? These are some of the questions raised in 'China Affair.' A Chinese movie filmed from a non-Chinese perspective, 'China Affair' is a complex narrative laced with barbed satire, which allows for a fresh perspective unseen in other movies that touch upon the cultural gap between America and China. At first glance, Director Zhang Ming is simply bringing cultural differences to life through the eyes of a foreigner named Lucas, but actually Zhang Ming's 'China Affair' is a story about difficult relationships that reflects on larger issues facing an increasingly intercultural world.","popularity":0.1147,"poster_path":"/nRWmnQoBFUc9he2Pa2J92b90SlK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2012-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"China Affair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Burkart","original_name":"Philip Burkart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lucas","credit_id":"59e285ccc3a3687c6000552c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1905866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dai Ruqian","original_name":"Dai Ruqian","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Wang Hong","credit_id":"59e285d492514163b9005a74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Hei","original_name":"Liu Hei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59e285f3c3a3687c28005d46","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3818371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"邹琼帝","original_name":"邹琼帝","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Li Hong","credit_id":"638f77bd196757026ca54ed1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131244,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Qin Haiyan","original_name":"Qin Haiyan","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/ohNvAJBi0yrXfGcieeMPCQGK0gK.jpg","credit_id":"638f781804733f00e36464e8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Ming","original_name":"Zhang Ming","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":"/9RMIGaC4oUb4dm7RtnCl5bIH1TS.jpg","credit_id":"59e285acc3a3687c5000600f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wang Meng","original_name":"Wang Meng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e25ccef5ed8e9001562fd08","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2250773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xi Liao","original_name":"Xi Liao","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e25ccd721c4ca0013f90658","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3060918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1527,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nRWmnQoBFUc9he2Pa2J92b90SlK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
