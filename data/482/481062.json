While her charming irresponsible brother continued his questionable pursuits, Sissy stepped in to take care of their parents' antique shop, their home and the family cat Horatio. With her own life at a screeching halt, Sissy begins to fill 11 secret journals with the exciting adventures of daring, bold women she imagines she could be. Now her 27th birthday is just days away and Sissy decides to fill her 12th journal with the adventures of her real life - but much to her dismay, she has absolutely nothing to write about. Then one afternoon, an intriguing young performance artist walks into Sissy's shop and their chance encounter leads Sissy to face a tough choice - to remain safely cocooned in her fantasy lives or to take a chance and discover what her real life might become","popularity":0.4382,"poster_path":"/srHA2J9wDaapqEnwVZmwLfDVDE2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 12 Lives of Sissy Carlyle","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"April Billingsley","original_name":"April Billingsley","popularity":0.2214,"profile_path":"/l1mjOVk43USZ3pBrLtUX0WWEFAQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sissy Carlyle","credit_id":"59e10f12c3a368362200287a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Burkey","original_name":"Jason Burkey","popularity":0.2986,"profile_path":"/wdiwFFH5xSx8AquNFRSwL5lUH0J.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Riley Carlyle","credit_id":"59e10f2ac3a3683622002889","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":116464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Northrup","original_name":"Stephanie Northrup","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/zDggzWOzC8HJOik84Ay7KCYwvIu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stella Gilbert","credit_id":"59e10f50c3a368365e0027f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Mills","original_name":"Brad Mills","popularity":0.3796,"profile_path":"/f6O3Br2EygYU3jDTeN4vdki66qO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Elijah Bell","credit_id":"59e10f689251412ca6002966","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Ayres","original_name":"Morgan Ayres","popularity":0.1396,"profile_path":"/fA7OLAdJ6qppb5fxr3cfts49ptZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Will Brasselton","credit_id":"59e10f869251412cc40028a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1905181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenaya Cleveland","original_name":"Tenaya Cleveland","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/3u6933PJVf4HAFtMaGbuRbse714.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Rosemary Cross","credit_id":"59e10fb69251412cd10027d8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Phillips","original_name":"Desmond Phillips","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/xFcvzZkHfZ4Y1qjekfsQF4IrOaX.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bryce","credit_id":"59e10fd09251412cb9002938","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gordan","original_name":"John Gordan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Doug Yates","credit_id":"59e10ffac3a368364f002896","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1905183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen O'Reilly","original_name":"Allen O'Reilly","popularity":0.2349,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Asher Leyland","credit_id":"59e11016c3a368363a002ae6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerri J.
