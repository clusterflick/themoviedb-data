Forty years ago, that was not the case. How did we get here? Our film explores the dramatic history of modern Emergency Medicine, told by its maverick founders, in their own words. The historic take on the specialty allows us to contrast where Emergency Medicine is today with where it began, not too long ago.","popularity":0.9037,"poster_path":"/kW68rkCxABfKHi99UyBctdSYZUv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
