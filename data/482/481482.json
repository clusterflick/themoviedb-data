With unique interviews with Anne's step sister, Eva Schloss and Gillian Walnes, a survivor from Auschwitz who now runs the Anne Frank Trust in the UK and Ronald Leopold, the Director of the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.  In 1933, the Nazis rose to power. Five years later, in 1938, Eva Schloss remembers the Nazis marching on Austria and then she and her family fleeing and settling in Amsterdam the same year.
