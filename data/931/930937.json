T has a steady girlfriend named T, but things are not going well. The two meet in a park, where they meet Yoko, the singer of a folk group, and Yoko and K have a secret attraction. Meanwhile, T-girl is trying to get back together with her old boyfriend. In the midst of such a mundane group of high school students, T's malice and Yoko's sudden mistake. Some just stare at the blank time of grace in front of them. This film, produced by a large group of people, is a comedy with a high sense of humour and thoroughly sophisticated dialogue.","popularity":0.2219,"poster_path":"/dbRDaKUR8KgRmkBjWZvJpdgxdHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hyokoma Union","origin_country":""},{"id":170092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Group HOW","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"送春記","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reiko Inoue","original_name":"Reiko Inoue","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"620ed125c7a7e0006ba1327e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iwamitsu Kyohiro","original_name":"Iwamitsu Kyohiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"620ed12d7d5f4b001db155ab","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Kaneko","original_name":"金子功","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620ed0d7d100b6004196554d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431226,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fujie Takao","original_name":"Fujie Takao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620ed1104c2592001bbd232c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431223,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Takahashi Norihiko","original_name":"Takahashi Norihiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620ed0c9ca0e17001b3ec005","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2024553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshinori Sato","original_name":"Yoshinori Sato","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":"/sZe7gfCYx0fkKw1vqCjsK5JlFsx.jpg","credit_id":"620ed119f90b190044e523a7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hohbo Yoshiyoshi","original_name":"Hohbo Yoshiyoshi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620ed0bdd100b6001bd8e2ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431224,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Takarabo Yoshiyoshi","original_name":"Takarabo Yoshiyoshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620ed0e641465c001b7dcb7b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbRDaKUR8KgRmkBjWZvJpdgxdHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
