David is a bitter and cynical writer who struggled to make a name for himself as a filmmaker. A.J. was a promising actor who traded in his dreams of stardom for fatherhood. Once close friends, they have grown apart, each having taken a very different path with their life. Reunited over dinner, A.J. and David begin to reveal personal truths about their experiences that will put their friendship to the test. Written and produced by stars A Wone and David F. Walker, and inspired by the works of Charles Burnett, John Cassavettes and Louis Malle, My Dinner with A.J. is an irreverent and intimate look at a friendship ravaged by time.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Dinner With A.J.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliana Tobon","original_name":"Juliana Tobon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Waitress","credit_id":"61ed8b071ad93b00430d8a5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.J.
