Cecile, the beautiful bride, rushes to her fiance and instantly falls in love with an unknown man on the street, who soon turns out to be Sándor, her much-talked-about boyfriend and witness. According to the moral standards of the time, nothing can come of this love, since Sándor is an unbridled knight, whose perception excludes any relationship between Cecile and him. Although Sándor continues to visit the couple often, he also spends a lot of time abroad due to his raging emotions. Returning home from one of her trips, succumbing to rumours, Cecile feels that she is cheating on her husband. As befits a good friend, he enlightens Pál and confronts Cecile, the deceitful woman. But this is only the beginning of this story, which is full of twists and misunderstandings.","popularity":0.1448,"poster_path":"/2hQXEBkPALPelbLs9XSiQ8Rtbdz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kék róka","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emöke Zsigmond","original_name":"Emöke Zsigmond","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/y1HCYd55954WSnVjpXBAO1YbbkR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cecília","credit_id":"61edaa509e458601072f084f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1606637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dénes Száraz","original_name":"Dénes Száraz","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/qsabzFAZr1229UUFE2g6HujT26R.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sándor","credit_id":"61edaa656d4c97004310d77d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2757075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kovács Panka","original_name":"Panka Kovács","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/oyZ8LTKgpbETwZGeW3fyU1hhNuz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Léna","credit_id":"61edaa79e9da69001cc5e4ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1259831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivianne Bánovits","original_name":"Vivianne Bánovits","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/2rvm7gH29FAsRzZc8AZBaKrm5fP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Riki","credit_id":"61edaa89eb64f112efdaef13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernő Fekete","original_name":"Ernő Fekete","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/gaOa3DiUYTOZ7bCITppMkLaYvVq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61edaa9302842000945169dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoltán Schmied","original_name":"Zoltán Schmied","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/3Dv7WqUKsWmfTluDFZfhpaIF3rc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61edaa9dc669ad007bcec3d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1945881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliza Sodró","original_name":"Eliza Sodró","popularity":0.3124,"profile_path":"/2EgIPUwgPesvDSXJW2sykKAz3DH.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61edaaa74a4bfc0069ee54d5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2583176,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"György Somogyi","original_name":"György Somogyi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/iPGPyQX7pLJwNyanhFm4ZoqhZIV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Kis kalapos","credit_id":"65ce475ed7dcd2017c1f2d1c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"József Pacskovszky","original_name":"József Pacskovszky","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eda9ba6d4c97006c9f9c77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1478870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ferenc Herczeg","original_name":"Ferenc Herczeg","popularity":0.1494,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eda9d1df2945001b8bc158","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2583176,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"György Somogyi","original_name":"György Somogyi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/iPGPyQX7pLJwNyanhFm4ZoqhZIV.jpg","credit_id":"61eda9e931644b00452c7df0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"József Pacskovszky","original_name":"József Pacskovszky","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eda9ffdf294515b837c09d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17374836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9sHI4q57vrY1Hp6igIbczVN8sJz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zJslboaz18vqOBj8lx0S0lZ7sRz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/2hQXEBkPALPelbLs9XSiQ8Rtbdz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
