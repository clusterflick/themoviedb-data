While a girl misses the last train and spends the night in a phone booth, the words she speaks into the empty receiver impress us with her pregnant tenderness rather than the sadness of her separation from him. Gradually, as we see the gaps in her life, the death of her twin sister when she was a child, her desire to be independent from her mother, and the fact that she really misses him, the movement of images becomes the movement of emotions. The phone booth that is supposed to protect her from the rain looks like a womb, but it is actually cold. When she realizes this, the morning arrives.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/i9pDBcNPRRIEqCFGOH1vPQx6uri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tama Art Academy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"夜明けの晩に","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morimitsu Junko","original_name":"Morimitsu Junko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61f04ba5d38b58004404ed11","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akio Tsutsumi","original_name":"Akio Tsutsumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f04b4ff794ad006bbd5736","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398196,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Takahashi Yoshiaki","original_name":"Takahashi Yoshiaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f04bbdcedac4006cc7a5d4","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398197,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tanaka Tatsuo","original_name":"Tanaka Tatsuo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f04bc9c669ad0058f8f025","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanda Kenichi","original_name":"Kanda Kenichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f04bdae488600042936aa1","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398200,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Enomoto Takeshi","original_name":"Enomoto Takeshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f04be41ad93b004311b519","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9pDBcNPRRIEqCFGOH1vPQx6uri.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
