This film was created in an effort to spread information about the history of the Tongass National Forest, America's largest old growth forest and one of the world's biggest carbon sinks. This film shows why it is important for the United States Department of Agriculture to restore the 2001 Alaska Roadless Rule, an administrative rule that protects almost ten million acres of the Tongass National Forest.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Setting the Table","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396757,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marina Anderson","original_name":"Marina Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ef79dad11e0e00c22323ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xander Samaras","original_name":"Xander Samaras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ef795bd40d4c01167cf243","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
