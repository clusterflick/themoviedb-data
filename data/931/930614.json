Hand screen-printed cover, 350 numbered copies. These are the numbers of URAGANO NEGLI OCCHI, a true story (self)built in the sweaty and smoky corners of the illegal Milan of occupations and hardcore punk concerts. Dozens of voices, interviews, flyers, illustrations and photographs describe a heterogeneous community of individuals, squats and collectives that in recent years has experienced an explosion of vitality, moving with enthusiasm and determination in the contradictions of the metropolitan city of Milan, affirming an unprecedented approach to Do It Yourself practices. An entirely self-produced narrative and visual project, conceived, developed and finalized in our spare time, with a lot of unexpected events in between.","popularity":0.0558,"poster_path":"/97AJkg2uRDQeUnoe7WorQCDkVJR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21508,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Passe Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4056,"logo_path":"/dnz7zZ2e11usyjPG3mTYvJfyciD.png","name":"Hallmark Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20358,"logo_path":"/jPZ0jwLGGELbSxKoUrJzOytNpnp.png","name":"RHI Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Look inside Milan's Hardcore Punk Scene 2015-2020","title":"Uragano negli occhi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3396229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Manzato","original_name":"Francesco Manzato","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/vznzLJoORbApux5PqQMVMkEJDW7.jpg","credit_id":"61eef247e9da6900f42e6edb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Repi Emfshe","original_name":"Filippo Repi Emfshe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eef26dcedac4004354c3cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Pioltelli","original_name":"Paolo Pioltelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eef5b01ad93b5108f84a8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1262,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/19hTBgV1ZUmUzlLFXPwxbII17IM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2243}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/97AJkg2uRDQeUnoe7WorQCDkVJR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
