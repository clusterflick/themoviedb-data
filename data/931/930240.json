My family and I live in Ayase, and I work at a bookstore in Ikebukuro. Sometimes I open a store at a flea market with a friend. We sell tableware, which she likes, and accessories made from buttons, which I make, and they are quite popular. With the money we saved there, my friend went on a long-awaited trip abroad. My goal is to start living alone. Today is my day off, so I go out to check out an apartment. I stopped by a park and saw cats having a meeting. When I saw the old building, I suddenly wanted to see my grandmother, so I took the train...  The entire film is written in monologue and with a handheld 8mm camera, and features all the things \"I\" like: buttons, the dawn from my room, cats, the ocean, and my grandmother. There is no context, no meaning, no great sense of beauty, but they play a comfortable rhythm and a beautiful melody. This is a fictional essay whose natural gentleness reminds us of non-fiction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9lxf8fpgkhfzxgfUAkVkJ8BcZev.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SCENT OF THE SUN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuzawa Yasuyo","original_name":"Yuzawa Yasuyo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61ed9f3adf294500e3152fc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akagi Mimiko","original_name":"Akagi Mimiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61ed9f43ce5d82006a63b727","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikichi Uzunaya","original_name":"Nikichi Uzunaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed8afaeb64f10091210ba9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395036,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hiroshi Fujiki","original_name":"Hiroshi Fujiki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed9eef3faba016505a746d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikichi Uzunaya","original_name":"Nikichi Uzunaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed9f60ea37e0496d16a1b8","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395040,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kozue Sasaguchi","original_name":"Kozue Sasaguchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed9f30ea37e0011439ea77","department":"Art","job":"Runner Art Department"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395038,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Noboru Chiba","original_name":"Noboru Chiba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed9f251ad93b009ab6703c","department":"Art","job":"Runner Art Department"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9lxf8fpgkhfzxgfUAkVkJ8BcZev.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
