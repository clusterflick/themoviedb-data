The re-shot screen changes with the sound of quick beats. An unremarkable local landscape. Roads stretching through rice paddies, clusters of telephone poles, wooden houses with large eaves. These landscapes are transformed into a blur of memory for the purpose of reshooting. The electrically produced noise-like acoustics and the sound of beating quislings beat the landscape out of the memory circuits of the brain. For a moment, a girl stands in front of a screen of landscape, and the landscape rotates around her. The whole work is more than an idea, including the composition in which the synthesis of a kind of screen process brings about change.","popularity":0.0938,"poster_path":"/nTBBJ84XZPPT1irHqJBumMdDCj9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kyūkei","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chino Tetsuya","original_name":"Chino Tetsuya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61ef0f50d11e0e00f22fbec9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saito Fumika","original_name":"Saito Fumika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61ef0f58c669ad011f6f6eea","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Iida","original_name":"飯田譲治","popularity":0.2654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ef0f3242bf010043b5016e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Iida","original_name":"飯田譲治","popularity":0.2654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ef0f3c1ad93b0120f2d039","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Iida","original_name":"飯田譲治","popularity":0.2654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ef0f41d11e0e00f22fbeac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shigawa Amoumata","original_name":"Shigawa Amoumata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ef0f6ed11e0e0046694f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iida Yutaka","original_name":"Iida Yutaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ef0f7a02842000445b909e","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nTBBJ84XZPPT1irHqJBumMdDCj9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
