The images and sounds of mainstream television are jammed, freeze-framed, looped, overlaid and rewound—clips of science documentaries, movies broadcast on TV, nightly news commentary on the minimum wage, and a 60 Minutes style interview with the actor Peter Sellers are all jumbled together. Jenkins interjects several original threads, which show pickup football games gone wrong, a young white couple doing chores and hanging out at home, and Jenkins himself laying on a green suburban yard as a lawnmower moves perilously close to his body.","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":"/8fOTV5irXmGNOFouw3GifMQJLF0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inconsequential Doggereal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2560747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulysses Jenkins","original_name":"Ulysses Jenkins","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/519houzfHwwjKKHz7X7M2x4DADY.jpg","credit_id":"61ef649fdf2945004348ab40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8fOTV5irXmGNOFouw3GifMQJLF0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
