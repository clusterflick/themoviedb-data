They are sore and tired when they reach \"Snakeville.\" They decide to stop overnight, and if fortune favors them to give a performance and gets enough money to ride back to Broadway. Thereat they bill the town and make ready for the performance at the Town Hall that evening. Their efforts to please the critical Snakeville audience are futile and before they have rendered their first selection the audience bowls them off the stage and all leave. Furthermore the management in the box office has decamped to the \"Red Eye\" saloon with all the proceeds of the performance and they are in as bad a fix as before.","popularity":0.1543,"poster_path":"/du0punrlGRqlzaH51aE4FfVg5GE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Town Hall, Tonight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Potel","original_name":"Victor Potel","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/obZCOU7xnxvlkLLfHtlZPs3EB3Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Tall Schultz Brother","credit_id":"61ed9b58c669ad0058f50bb7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augustus Carney","original_name":"Augustus Carney","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/9BIspBub8ZBUnhAo46xlndqcNC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Short Schultz Brother","credit_id":"61ed9b66c669ad007bcea653","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
