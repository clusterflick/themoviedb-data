The tasteful direction shows us the interaction between the rational discipline of the young man who happens to meet Eriko and her intuitive senses. The composition of the film is brilliant, as if a casual description can be traced back and brought to life when it is related to a later scene.","popularity":0.091,"poster_path":"/fud0xBIQS3afva9ATiyXsgLhQ1G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"絵里子","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suenaga Masami","original_name":"Suenaga Masami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61ed7b18ea37e00114399f82","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394654,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Masahiro Korimasa","original_name":"Masahiro Korimasa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed7af831644b010c16917e","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394655,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Kenji Nishiyama","original_name":"Kenji Nishiyama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed7b036d4c97006c9f3c6e","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394651,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shoji Mukai","original_name":"Shoji Mukai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed7abf3faba000960c7918","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirotaka Yamaguchi","original_name":"Hirotaka Yamaguchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed7aae006b01004675363a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kôji Maeda","original_name":"前田弘二","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed7b0ee4886000d53f8379","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394652,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masayuki Inoue","original_name":"Masayuki Inoue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed7aca31644b69041fb462","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3394653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akihiro Morita","original_name":"Akihiro Morita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ed7aec1ad93b001b2b79c3","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fud0xBIQS3afva9ATiyXsgLhQ1G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
