From then to 1997, they became one of the leading groups of the Italian and European independent music scene, carrying on a rigorous musical and existential path, based on the concepts of self-production and self-management, recording a dozen of fundamental records in the history of international hardcore punk. These are years of endless travel across Europe on a shabby van, sharing the alternative life experiences and the battles that animate the anarchist and antagonist movement: the struggle for home and for social spaces; the anti-militarism cause; the refusal of nuclear power; the anti-fascist resistance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1iYT3abo4ntslWJgwTLKjTHdLfY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Korova Audiovisivi","origin_country":""},{"id":168627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Commission Vda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I've Won I've Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianpiero Capra","original_name":"Gianpiero Capra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61f02420d38b58004404b1d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Milani","original_name":"Sergio Milani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61f02440cd204653096bcbd6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Ventrella","original_name":"Alberto Ventrella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61f0246402842000c17fcaaf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gian Luca Rossi","original_name":"Gian Luca Rossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f01fd5c5ada500fac43b98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gian Luca Rossi","original_name":"Gian Luca Rossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f024f5c669ad0058f8b274","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gian Luca Rossi","original_name":"Gian Luca Rossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f0250c6af9dd00ba6add03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margherita Sergi","original_name":"Margherita Sergi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f025433009aa00696c3f45","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Vivaldo","original_name":"Gianni Vivaldo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f02573e48860006dbef5cd","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397824,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raffaele “Neda” D'Anello","original_name":"Raffaele “Neda” D'Anello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f025a0df294515b83b4a7e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1iYT3abo4ntslWJgwTLKjTHdLfY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
