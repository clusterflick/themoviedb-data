Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), a Lancaster through his mother's line, finally wins. This begins the Tudor dynasty and lays the foundation for modern England.  Henry VII, who lived between the times of Richard III and Henry VIII, has been regarded as a mysterious person. As a member of the Lancaster family (the red roses), he was drawn into conflict with Edward IV and Richard III of the York family (the white roses). This work depicts a man thinking of his mother and the expectations of his friends throughout his life, as he aimed for peace in England and the throne.","popularity":0.2188,"poster_path":"/5orGVWEYNBafPsukkGxHLQRXFZQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prince of Roses -The Man Led by the Crown-","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seino Asuka","original_name":"Seino Asuka","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/wPpNL0h2vjuhMw7wtDNbeEKhzAM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Henry Tudor","credit_id":"61ee875ee48860006dbca6a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuunami Kei","original_name":"Yuunami Kei","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hVxcVUsnKthEWnvgqRz2cey0ts1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Duke of Gloucester","credit_id":"61ee877202842000f090d797","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoshizora Misaki","original_name":"Hoshizora Misaki","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/2Ulri6pjtqXgURz2pJ3HL6Eimi2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Isabel","credit_id":"61ee881fdf294500687641ed","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398291,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuuichirou Takeda","original_name":"Yuuichirou Takeda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f05cb7aa659e00d9c6e13e","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398291,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuuichirou Takeda","original_name":"Yuuichirou Takeda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f05cbd6e938a00f49f2ca6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":2079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cPIBs96gYeBo5WbeSJOGGL9ZiSt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3695}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5orGVWEYNBafPsukkGxHLQRXFZQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"},{"id":290635,"name":"flower troupe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TAKARAZUKA REVUE official promotional video \"PRINCE OF ROSES\"","key":"x052ZiXMNi8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-27T05:22:27.000Z","id":"61f2749f559d220043c01888"}]}}}
