Like much of Jenkins's other work, it involved multiple performers, including Maren Hassinger and Senga Nengudi. Here Jenkins addresses social and geopolitical issues—specifically the \"insensitivity of middle-class attitudes towards the Third World\"—often using an invented language referred to as \"doggereal.\" Jenkins confronts Americans' indifference to events outside their own country, particularly to crises and need in poorer nations.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/sIDShKpPW2z62op6OXQOBFmAkbD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without Your Interpretation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2560747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulysses Jenkins","original_name":"Ulysses Jenkins","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/519houzfHwwjKKHz7X7M2x4DADY.jpg","credit_id":"61ef69b11ad93b0070271614","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sIDShKpPW2z62op6OXQOBFmAkbD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
