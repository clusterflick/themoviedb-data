Kaloy faces the adversities of extreme poverty and the judgment of the society towards the marginalization. Kaloy's life is a mirror of those who aspire to go against the strong current of fate in the pursuit of their dreams. However, his life takes the greatest turn as he continues to write his art by showing that the reality of the poor is something that one should never coat with euphemism; as the loudest cry is sometimes the most silent screams one can never let the world hear.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/py6xlzNh54Ou1UB7JKkXT3yyy7U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168601,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tortelyas Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes, silence is the loudest scream.","title":"Tumang Kalinaw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Richard Paredes","original_name":"Ralph Richard Paredes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kaloy","credit_id":"61efb59c028420001b711bcf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Irish Busico","original_name":"Maria Irish Busico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Saryo","credit_id":"61efb5a41ad93b00e91399b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Mendez","original_name":"Erika Mendez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chismosa 1","credit_id":"61efb5b2ea37e001143dc4b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephaney Cortez","original_name":"Stephaney Cortez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chismosa 2","credit_id":"61efb5ba9e4586010732463d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jericho P.
