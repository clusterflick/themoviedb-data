When he returns home from the front wounded, he finds that Mabel has fired Effie, who shows up at Mark's door with her baby, having no place to go. Mark takes her in, but Mabel leaves him when the town shuns him for what they believe is going on with Mark and Effie. Matters are further complicated when Effie, driven to desperation, commits an unspeakable act that results in Mark having a nervous breakdown--and then things get worse.","popularity":0.2789,"poster_path":"/k1YV6UoPn8IWABz1YhRVG6cYfD9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1923-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The motion picture version of A.S.M.
