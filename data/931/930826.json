In their \"Remarks on the Oberhausen 66 Film Festival,\" the GDR documentarians Gerhard Scheumann and Walter Heynowski take the competition selection to task: They see formal experiments as \"excesses on the big screen\" and instead of political themes, they discover a \"surge of perversity.\" After her own film \"Kommando 52\" was rejected by the festival, a criminal complaint by the GDR lawyer Friedrich-Karl Kaul against the mercenary and commander \"Kongo-Müller\" is the focus of a press conference. The refusal of a cinema owner to show the film was a \"hint from the neighbors\", the neighboring public order office, and therefore state censorship in the Federal Republic of Germany.","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":"/88WKTXUEXHjKVLv3wHaI6tkNMXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hint from a Neighbor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerhard Scheumann","original_name":"Gerhard Scheumann","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/urGgeBuunl0IPdvRvo8pkoKXqoW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sprecher","credit_id":"61efc573c669ad004224a4b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hermann Herlinghaus","original_name":"Hermann Herlinghaus","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sprecher","credit_id":"61efc57fe48860006dbe9f5a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1826836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Hornig","original_name":"Harry Hornig","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61efc58b5a788400e198f34c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerhard Scheumann","original_name":"Gerhard Scheumann","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/urGgeBuunl0IPdvRvo8pkoKXqoW.jpg","credit_id":"61efc594c669ad001bbb48df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Heynowski","original_name":"Walter Heynowski","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/s87fL6oRJrX6kf5XIqNG3qM4poN.jpg","credit_id":"61efc59cdf2945001b8ef749","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784758,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Hellmich","original_name":"Peter Hellmich","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61efc5aa6e938a00c4470bb3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397219,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arthur Killus","original_name":"Arthur Killus","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61efc5bd6e938a00973a0531","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171909,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Traute Wischnewski","original_name":"Traute Wischnewski","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61efc5c63009aa011b8d09d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0828137","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/88WKTXUEXHjKVLv3wHaI6tkNMXl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"TV-Premiere (DDR)","release_date":"1966-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
