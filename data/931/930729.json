The piece refers to the cakewalk dance which developed in the mid-eighteenth century among enslaved African Americans as, among other things, a way to covertly ridicule slaveholders. The dancers in Cake Walk move amid Conwill's sculptures and paintings, one of Conwill's cosmograms painted on the floor beneath them.","popularity":0.0733,"poster_path":"/4kWr1EUax2j5ooHxkALQ06D9blJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cake Walk","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2560747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulysses Jenkins","original_name":"Ulysses Jenkins","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/519houzfHwwjKKHz7X7M2x4DADY.jpg","credit_id":"61ef63fda402c100d678a4ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22059252","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4kWr1EUax2j5ooHxkALQ06D9blJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
