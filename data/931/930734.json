Also included are clips of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, explicitly linking the development of jazz to the Civil Rights Movement. Motion-capture animated figures are seen dancing, superimposed, over the archival footage of the musicians. Wearing colorful costumes, they perform Jenkins’ original choreography. The dancers exert a powerful influence over the historical documentation as their movements extend across the decades and, finally, into the future.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/6smae3fwruMtyiXzGkOdFXZcXgi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notions of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Banks-Smith","original_name":"Cheryl Banks-Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"628e34d11495650066322fe0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2560747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulysses Jenkins","original_name":"Ulysses Jenkins","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/519houzfHwwjKKHz7X7M2x4DADY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"628e34ddd48cee2cbe6770ca","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563534,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mugen Suzuki","original_name":"Mugen Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e34f3d48cee2cbfcd3469","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563535,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lisa Naugle","original_name":"Lisa Naugle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e3542323eba00668fda93","department":"Crew","job":"Motion Capture Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ross Whitney","original_name":"Ross Whitney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e3552209f1812c55df03e","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563537,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kei Akagi","original_name":"Kei Akagi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e357a323eba00668fdb0d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2560747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulysses Jenkins","original_name":"Ulysses Jenkins","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/519houzfHwwjKKHz7X7M2x4DADY.jpg","credit_id":"61ef66bad11e0e001d3c1dc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6smae3fwruMtyiXzGkOdFXZcXgi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
