Vincent Boussard's arresting Toulouse production does full justice to this newly renewed masterpiece. Three international principals take on the work's demanding roles: Chinese tenor Yijie Shi is a 'revelation' as Fernand, the rich-toned, authoritative French baritone Ludovic Tezier as King Alphonse XI and lauded American mezzo Kate Aldrich - 'the Carmen of this generation' - plumbing the emotional depths of Leonor's music. Conductor and bel canto specialist Antonello Allemandi adds to the passionate proceedings onstage. Maestro Allemandi demonstrated full authority over the stage for the musically complex scenes, and in the arias and duets demonstrated his confidence in the singers by establishing ample tempos to support their soaring vocal lines.","popularity":0.3588,"poster_path":"/c2TgkKNhCU3KfjfaLaE0UQCaeiO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Worthy Performance of an Operatic Gem","title":"Donizetti La Favorite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1199136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Aldrich","original_name":"Kate Aldrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xuQkgRlqAOjBM9nHEca6xsKjnDp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Leonor De Guzman","credit_id":"660cb22b6dc507016455a3f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2180574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yijie Shi","original_name":"Yijie Shi","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/uNwUByK2eX9ucn9kl4LzyOlzi6N.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fernand","credit_id":"660cb2540b5fd60162372f40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Tézier","original_name":"Ludovic Tézier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/u9OD8isxAGK1oLJBs2HSHFCYo07.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alphonse XI","credit_id":"660cb27ba885870162e63e34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Furlanetto","original_name":"Giovanni Furlanetto","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aa2HFmnkU12zeqS7gGZYDFzIipz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Balthazar","credit_id":"660cb29da885870149e5474b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Bénédicte Souquet","original_name":"Marie-Bénédicte Souquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ines","credit_id":"660cb2d6c8a5ac017c7a526a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Gabriel","original_name":"Alain Gabriel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Don Gaspar","credit_id":"660cb2f69c97bd017ca5f900","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4630999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dongjin Ahn","original_name":"Dongjin Ahn","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"A Lord","credit_id":"660cb347149565017dbbc3c9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonello Allemandi","original_name":"Antonello Allemandi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hTLoOwqnE4RWcbMrzrIBOdKwtL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self -
