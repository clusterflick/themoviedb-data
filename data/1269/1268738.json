The film explores fundamental notions of movement, freedom and the cinematic imaginary through the figure of the camel. Rather than focusing on the Moroccan patrimonial landscape, which is itself full of simulations and fantasies conjured for the touristic imagination, Pandian shot the video in Ouarzazate, Hollywood’s go-to location to stage the desert — from Lawrence of Arabia to The Mummy. Littered with deteriorating sets constructed for films set in Jerusalem, ancient Egypt, Rome, Mecca… etc, the site portrayed in the video is itself disoriented, as Pandian collapses the distinction between set and location. Is it the Middle East? Is it the Western imagination of the Middle East? Is it a Moroccan fiction of the Middle East constructed for a Western gaze?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1Mg68zNLYdFjSj7FJFhyXGLVlXs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atlas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3534030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karthik Pandian","original_name":"Karthik Pandian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d25fbda9ef2017d580045","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1724,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Mg68zNLYdFjSj7FJFhyXGLVlXs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1149}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
