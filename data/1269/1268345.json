Using her rediscovered personal archival footage, the director shares the front-row story of this unique era of alternative rock through the lens of one band's experience, The New Rising Sons. The film brings to life a vibrant New York music scene of the past as it follows the band’s brush with stardom, their dissolution, and their journey to redemption 20 years after they were formed.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bvm9wL6iPiTLETfTQvWmhT3Fkbe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Via 73 Films","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endless Calls For Fame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4630144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Serafini-Sauli","original_name":"Olivia Serafini-Sauli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660c38226dc507017e559b63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2322263,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"María Gabriela Torres","original_name":"María Gabriela Torres","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660c383bc8a5ac017c79c4fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4630144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Serafini-Sauli","original_name":"Olivia Serafini-Sauli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660c384c33a376016480d410","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1609,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bvm9wL6iPiTLETfTQvWmhT3Fkbe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1125},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wXBaP9dsQJzaOqkMUjfazJEmzBi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
