What would you say, if you only ever got to play the bear? Part of an original sonnet trilogy discussing the nature of animal characters within Shakespeare's plays, their flaws, and how a feminine Gaze alters their narrative. Actors playing the parts of A Midsummer Night Dream's 'Lion', Two Gentlemen of Verona's 'Dog' and Winters Tale's 'Bear', take their seats in a confessional where they share their experiences with Willamina; a queer reimagining of Shakespeare who sits the other side of the gauze adorned with nipple tassles and elaborate ruff. Shown in three chapters, each chapter includes talking heads style investigations of the vibrant cartoon like characters, the presentation of their personal sonnet, and flash back sequences In anachronistic low brow locations.","popularity":0.1669,"poster_path":"/q8dkfQi6EDACEhnHwN4eFCVuB8l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saucy Sonnets and Animal Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Valls","original_name":"Andrea Valls","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"660d7468149565017dbc738b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2908062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Lampert","original_name":"Jake Lampert","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/91VwT83z2kCFViHh8qfULsUkzHT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"660d747215dea0017c365bac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3172071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Moran","original_name":"Katherine Moran","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"660d74c433a376017d827aae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Sealey","original_name":"Phil Sealey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"660d74cde039f10149e4a89e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Brown","original_name":"Charlotte Brown","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"660d74e7a88587017ce87c6e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winter Hamilton","original_name":"Winter Hamilton","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"660d74f2d400f3017d066434","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632068,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chloe Doherty","original_name":"Chloe Doherty","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d745715dea0017c365b98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632069,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shaun Fricker","original_name":"Shaun Fricker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d74269c97bd0163a4ca32","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632068,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chloe Doherty","original_name":"Chloe Doherty","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d741c9c97bd017ca6ee91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632071,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Willis","original_name":"Adam Willis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d744f9c97bd017ca6eebf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31939534","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q8dkfQi6EDACEhnHwN4eFCVuB8l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
