Channel Street founders and advocates continue to push for a reopening but the legal matter proves to be a much more complex task than anyone ever imagined. Concrete Law explores the battle between Channel Street Skatepark and bureaucratic control. This film uncovers the history of the park, from creation to current status, through interviews with park founders, local and pro skaters, business owners, and city officials.","popularity":0.522,"poster_path":"/kRTQK4tM2m2zARDjy2B9UZ8JO2F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iron Light Labs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concrete Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Hawk","original_name":"Tony Hawk","popularity":0.5706,"profile_path":"/gYNmD0a7LemMX6zDZ1lyDs6YYwd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"660d70e995ce2401646e8ba0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Sandoval","original_name":"Ronnie Sandoval","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7lIHc5TDAPVTDA6slnKrjatFN8k.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"660d70f1d400f3017d066217","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Watt","original_name":"Mike Watt","popularity":0.2733,"profile_path":"/nUjaItfJaJQmOvRj2YI8j0IuZEm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"660d70ff9c97bd0130a2dba6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873180,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Van Doren","original_name":"Steve Van Doren","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/oK001jIsFRvMocG54S0tt4IgGDY.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"660d7111e039f1017ce7a47d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"April Jones","original_name":"April Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d6f4a9c97bd0149a36c68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632046,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josh Landau","original_name":"Josh Landau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d6f929c97bd017ca6eb43","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632048,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rob Crawford","original_name":"Rob Crawford","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d6fd433a376017d827798","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elias Parise","original_name":"Elias Parise","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d6fdb5aadc4017c666f66","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632048,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rob Crawford","original_name":"Rob Crawford","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d6fed35818f017c3c49e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632052,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Neiratko","original_name":"Chris Neiratko","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d70079c97bd017ca6eb94","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Kaiser","original_name":"Joe Kaiser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d7089d400f3014a058516","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632055,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Engman","original_name":"Chris Engman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d70965aadc4017c667001","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632055,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Engman","original_name":"Chris Engman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d70a75aadc4017c667016","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pGpHPWswhXODKYB3XLzFUqjtt7U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kRTQK4tM2m2zARDjy2B9UZ8JO2F.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":943},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":761,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1fttNUq8MBGykaf1zNj2dXtlIyS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Night Visions Film Festival","release_date":"2024-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
