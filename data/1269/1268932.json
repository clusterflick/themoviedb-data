The women living in that kind of village misbelieve that if a woman has a curse of milk ogre upon her, her baby will die by taking her breast milk. So, to avoid this tragedy, she denies to breastfeed her baby and rather sells the baby to someone else for adoption and then break the curse. The film was directed for the purpose of expressing this strange obsession.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":225189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aung Thiri Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"2019-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Milk Ogre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lu Min","original_name":"Lu Min","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Milk Ogre","credit_id":"660d8ae89c97bd0163a4d31c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2203786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zay Ye Htet","original_name":"Zay Ye Htet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Phoe La Min","credit_id":"660d8b130b5fd6017c397e20","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4129093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shwe Hmone Yati","original_name":"Shwe Hmone Yati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Byine Phyu","credit_id":"660d8b2f9c97bd017ca70111","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myat Mon","original_name":"Myat Mon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Daw Swal Mi","credit_id":"660d8b5d15dea00162346547","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lu Min","original_name":"Lu Min","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d8a7715dea001623464b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shwe Aye Ko","original_name":"Shwe Aye Ko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d8ab46dc507017e569e0d","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093952,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nyein Min","original_name":"Nyein Min","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d8a94d400f3016405d874","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"my","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
