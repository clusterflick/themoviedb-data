In this triple constellation we explore the power of the gaze and the roles it imposes on us. An artist's studio turns into the setting for questions about how we look at and perceive women.

And how this body shapes our experience of the world and our role in it.","popularity":0.3519,"poster_path":"/nV7fD2BIYPPqm8zs99OkYMiYThf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Université de Liège","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Naked Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"The Naked Truth","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4631864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Grobusch","original_name":"Lena Grobusch","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Aktmodell","credit_id":"660d53e6c8a5ac0163792afd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4631865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Hamp","original_name":"Katharina Hamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Künstlerin","credit_id":"660d53f395ce24017d6f1448","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4631864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Grobusch","original_name":"Lena Grobusch","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d541dd400f3017d065375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4631864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Grobusch","original_name":"Lena Grobusch","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d543f33a376013180d94f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4631864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Grobusch","original_name":"Lena Grobusch","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d5459e039f10162e5d3fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4631868,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Katharina Hamp","original_name":"Katharina Hamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d54840b5fd6017c3957bf","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4631869,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eric Loeffler","original_name":"Eric Loeffler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d5494a88587017ce866c9","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32046334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ngaeOB4LgodEyDAOWrsmoSIl06p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3839}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nV7fD2BIYPPqm8zs99OkYMiYThf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11718,"name":"feminist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":244775,"name":"male gaze"},{"id":246601,"name":"nude"},{"id":282931,"name":"female gaze"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":["Nudity"],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Offener Kanal Rhein-Main","release_date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
