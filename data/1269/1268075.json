But What Happened to Eve?","overview":"A vision of Eve in a greenhouse paradise. Discontented, she takes a bus to the city while Adam is in the fields. There, she assumes the position of barmaid and occasional stripper in a sleazy nightclub that is the prime target of an apocalyptic fire. This is a reaction against the concept of the fall of humankind as presented in the holy Bible, which in most Christian circles places the blame completely on Eve herself. The absurdity of this idea and the film itself should be recognized.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/olJhjCpetUFc8cJ62FxC6yTrx8q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adam Went On To Till the Soil...
