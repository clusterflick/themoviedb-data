Stories which will raise the hairs on the neck of Lincolnshire people, include accounts of supernatural experiences and apparitions from most of the major towns of the county; including Lincoln, Boston, and Skegness. Lincolnshireâ€™s notoriously flat countryside has made it a natural home for many airfields, and we also recount many stories associated with ghosts that still haunt the sites of previous disasters involving pilots and ground crew. After watching this film the viewer will understand why Lincolnshire has been dubbed the most frightening county in England.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sFgLBnKrIduHLTAFbsWgkIQL4XN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lincolnshire Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Felix","original_name":"Richard Felix","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"660c0bf3e039f10149e46245","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":895,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFgLBnKrIduHLTAFbsWgkIQL4XN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":613}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
