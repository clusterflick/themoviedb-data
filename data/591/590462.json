That is the victory battle cry when kites are eliminated in raging sky duels, sometimes lasting hours. Filmed entirely in Lahore, Pakistan, over three continuous days, Bo Kata is a rare cinematic documentary treat, depicting uniquely the rooftop kite flyers of Lahore, who have been a traditional part of Pakistan's culture and heritage that has lasted for over 400 years. Their sport is now under threat from a complete ban, after a series of tragic fatalities involving children and motorcyclists, resulting in decapitations and dismemberment from illegal chemically coated strings used to fly the kites. The documentary highlights a population that is associated with the mysterious art of kite dueling amidst the political backdrop of an impending ban","popularity":0.4384,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmedup","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bo Kata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shehzad Afzal","original_name":"Shehzad Afzal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9809db0e0a264ccec1af79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273227,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Walden","original_name":"John Walden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c980bb99251416b41f62c16","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shehzad Afzal","original_name":"Shehzad Afzal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c980bce0e0a26400ebeb692","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shehzad Afzal","original_name":"Shehzad Afzal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c980bf0925141186bf568d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shehzad Afzal","original_name":"Shehzad Afzal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c980b9d9251411742f555c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1382716","wikidata_id":"Q4931112","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7021,"name":"pakistan"},{"id":175910,"name":"kite flying"},{"id":210547,"name":"kite"},{"id":237117,"name":"pakistani culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ur","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
