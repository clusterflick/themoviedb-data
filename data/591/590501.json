Another trading post owner, Langrand, and police sergeant Spenlow, the only two civilized people in the area, fall in love with Katrina. They follow the husband and wife as they head further north for a chance that, until now, the husband has been reluctant to take. One day, Mercier catches his partner, an adventurer, trying to take advantage of Katrina; he kills him but is wounded. The couple and the two other whites attempt to return south, but Mercier dies of his wound along the way. Caught in a storm, the three survivors get lost; the dogs abandon them. Spenlow, realizing that Katrina loves Langrand, sacrifices himself to leave them his supplies; he is devoured by wolves. Langrand and Katrina are saved in extremis by a hunter.","popularity":0.319,"poster_path":"/dUvUBQjnTJ4v0o6helLlZDwkHi7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1951-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Lächeln im Sturm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sturm über Alaska","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curd Jürgens","original_name":"Curd Jürgens","popularity":0.684,"profile_path":"/ewM6Zh2XGxFuxQ2Ec8zBKJWn4Cq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean Langrand","credit_id":"5c9827130e0a2671e1be95b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Werner","original_name":"Oskar Werner","popularity":0.3285,"profile_path":"/lioi0MRwO5ltEGIxzG19BLrcuPl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Francois Mercier","credit_id":"5c98272292514139baf321f4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1340893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aglaja Schmid","original_name":"Aglaja Schmid","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/zYpes1I1VOub68VgZJBOCmOCFkg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Katrina Mercier","credit_id":"5c9827450e0a2610e5be8fde","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Bussières","original_name":"Raymond Bussières","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/5d6wxs8ZlwDp276pfnPnfWArdyf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Paname","credit_id":"5c9827559251416b0cf32bf2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ney","original_name":"Richard Ney","popularity":0.1912,"profile_path":"/ab8m2YaB30PrQkrXa2OfuyFToDl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6211c94b89b561001b7e6fa3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Berri","original_name":"Robert Berri","popularity":0.1684,"profile_path":"/pDw3Al7ysvnaMAswDSopgy2BGq6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6211c94f41465c006c60d4f9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291711,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Franz Tassié","original_name":"Franz Tassié","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6262c5556eecee30f2c694f1","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2719989,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Constantin-Weyer","original_name":"Maurice Constantin-Weyer","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6262c548d1a8933366cd42d8","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Chanas","original_name":"René Chanas","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9826fec3a3684bd238ea06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1530885","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dUvUBQjnTJ4v0o6helLlZDwkHi7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
