Cross-cutting between the girl protagonist and her father, the film creates a sense of crisis and conflict. As the girl invests her feelings in her surroundings and describes events connected to her father, we are drawn into a world of pain and pathos.  Morley's first directorial credit was her graduation film from Central St. Martin's School of Art.","popularity":0.3291,"poster_path":"/kw5SLR3cujqctMs9sflD66stnqX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imogen Nooney","original_name":"Imogen Nooney","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"5c9789a90e0a262352bfe5e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Evans","original_name":"Elizabeth Evans","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Girl's voice","credit_id":"61a91b921f3319002b1133a8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":163998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carol Morley","original_name":"Carol Morley","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/iuKuNRNUTXsnOpCslygaf5tjlrW.jpg","credit_id":"5c9789899251416b3af54b39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":163998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carol Morley","original_name":"Carol Morley","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/iuKuNRNUTXsnOpCslygaf5tjlrW.jpg","credit_id":"5c9789930e0a264cc9c0b777","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16269082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kw5SLR3cujqctMs9sflD66stnqX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c2jYvZpPjq6ccwW0w3FMV0A871c.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
