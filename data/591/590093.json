A friend of the family in which the wife died in labour loved her more than life itself, although he will never say it out loud. He gladly agrees to babysit the child for a day and brings her home, where he is suddenly faced with resentment from his relatives. This multifigured film with beautiful unspoken truths talks about widowhood of other people and oneself, about others’ children who can be dearer than the yet unborn children of one’s own, and about love that does not follow the loved one into the grave.","popularity":0.2003,"poster_path":"/4F8aknFZpbR6ywNxtN5pJIc9dqR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In His Place","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doraid Liddawi","original_name":"Doraid Liddawi","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/lPgFtk3gwIXk2XTQdQ5WkcbU7Ey.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Omar","credit_id":"5c95e68bc3a3682e66f519ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gali Blecher","original_name":"Gali Blecher","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gali","credit_id":"5c95e6650e0a2645ee51feb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1112592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitali Friedland","original_name":"Vitali Friedland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eyal","credit_id":"5c95e670c3a3682e4df513f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Zreik","original_name":"Maria Zreik","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/wB2YGtBjfCl2syONpVQQjWEbaqh.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mira","credit_id":"5c95e6b20e0a2623f34f1864","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salwa Nakkara","original_name":"Salwa Nakkara","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/kzYkdo8P6WeBPsME8owxSLxMvuf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nur","credit_id":"5c95e6a5925141730377ac33","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anat Hadid","original_name":"Anat Hadid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/619nlqqSZXxIS4OuWSLEuteRBV1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lin","credit_id":"5c95e67e0e0a2645f7520991","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahmoud More","original_name":"Mahmoud More","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Fadi","credit_id":"5c95e699c3a3682e53f4f728","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Bakri","original_name":"Mohammad Bakri","popularity":0.251,"profile_path":"/bNF2O4TXDoF8sivoqvipeiCqVqu.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mohammad","credit_id":"638e6e8e04733f00e363d2ee","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ofir Feldman","original_name":"Ofir Feldman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c95e623c3a3682e4df5138e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ofir Feldman","original_name":"Ofir Feldman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09db300e0a266f99cc4796","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7875484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4F8aknFZpbR6ywNxtN5pJIc9dqR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tel Aviv International Student Film Festival","release_date":"2018-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2019-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
