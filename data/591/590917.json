A place where they can forget their everyday life and gain courage to change a skate culture that has been dominated exclusively by boys for the past decades. DON’T GIVE A FOX follows three different girls in their early 20s, who each are seeking to gain a foothold. It’s a coming-of-age story about identity, love and skating.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/yGKdjvko73UB584wes8ix9xbqie.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88293,"logo_path":"/q4uunfEJRQhTfzFdAFfC6zMvqPo.png","name":"Good Company Pictures","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Should we be as boring as our parents?","title":"Don't Give a Fox","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofie Ekerdine","original_name":"Sofie Ekerdine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c9a39f59251416e8ff6583d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Line Mortensen Thoresen","original_name":"Line Mortensen Thoresen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c9a3a089251417760f64a7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Signe Werenberg","original_name":"Signe Werenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c9a3a19925141780cf64a20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Oline","original_name":"Amanda Oline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c9a3a260e0a266aa0bfaef8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2274468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricia Drati","original_name":"Patricia Drati","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fE3aHqElFdKCnFKvgK0BJrKCwRn.jpg","credit_id":"5c9a39790e0a2671e1c2081f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287743,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Bauer","original_name":"Michael Bauer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/r9Hcv234T34FbxGl8alEGMSkOgu.jpg","credit_id":"5c9a399f0e0a264cd3c58022","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspar Astrup Schröder","original_name":"Kaspar Astrup Schröder","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9a395b0e0a264ccec55a17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspar Astrup Schröder","original_name":"Kaspar Astrup Schröder","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9a39c60e0a261ba2c1f60b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9295640","wikidata_id":"Q64052330","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1356,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zXzkDBoT4XruK9EpLq9n8s91Z6F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2412}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGKdjvko73UB584wes8ix9xbqie.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
