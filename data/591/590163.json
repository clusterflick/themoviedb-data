Tamiko married her deceased friend Mari's (Mami Nakamura) husband. Tamiko gets along well with her step-daughter Kotoyo, but Kotoyo still doesn't call her mother. There is a traditional sumo game held to celebrate the moving of Mizuwakasu's shrine. The traditional sumo game is important to Tamiko who grew up on the island, while her husband Hideaki's reputation is not so good on the island because he broke off his engagement to a woman his parents set him up with. In order to marry his first wife Mari, he ran away from the island. Since then, his parents disowned him. Nevertheless, Hideaki and his first wife Mari still liked the island and went back to live there. Hideaki began sum wrestling then.","popularity":0.5789,"poster_path":"/dCOWF90H4Ft3aA9W3mpgoxX7HPt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With All Our Might","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"With all our might","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"渾身 KON-SHIN","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayumi Ito","original_name":"伊藤歩","popularity":0.9028,"profile_path":"/9uc0XnA8nAcCYInxUq5nkNSHc7N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tamiko Sakamoto","credit_id":"5c96660ac3a36841a739041d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sho Aoyagi","original_name":"青柳翔","popularity":0.7714,"profile_path":"/pN2JQVg5OyNSdxSLAHE8ncSAnpT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hideaki Sakamoto","credit_id":"5c9666229251416b41f34190","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahiro Koumoto","original_name":"甲本雅裕","popularity":0.7489,"profile_path":"/4JkKaQG7rbA4AYQ3sOMzEOxwnHv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kiyokazu Yamamoto","credit_id":"5c96663bc3a36841b9390578","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1248943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Zaizen","original_name":"財前直見","popularity":0.336,"profile_path":"/s9kNjY8cLs3ivxb2KtqvZRiJOP2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nobue Obayashi","credit_id":"5c9666569251416b36f33fa6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Sasano","original_name":"笹野高史","popularity":0.6192,"profile_path":"/172tux6gIAzCP1quDE0KqrUzNQL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tsuyoshi Nagami","credit_id":"5c9666a1c3a36841b339089f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hatsunori Hasegawa","original_name":"長谷川初範","popularity":0.4999,"profile_path":"/1A67SVH35pyebs16Cun7bxO9YEA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Chuji Yoshida","credit_id":"5c9666cc0e0a264cbdbeac27","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katsuo Nakamura","original_name":"中村嘉葎雄","popularity":0.9405,"profile_path":"/wWRFSaZQTl1XeEdkbwW4HP23VS6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kazuchiyo Hosoda","credit_id":"5c9666ee0e0a264cc6bead18","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":986818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshinari Nishikôri","original_name":"錦織良成","popularity":0.2429,"profile_path":"/7IEPgRfNveCnVXV3phcWZpMntsI.jpg","credit_id":"5c9667d50e0a264cd3bea855","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":986818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshinari Nishikôri","original_name":"錦織良成","popularity":0.2429,"profile_path":"/7IEPgRfNveCnVXV3phcWZpMntsI.jpg","credit_id":"5c9668069251416b41f3445d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607248,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Sosuke Yoshikado","original_name":"吉角荘介","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678cf8b61afc346467651b99","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2317450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ijsRKMsIngDFtsQEs7uwP4Qiupx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":767,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dCOWF90H4Ft3aA9W3mpgoxX7HPt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"『渾身 KON-SHIN』予告編","key":"p7nwZRrJxIY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2012-09-14T10:42:23.000Z","id":"5c9662999251416b2af3356f"}]}}}
