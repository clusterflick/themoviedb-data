In the perspective of \"do it but do not say\", the micro-stories of all the characters are alternated with the omnipresent co-protagonist of the story: the heat. The young bride, the greedy priest, the hedonist nun, the old women of the village, the femme fatale, the witnesses of the spouses, the relatives, the various guests and the groom himself tell with twists and sympathetic snapshots of almost Pirandellian humor timeless history where the clichés of a corrupt and indifferent society parade on the notes of the wedding march.","popularity":0.1023,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sensi Contemporanei Cinema e Audiovisivo","origin_country":""},{"id":116324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regione Basilicata","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il più bel giorno della mia vita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimmo Conte","original_name":"Mimmo Conte","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c98d71fc3a36873193a1fb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Schettino","original_name":"Laura Schettino","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nvPXa9T1tm3LjBYfA5fWjgk751j.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c98d7330e0a264cc3c31784","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Nestola","original_name":"Walter Nestola","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/gOGQkvDMusjiJHPONcFCnh3sDVL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c98d7420e0a264cc3c3179e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annamaria La Stella","original_name":"Annamaria La Stella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c98d7529251416e8ff44475","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Pappacena","original_name":"Fabio Pappacena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c98d7630e0a2610e5bfbaae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara Sabia","original_name":"Mara Sabia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c98d76f0e0a264cc6c33f8a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Musmanno","original_name":"Enzo Musmanno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c98d77d0e0a261ba2bfb528","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1764416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Franchi","original_name":"Massimo Franchi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4Ve5ltWDeJULJg3EEO4qpqGFB6l.jpg","credit_id":"5c98d7b5925141780cf43d83","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273669,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valerio de Bonis","original_name":"Valerio de Bonis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c98d7c5c3a36872983a1f8e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino Santoro","original_name":"Dino Santoro","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/m1k6jbcpuZL1ASN8dnG5A7YObIa.jpg","credit_id":"5c98d79fc3a36863b73a2520","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino Santoro","original_name":"Dino Santoro","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/m1k6jbcpuZL1ASN8dnG5A7YObIa.jpg","credit_id":"5c98d7940e0a264cd3c33ec1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273670,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Davide Ronzi","original_name":"Davide Ronzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c98d7d49251417760f42e4b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10075664","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
