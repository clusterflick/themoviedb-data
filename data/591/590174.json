At the Royal Library in the heart of Copenhagen, researchers and intermediaries work side by side with the library's visitors who come to read and study, but also to participate in talks, concerts, lectures and exhibitions that fill the halls all year round. This documentary looks behind the scenes in a year where Marina Abramovic and Olafur Eliasson contribute to the program, and where colonial history and climate change take center stage.","popularity":0.349,"poster_path":"/lInUW6bdK82lVtKuAq29O1WTdaq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Word for Human","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"A Word for Human: Royal Danish Library","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mauricio Gonz치lez-Aranda","original_name":"Mauricio Gonz치lez-Aranda","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9673560e0a264cc6bebf6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mauricio Gonz치lez-Aranda","original_name":"Mauricio Gonz치lez-Aranda","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9672bbc3a36841973915c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10133220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lInUW6bdK82lVtKuAq29O1WTdaq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":295,"name":"library"},{"id":509,"name":"denmark"},{"id":792,"name":"copenhagen, denmark"},{"id":238072,"name":"books"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"CPH:DOX International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
