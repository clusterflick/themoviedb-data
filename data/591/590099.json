The story concerns a worker's wife, who is bored with her dreary existence in the wilderness.  She walks around in the snow recalling how she met her husband, then goes to the landing field to catch a departing plane.  But she remains when her husband tells her how much his work means to him.  This moving and very humanistic tale represents the NFB at its best.","popularity":0.2435,"poster_path":"/3IQ5WgG1rzu3PWtrvGFHtRicTSr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF |
