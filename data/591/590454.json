The characters of this cartographic film tell the tale of a rural world whose ancestral culture is vanishing in time. Through a multi-dimensional gaze we move among an emotional landscape that ranges from melancholy to humour. With an observational tone and an almost surreal manner, INLAND proposes a sensorial trip through the empty territory of Spain.","popularity":0.1616,"poster_path":"/8zuPCxHZI43fpeGJ9J2nVX5BJsJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77235,"logo_path":"/kTNwMcJB4n3ipo4JpJCVApJpJ1g.png","name":"Doxa Producciones","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":142707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jabuba Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Palacios","original_name":"Juan Palacios","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9806acc3a36841ae3bfb05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Palacios","original_name":"Juan Palacios","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99c61f1fb94f00363a7c87","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Palacios","original_name":"Juan Palacios","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99c62c37b3a900380b3cd0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584715,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zuri Goikoetxea","original_name":"Zuri Goikoetxea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99c5e16eecee00368d7139","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808035,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cristina Hergueta","original_name":"Cristina Hergueta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99c5a3b4a543003935178b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624805,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ainhoa Andraka","original_name":"Ainhoa Andraka","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99c5eb079a970039426a3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11686834","wikidata_id":"Q100742605","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lfd2xEK12qgwCSh2PtqtDx8Hjhw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1497,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zuPCxHZI43fpeGJ9J2nVX5BJsJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1055}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World premiere at CPH:DOX","release_date":"2019-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
