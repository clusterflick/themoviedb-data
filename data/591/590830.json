They built Las Vegas. They terrorized America with their vicious murders and fearless robberies. They are men named Bugsy Siegel, Al Capone, John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Lucky Luciano. And, for the first time, THE AMERICAN GANGSTER tells the true story behind their ruthless rise to wealth and power. Filled with vintage film and actual photographs, THE AMERICAN GANGSTER is a gripping look at the birth of organized crime. From prohibition to prostitution, from gangland massacres to gambling empires, their most infamous deeds are chronicled in shocking detail. Even more explosive than the movies they inspired, such as Scarface and The Godfather, are the true histories of the brilliant, brutal gangsters who turned the American Dream into an ongoing nightmare.","popularity":0.303,"poster_path":"/s4YvR3LPn4FMnSBN2PDb52G7s3y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Crime pays.","title":"The American Gangster","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Farina","original_name":"Dennis Farina","popularity":0.5349,"profile_path":"/4hEWe0ZcDpGlB3nRizLkVMcG13B.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5c99a4869251416b0cf5c516","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":670,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Burtt","original_name":"Ben Burtt","popularity":0.8164,"profile_path":"/7asFDWjls2bYQSfXJf5StjXmlhI.jpg","credit_id":"5c99a4a3c3a36872983ba260","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0297726","wikidata_id":"Q7713346","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s4YvR3LPn4FMnSBN2PDb52G7s3y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
