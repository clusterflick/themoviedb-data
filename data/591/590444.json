Mary was six years old when she vanished on her grandparents’ remote farm in Donegal in March 1977 while in the company of her uncle Gerry Gallagher.  The documentary contains disturbing allegations by a number of retired senior police officers that a local politician interfered in the case, ordering that the chief suspect not be arrested. He never has been and still lives in Donegal today.  The documentary, written and directed by Gemma O’Doherty, has won several international awards and has been viewed almost 1 million times on YouTube. It led to public outcry in Ireland with marches and vigils held around the country demanding justice for Mary. A new police review of the case was ordered within days of the film’s release but the suspect remains at large and Mary’s body has yet to be returned to her identical twin sister Ann for burial.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/ttcqcH8MUMmisCt320k7lBlx2vV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mary Boyle: The Untold Story","title":"Mary Boyle: The Untold Story","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gemma O’Doherty","original_name":"Gemma O’Doherty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"5c97fcde925141193ef539a3","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ngYCVnkWzIDSTUCqPepJraxZwzZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ttcqcH8MUMmisCt320k7lBlx2vV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1015}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
