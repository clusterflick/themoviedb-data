Over a seven year training period, these \"running Buddha\" figuratively circle the globe on foot. During one incredible 100-day stretch, they cover 52.5 miles daily - twice the length of an Olympic marathon. The prize they seek is not a pot of gold, but enlightenment in the here and now.  This documentary program is about one of these amazing men - Tanno Kakudo and the magic mountain where he trains. It is the philosophy of Tendai Buddhism, which inspires him in his quest for the supreme. The viewer will learn about the monk's death-defying fast, his vegetarian training diet, his handmade straw running shoes, and other feats of endurance such as the mummifying fire ceremony. Based on the book \"Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei\" by John Stevens, published by Shambala Press.","popularity":0.0607,"poster_path":"/tympLOkvh4KhWXvDst8GqvT0fFI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2637115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher J.
