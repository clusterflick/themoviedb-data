But people like to forget that the periphery went through the same social upheavals – Central Switzerland, for example. This is hardly surprising: in the founding cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy, society followed a strict order; tradition, shaped by centuries of Catholic rule, seemed untouchable.

Switzerland.","popularity":0.4063,"poster_path":"/aXo0eEchg3k5WDanKXSKSh1U0ml.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mythenfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1968
