Vincent Dieutre puts faces and voices on some of the many artists who have settled there since the collapse of the Wall. Questioning each one about their arrival and possible departure, he depicts how Berlin has become part of the personal stories that have, in turn, been infused with a city’s history. What each artist recounts with their own words and sensitivity is also what the city has taught them – the vocabulary of the sentiments in German, the strength to live in the cold or in precarious conditions. Like a playful wink to the tourist guide format, the filmmaker travels from district to district.","popularity":0.0513,"poster_path":"/mrvz5Xspvzjy9PEyyMzFklcbGqI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43981,"logo_path":"/cxDm1Jf73QyMYPrgHenEIR1tH1R.png","name":"La Huit","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Based","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1035306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Dieutre","original_name":"Vincent Dieutre","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/uGzgVRazZYnIRhJHVdfkg75dMXK.jpg","credit_id":"5c9533a1925141731e76665b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1035306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Dieutre","original_name":"Vincent Dieutre","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/uGzgVRazZYnIRhJHVdfkg75dMXK.jpg","credit_id":"5c9533ad9251417318764f6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Pasquier","original_name":"Arnold Pasquier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9b57c89251416b0cf7ffb4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097254,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathias Bouffier","original_name":"Mathias Bouffier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9b57d70e0a264cc6c70845","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097255,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stéphane Jourdain","original_name":"Stéphane Jourdain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9b5809c3a3680bbd3979d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10584880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mrvz5Xspvzjy9PEyyMzFklcbGqI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
