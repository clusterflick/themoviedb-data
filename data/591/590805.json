Behind this facade is a largely invisible agricultural labour force, comprised of temporary migrant workers from the Global South. These workers are placed in a system that is inherently precarious and potentially exploitative, wherein their legal status is tied directly to their employer, with no path to permanent citizenship. While the workers pay into Canadian health care and pension plans, they do not benefit from these social goods as temporary citizens. This film aims to make this labour visible, while contemplating the prescribed aesthetics imposed on the landscape within the region. Formally, the film resides at the intersection of photography and the moving image, while embracing the generative structural limitations of early cinema.","popularity":0.1397,"poster_path":"/dAb4j7WyqBrBvAJYtbai6KcqM2q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24726,"logo_path":"/4Ou4PZ9hiEJyICZxk6FfydGIOfb.png","name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":153006,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Columbia Arts Council","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labour/Leisure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3337605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Ermacora","original_name":"Ryan Ermacora","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62425249c740d90089ecb71a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4793223,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dave Pullmer","original_name":"Dave Pullmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a06c097d047ace53b4486","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2870576,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eugenio Battaglia","original_name":"Eugenio Battaglia","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/bUrvKQZldd1BcH6CwpYu1QJU5Rc.jpg","credit_id":"667a06fd5cafacbc073b4b28","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2870576,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eugenio Battaglia","original_name":"Eugenio Battaglia","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/bUrvKQZldd1BcH6CwpYu1QJU5Rc.jpg","credit_id":"667a0707c73f51e3035659c2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658172,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aidan Whiteley","original_name":"Aidan Whiteley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a0757d51b91cc4507693d","department":"Production","job":"Location Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294134,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Milena Salazar","original_name":"Milena Salazar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a069eb7bb8ecbfe8a4e95","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2274100,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeremy Cox","original_name":"Jeremy Cox","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/kt0YbkMMHk8GTf988seJpH1sebO.jpg","credit_id":"667a063736935ac10e8a4e85","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055725,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Gilling","original_name":"Sam Gilling","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a072419835122f8c24222","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Johnson","original_name":"Jessica Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9977f60e0a264ccec44bde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10584834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dAb4j7WyqBrBvAJYtbai6KcqM2q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nUaUElCt0L2ibZHCEufvD9qwZYs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kQHjLAZ2WbCVeEjqy0wj1DVJ2d0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pPS1rYI86Dqf438v0hlNoV4PNVB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinéma du Réel","release_date":"2019-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
