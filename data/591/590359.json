Expanding on Hefner's influence not only as a celebrity figure but as a catalyst for social awareness, discussion and change, Berman continues to break new ground in Playboy: After Dark, Speaking Out in America. In this doc, Berman details the run and lasting influence of Hefner's two short-lived television shows Playboy: After Dark (1969-1970) and Playboy's Penthouse (1959-1960). Part entertainment segments, part talkshows, the programs featured numerous celebrity guests and covered a diverse range of subjects during their respective runs, including race, integration, environmental changes and free speech. With the story told through interviews and a collection of archived footage, this documentary makes it clear how and why both programs deserve their spots in television history.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/rW875tBV26g1vJKm04GwB4tbIrS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hugh Hefner's After Dark: Speaking Out in America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brigitte Berman","original_name":"Brigitte Berman","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/IouXsbCy1RTk63h7RWFPqKMRwq.jpg","credit_id":"5c9799210e0a264cc6c0e795","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rW875tBV26g1vJKm04GwB4tbIrS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":692}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
