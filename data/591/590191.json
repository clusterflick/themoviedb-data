Others are just… assholes. Inspired by Aaron James’ New York Times bestseller of the same name, this documentary investigates the breeding grounds of contemporary ‘asshole culture’ — and locates signs of civility in an otherwise rude and nasty universe. Venturing into predominantly male domain, this film moves from Ivy League frat clubs to the bratty princedoms of Silicon Valley and the bear pits of international finance. Why do assholes thrive in certain environments? What explains their perverse appeal? And how do they keep getting elected?","popularity":0.7927,"poster_path":"/6J1Nk27gILBrOAGEVlysTn26CYC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116255,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Walker
