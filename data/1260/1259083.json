The courtesan Marion Delorme falls in love with the nobleman Didier de Lassigny, although she is still with another nobleman at the time, the Marquis de Saverny. Marion then leaves the Marquis. This leads to a duel between the two aristocratic gentlemen, although duels were strictly forbidden in these circles by Richelieu. When this becomes known, Didier is put in chains and sentenced to death. Marion sacrifices herself for the sake of her new love, but the sacrifice is in vain. Didier, who refused to flee, is finally beheaded by order of the \"red executioner\" Richelieu.","popularity":0.2302,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG Union","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der rote Henker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1930321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Richter","original_name":"Ellen Richter","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/A5A4nGJD67uR4Y3eBeZpooeAKqG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marion Delorme","credit_id":"65f309f399259c01485d0375","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Hofmann","original_name":"Ernst Hofmann","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/4Zlzd4VC8pJFqxduOzpaTL1Ck02.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Didier","credit_id":"65f309fd6dea3a017c7c8fc3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Rameau","original_name":"Emil Rameau","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/bmDdJOtaGjTylM3rhmDbaCFLBMV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Wilhelm","credit_id":"65f30a07d64ac2014b5e037b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Flink","original_name":"Hugo Flink","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gaspard","credit_id":"65f30a11c49048018619f83c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588071,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Victor Heinrich Fuchs","original_name":"Victor Heinrich Fuchs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marquis von Brichauteau","credit_id":"65f30a1d6dea3a01637a3951","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gottowt","original_name":"John Gottowt","popularity":0.2461,"profile_path":"/eFdamjvO75jaUxO29gPesnfBtsP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"L'Angely","credit_id":"65f30a2b470ead017e9fcd5f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Biebrach","original_name":"Rudolf Biebrach","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"L'Affemas","credit_id":"65f30a3999259c018660d31e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Jacoby","original_name":"Georg Jacoby","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a4ec49048018619f883","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Biebrach","original_name":"Rudolf Biebrach","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a54470ead00cb9b8f31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willi Wolff","original_name":"Willi Wolff","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a5beea34d014b12e403","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534764,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jack Winter","original_name":"Jack Winter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a69eea34d0188167316","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13880,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Davidson","original_name":"Paul Davidson","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a71eea34d0164145e9f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1719674,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Willy Großstück","original_name":"Willy Großstück","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a795a78840163d78454","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
