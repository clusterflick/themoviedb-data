It features an interview with Conway from 1996 and Alexander Walker's insights, aiming for objectivity. The narrator also addresses Conway's criminal past and allegations of sexual misconduct, linked to Kubrick's name. Conway died shortly before Kubrick. Cook and Frewin later made \"Colour Me Kubrick,\" a comedy starring John Malkovich, inspired by Conway's story.","popularity":0.3923,"poster_path":"/v5QSA5EC9ys7G1B9oHp1SzT1aaY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78078,"logo_path":"/v2epmtna2GvUyyfiIgyhxGRKUNh.png","name":"October Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Would Be Kubrick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Conway","original_name":"Alan Conway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Conman","credit_id":"65f30597470ead017e9fc898","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":183201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Flynn","original_name":"Barbara Flynn","popularity":0.4998,"profile_path":"/55Y6mkAYwYUQY0imraEwJg2gtn5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"65f30626d64ac2018761c150","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Walker","original_name":"Alexander Walker","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self / Film Critic","credit_id":"65f3074899259c01635ea01d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeb White","original_name":"Zeb White","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65f3075c6dea3a017c7c8cfe","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Algar","original_name":"Nigel Algar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f305ddd64ac201645f8fde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Algar","original_name":"Nigel Algar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f305ed99259c01635e9f73","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Kerr","original_name":"Paul Kerr","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f3077d5a78840186d83c3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"65f307995a78840186d83c47","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737664,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cliff Homow","original_name":"Cliff Homow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f307d7c49048018619f55e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31410914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1320,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hXsDzcuU1Ze5YDCC2YADRAXVQDY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2345}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5QSA5EC9ys7G1B9oHp1SzT1aaY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9468,"name":"liar"},{"id":284794,"name":"conman"},{"id":330074,"name":"stanley kubrick"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
