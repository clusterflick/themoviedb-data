It is in the midst of this fervor that two brothers have the opportunity to collect the large inheritance that their mother has left. The detail, a father who has been missing for 20 years, whose whereabouts are unknown and would have the right to her as well. In desperation to collect the millionaire inheritance, leaving out the “daddy heart” who abandoned them, these brothers are willing to do absolutely anything to get all of the money, which leads them to immerse themselves in a hilarious series of events, fed up with a system that oppresses them.","popularity":0.2517,"poster_path":"/z9B1YVEc1VpG7eVpTGWbrj8vmH8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malas Costumbres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2004128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mayte Rodríguez","original_name":"Mayte Rodríguez","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/DhA25STlwOe6qrOa96HRy7GsFa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65f45789a698cf0186f796d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Loyola","original_name":"Mariana Loyola","popularity":0.2589,"profile_path":"/vNdE5m9ql3FdDGYzBA20oBJtWY6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65f45791293835018729a5f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Pardow","original_name":"Rodrigo Pardow","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65f4579b88055101610f2def","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Lisboa","original_name":"Rodrigo Lisboa","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65f457a53852020186e373f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2210014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Azócar","original_name":"Jaime Azócar","popularity":0.0653,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65f457b31fa1c8017d5ba80f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2102030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseff Messmer","original_name":"Joseff Messmer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65f457ba595a56018606e86e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Mantilla","original_name":"Pablo Mantilla","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f457eb1fa1c8017d5ba834","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Mantilla","original_name":"Pablo Mantilla","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f457f83852020163e263e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2022380,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cristián Freund","original_name":"Cristián Freund","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4580424f2ce018517d117","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162075,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cristóbal Carvajal","original_name":"Cristóbal Carvajal","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4581588055101610f2e69","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2195211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"José Luis Canales","original_name":"José Luis Canales","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f458221fa1c8017d5ba854","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/z9B1YVEc1VpG7eVpTGWbrj8vmH8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":839}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
