The short also showcases the birthplace of the zombie phenomenon: Pittsburgh. Beyond the scares and camp this short also addresses the theme of excess and the need to be more cognizant of how we treat our bodies. My goal with DotLD was to bring levity to the horror genre.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diet of the Living Dead","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Haynes","original_name":"Ted Haynes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f3605e6dea3a017c7d165e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Haynes","original_name":"Ted Haynes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f3606506f98400c9428f3d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
