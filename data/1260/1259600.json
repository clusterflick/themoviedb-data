The small American college town of Moscow is home to just 25,000 people, most of them students, and hasnâ€™t seen a homicide in seven years. For six weeks, the police said they had no suspects, no motive, no weapon, and had found no signs of forced entry into the house.  Zara heads to Moscow to find out how much of what she saw online was even real, and how much was pure speculation. She meets the true crime sleuths making thousands of hours of social media content on this case to find out why they felt the need to post their own interpretation, and why people were so keen to listen to them rather than the network news or the police. Zara also speaks to those who were affected by the rumours spread online and sees the impact this social media storm has had, leading her to question her own role in the tragedy.","popularity":0.0527,"poster_path":"/johQFbkA7BEUdq32QH5rMRQSRPK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Idaho Murders: Trial by TikTok","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3634908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zara McDermott","original_name":"Zara McDermott","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":"/lGNZgkJDDCoSEX96pE19lQyrriN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65f4557aa313b8016226e200","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3DL2txRRjdV5TRg9vTDu9IOh7Gs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2046}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2432,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/johQFbkA7BEUdq32QH5rMRQSRPK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1622}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
