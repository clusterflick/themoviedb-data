Attendees delight in sharing their sometimes obscure & sometimes popular musical (& otherwise) loves.  For mm 49 (in the 37th month of \"mm\"'s history) a marathon listening party celebrating the music of Vivian Fine was decided upon.  Fine was a dedicated composer who produced a variety of work over a 70 year career. This movie, of course, is not an imitation of Ken Burns style documentary movie-making.  Instead, I gleefully mix the casualness & lively uninhibited conversation of mms with the formal exactitude of Fine's music.  I hope you enjoy it as an upstanding example of Punk Classical.  \"Bah to the Bourgeoisie\"!  Note that I'm starting to disappear in this movie - will you miss me when I'm gone?  This is my 111th feature & my 404th movie.","popularity":0.1718,"poster_path":"/kEfud923iqN9DAhV0qpsOqv23W6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
