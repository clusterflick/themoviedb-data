The photograph used is the first ever taken by artist Rojin Shafiei with her film camera in Toronto. The film was developed six years later, after the artist had decided to make Toronto her permanent home following periods of living in Iran, Montreal and Europe. Moving to Toronto with her family in 2009 and accepting it as a second home presented a significant challenge. Rojin continues to be reminded of her immigrant status whenever she thinks of Toronto.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4592081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rojin Shafiei","original_name":"Rojin Shafiei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f3051435818f0188d18c38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
