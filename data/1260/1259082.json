When Emma is commissioned to exhibit at the gallery of her other lover, Zara, she chooses to focus the show on her relationship with River, exploring the timeless bond they share, the messy situations they find themselves in, the joy and the pain of their boundary pushing relationship. As Emma's opening night approaches, River is offered a gig that could put him on the map, but at the cost of missing Emma's show.","popularity":0.0626,"poster_path":"/z6BGReu12cWNXWMisl3IEd3hdMO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Open love is a beautiful mess","title":"Cloudy River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Robertson","original_name":"Rebecca Robertson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65f30b0b470ead017e9fce52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1797700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rowan Davie","original_name":"Rowan Davie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65f30b2299259c01635ea1e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indigo Sparke","original_name":"Indigo Sparke","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65f30b2fd64ac2018761c698","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caeley Wesson","original_name":"Caeley Wesson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65f30b3699259c01485d03cd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236045,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie Hardcastle","original_name":"Sophie Hardcastle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a3b470ead017e9fcd70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Ford","original_name":"Charlie Ford","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30ad95a78840186d83e6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236045,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie Hardcastle","original_name":"Sophie Hardcastle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30ae12fdec6017021f5fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Ford","original_name":"Charlie Ford","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f30a302fe2fa00caecc6aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26987362","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cUqPzso91cg3hVGzYcDKuon41aR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z6BGReu12cWNXWMisl3IEd3hdMO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
