This performance asks why to make in relation to some objects, the uses applicable to a materiality which, although it is inanimate, is activated in relation to a body that alters it. The word volta comes from the Latin volvita, the root of which is linked to the verb tornaré The repeated uses of toves as a metaphor for the process of building and constantly rebuilding memory and identity, a process that is always inexhaustible and unfinished. Bóveda is the iteration of a constant tumbling with bricks, an exercise in resistance and an attempt to create an inescapable memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bóveda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4593037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isla Colectivo","original_name":"Isla Colectivo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f37fdb41465c0185f1f064","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
