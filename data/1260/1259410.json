The intention of the piece is also a homage to some of the artist’s favourite games of all time; the little big planet franchise, and wanted to share how they felt when they were immersed in that world as a child through their art. There is also meaning placed into every ‘sticker’ floating in the film as they all relate to a particular emotion or image that may come to your mind as you create art.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/euuCPTTJDSgxVuVz4jPwafmmRDP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":20000,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where do our thoughts go when we burn out?","title":"Burnout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathon Charlie Copson-Pacal","original_name":"Jonathon Charlie Copson-Pacal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65f3c6941fa1c801965b923d","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/euuCPTTJDSgxVuVz4jPwafmmRDP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
