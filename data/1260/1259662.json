Twenty years after their initial meeting, Bill Ferris returned home to Mississippi in the early ‘70s with a camera.  The result reveals a look back at the colorful rhythms of Ray’s life—at home, at the auction, joking with strangers outside country stores— and provides a glimpse at Southern manhood, friendship and loss. Now nearly Ray’s age when they first filmed, Ferris has become a Grammy Award winning documentarian and renowned folklorist.  Using never before seen 16mm footage and new animations, OKAY, MR. RAY is a short documentary film about how even the tallest tales help us keep the memory alive of the ones we love.","popularity":0.6671,"poster_path":"/mPHkTHDZdBOjAdKLfKN9e38SKAC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You're never broke long as you keep trading!","title":"Okay, Mr. Ray!","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Lum","original_name":"Ray Lum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65f46e8888055101610f3e2c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Square Harris","original_name":"Square Harris","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"669923d688e1d89f340f7560","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellwood Jenkins","original_name":"Ellwood Jenkins","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65f46ea2595a5600cd04c0b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Bobb","original_name":"Victor Bobb","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65f46eafa313b80185281d03","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2920969,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Melzer","original_name":"Ashley Melzer","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f46b6a24f2ce018517e6a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2920969,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Melzer","original_name":"Ashley Melzer","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f46b85595a5601490517cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3886467,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bridgette Cyr","original_name":"Bridgette Cyr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f46b92a313b801852819a9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594362,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rodgers Dameron","original_name":"Rodgers Dameron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f46ba324f2ce018517e6e3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594363,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jake Xerxes Fussell","original_name":"Jake Xerxes Fussell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f46bb0a313b8016226f0d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1871100,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Judy Peiser","original_name":"Judy Peiser","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f46bf6a313b80185281a13","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1871099,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bill Ferris","original_name":"Bill Ferris","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/qUOvY5rgQMOCMeMPDjDSQQ7nuk9.jpg","credit_id":"65f46c0e5b950801491ad727","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836560,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael A.
