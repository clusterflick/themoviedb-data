The film explains how the machine works. This takes place at Upper Abbey Farm. Hand feeding of poultry in the farmyard is shown as well as feeding silage to cattle and the preparation of root crops for cattle feed by Head Stockman, Lacey Smith. The farmyard scenes show a dog curled up on sacks in the barn and the farm cat investigating proceedings. The film moves on to show hedging and ditching by hand, and then the laying of brushwood drains on Wood Farm, Sibton and ends showing winter ploughing by a horse team.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaumont-British Instructional","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farming in Winter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450204,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George W.
