Unfortunately, women are being prosecuted NOW under misogynistic laws, simply for trying to access life-saving reproductive care. In this short film, Tim picks up his mail order bride, Briana, and takes her to his cabin in the Canadian woods. Things do not go well, however, and she escapes. She runs to the nearest place of business seeking help and fortunately meets someone who helps her find a new purpose in life.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":223627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bad Intentions Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mail Order Bride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Lake","original_name":"Matt Lake","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bernie","credit_id":"65f4b551d6c300016358ce68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Wade","original_name":"Sandra Wade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fiona","credit_id":"65f4b55a0443c9017dbc7d97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quinn Assiran","original_name":"Quinn Assiran","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Beth","credit_id":"65f4b5644a52f8017ea0d16f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4453821,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tommy Joyner","original_name":"Tommy Joyner","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"65f4b5790443c90164bc694c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schmalzigan","original_name":"Anne Schmalzigan","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Briana","credit_id":"65f4b5833c887d0181dffd0b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4585976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alana Hill","original_name":"Alana Hill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tina","credit_id":"65f4b59f2222f60186e596cd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Courtney Custer","original_name":"Courtney Custer","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Becca","credit_id":"65f4b5b02222f60186e596ed","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Wade","original_name":"Sandra Wade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4b5ea3c887d0163dfe200","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261933,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oliver Assiran","original_name":"Oliver Assiran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4b5ca3c887d0181dffd5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595116,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Boyd","original_name":"Robert Boyd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4b5fa20ecaf0149d8d024","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Wade","original_name":"Sandra Wade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4b5d84a52f80165a0b71b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4595118,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alan Kelley","original_name":"Alan Kelley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4b60cdcb6a30130322bb6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261933,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oliver Assiran","original_name":"Oliver Assiran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f4b5e159e8a9017c19122b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
