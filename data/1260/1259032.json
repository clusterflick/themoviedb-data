Over the course of 18 months they documented the everyday lives and struggles of the crofters they lived among, whom were even then a vanishing breed. The film is in English and Gaelic.  This carefully observed documentary by filmmakers Jack Shae and Allen Moore is a poetic ethnographic film in the style of their mentor, Robert Gardner (“Dead Birds”). It follows the rhythm of life on a wind-swept island in the Outer Hebrides through the four seasons and in the filmmakers’ observation of the day-to-day struggles of a vanishing society we see the deep-time legacy of their kind. The film is in English and Gaelic.","popularity":0.2283,"poster_path":"/nqGHgUG81x9Wghiz04pSlK2VKp1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8257,"logo_path":"/hoCRsRsG2Ii4NnGc5YjsqQNwAWX.png","name":"The Scottish Arts Council","origin_country":""},{"id":223451,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Highlands and Islands, Development Board of Scotland","origin_country":""},{"id":223452,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Film Study Center, Harvard University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shepherds of Berneray","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f2fc5fc49048018619eb6a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Shea","original_name":"Jack Shea","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f2fc48470ead017e9fc0c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4592000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Moore","original_name":"Allen Moore","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f2fc396dea3a017c7c83be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0289447","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":765,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqGHgUG81x9Wghiz04pSlK2VKp1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1450,"name":"shepherd"},{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":5888,"name":"agriculture"},{"id":281657,"name":"rural depopulation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hof International Film Festival","release_date":"1981-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
