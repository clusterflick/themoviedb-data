He is then awarded a position at center because of his superior method of passing the ball, though his lightness is against him. He overhears the head coach say that Dick Blackwood would make a better center if only he could master the pass. In his loyalty to the college Elliott teaches Blackwood the pass, thereby eliminating himself, not merely from the team, but also, as he supposes, from the possibility of winning Marjorie Burgess, who has commanded him to return for his answer after he has played his first big game.","popularity":0.0737,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":129179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Domino Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scrub","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marjorie Burgess - the Scrub","credit_id":"6207e9a4d7fbda00bcc53218","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Fisher","original_name":"George Fisher","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/gK8RRwzwBGksl3laSh0ALzH2E4F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gordon Elliott","credit_id":"6207e9be297338008beaae06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3423468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James McLaughlin","original_name":"James McLaughlin","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dick Blackwood","credit_id":"6207e9f8af2da80107fbb2f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Durham","original_name":"Louis Durham","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/oVkkxRTKOxmtU9DDHqhffnMbYSt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Coach Sloane","credit_id":"6207ea07c92c5d0091e5ce31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
