Awarded in many festivals (Cork, Venice, Acapulco, etc.), it will be distributed internationally by Rank. This is the beginning of the adventures of Mr Schmtz, a nerdy crook with many faces. Three other short films will display the failed scams of this funny guy. This film, broadcast in 1961 as the first part of cinema sessions, is incredibly modern, benefited by the magnificent sets by Pierre Watrin and very contemporary animation and production. This film, which comes the ages without a wrinkle, was chosen by the second French TV channel (at the time Antenne2) for the transition period to color broadcasting.\" - https://youtu.be/4Req92LU290","popularity":0.057,"poster_path":"/AqZzgTZjpoiMiUnSggMsXpespzX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Villa Mon Rêve","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Bodoin","original_name":"Jacques Bodoin","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/4Ix96v3cYm03l7rQqRvlZYWTBFx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6207c3101cac8c00dfc3f794","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Watrin","original_name":"Pierre Watrin","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207c372ae6f090068f49140","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Condroyer","original_name":"Philippe Condroyer","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207c343af2da8001c07c287","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3529,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Duhamel","original_name":"Antoine Duhamel","popularity":0.0548,"profile_path":"/hvVxYwaaU0TxUCzqh1O3X0HMT3g.jpg","credit_id":"6207c2f0eb79c2001b940938","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Champeaux","original_name":"Albert Champeaux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207c2941d78f2009e9bbdd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":2040,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AqZzgTZjpoiMiUnSggMsXpespzX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1379}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Numéro de visa : 24337","release_date":"1960-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
