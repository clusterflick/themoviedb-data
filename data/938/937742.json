She debuts as the Chinese singer and actress Li Xianglan (Ri Kouran in Japanese), in the hopes that her efforts will work towards the benefit of both Japan and China. Hiding her true nationality, however, she slowly discovers herself becoming a puppet of the Japanese military's propaganda efforts in Manchuria, starring in \"national policy\" films that humiliate the Chinese people. But billed as the \"star of Greater East Asia,\" her popularity soars across borders to Japan, where she holds a concert that draws thousands to the Nihon Gekijou Theatre and leads to a riot that injures several people. Based on her autobiography, this is the story of her personal struggle amidst military strife between her two homelands.","popularity":0.8712,"poster_path":"/hmROCd1IGMTNQzOc65AUszdDSos.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3034,"logo_path":"/jnuO8pZNEBLEq5YaOP1f5OkmG91.png","name":"TV Tokyo","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ri Kôran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aya Ueto","original_name":"上戸彩","popularity":0.7678,"profile_path":"/9r4qBKsyyFWSKTEfMgHYnFfxig1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Yoshiko Yamaguchi","credit_id":"620787c901432500679e4c47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isao Hashizume","original_name":"橋爪功","popularity":0.7807,"profile_path":"/pM8AweTuMvGoWjxPgneHW7siYKy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Yamaguchi Fumio","credit_id":"620787e2e640d6001b08674a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yûko Natori","original_name":"名取裕子","popularity":0.5275,"profile_path":"/2HpVR81BqoZeuz9EJGZyzvnZATy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yamaguchi Ai","credit_id":"620787f8e640d600dcb754e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rei Kikukawa","original_name":"菊川怜","popularity":0.7103,"profile_path":"/h2wVpAnAbGMjsO5j5woE7BYONe1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yoshiko Kawashima","credit_id":"62078810d7fbda00bcc4e4b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shido Nakamura","original_name":"中村獅童","popularity":1.0125,"profile_path":"/5cKT5ZDLyfEuZycVu7kLRDuMRPE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Amakasu Masahiko","credit_id":"6207882601432500dff07f3f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ikki Sawamura","original_name":"沢村一樹","popularity":0.8437,"profile_path":"/2dxA9N1lS5jj7Zou2z1LK5HuN8F.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kawakita Nagamasa","credit_id":"62078838d7fbda009320c7a3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukiyoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小澤征悦","popularity":0.6352,"profile_path":"/eGBjjAmzqlj0fvliJPj93ENoCmr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kodama Hidemi","credit_id":"62078849efd3c200e516da98","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takehiko Ono","original_name":"小野武彦","popularity":0.4625,"profile_path":"/8gcT8znk0l3YVZKvL7eVxYublTl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Yamaga Toru","credit_id":"6207885c9408ec512adec8b4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1685861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonkô Horikawa","original_name":"Tonkô Horikawa","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/isLoV5V871vZJKGHj89d6ZHEPzk.jpg","credit_id":"6207888300508a00929caa75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1171470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hmROCd1IGMTNQzOc65AUszdDSos.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
