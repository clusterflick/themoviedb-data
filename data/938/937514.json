When Burt Hall arrives in town to deliver a will to the heirs of Bruce McClade, he is captivated by Cherry, who learns of Burt's mission. Discovering that the will dictates that Dr. Langdon, a friend of the family, is to receive $25,000, Cherry decides to impersonate Langdon's daughter Rose and thus gain possession of the money. In the meantime, The Stranger, who has been freed from jail, returns, recognizes Cherry as The Siren and kills her. This frees Burt from her evil spell, and The Stranger, now insane, follows The Siren's spirit into the desert.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/8216SjmSdwpx6PIMtFGYL792w2o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Siren","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3422134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeska Suratt","original_name":"Valeska Suratt","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/kMKG8MjSpWfiXwUo4O8G6OY97lF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cherry Millard","credit_id":"6206bcedfab3fa001f6722bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clifford Bruce","original_name":"Clifford Bruce","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/9wxa9dLCxFDCMO2qeCInBFIBUzd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Derrick McClade","credit_id":"6206bcfdcae17c001b1e4abf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1633862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Rea","original_name":"Isabel Rea","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/rx5q7CTT6RMSSkP1q8wXJotupen.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rose Langdon","credit_id":"6206bd19ae6f09009bbd82eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesare Gravina","original_name":"Cesare Gravina","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/dwrv8VttqLIDlp7M5P6fUftRdhd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Her Father","credit_id":"6206bd27af2da800423a4234","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Kaliz","original_name":"Armand Kaliz","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/9XH58hb4mgtyhE5XQYZt8vjHYer.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Armand","credit_id":"6206bd3638e510006a54baca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curtis Benton","original_name":"Curtis Benton","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/j0AlvI7t3eFR7zGHu8uYf1Z2Bz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6206bd4bcba36f0109899d89","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Clugston","original_name":"Robert Clugston","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Burt Hall","credit_id":"6206bd0b38e51011efd3ea43","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rica Scott","original_name":"Rica Scott","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Cherry's Maid","credit_id":"6206bd4438e510006a54baed","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland West","original_name":"Roland West","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":"/tV3RA8ojJQAZTP8BBXBYRA4FgU0.jpg","credit_id":"6206bcc700508a00d65f7095","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552285,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Donald I.
