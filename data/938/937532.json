People trying to get their lives back on track, or simply trying to find out where they went wrong. One of the people staying at this hotel is Wolf, who playfully follows the self-absorbed young Anna around the hotel. No one knows what he did before he came there, though he used to joke that he was an assassin. Anna is a one-hit movie actress who now spends all of her time cultivating \"patrons\" to support her.","popularity":0.4277,"poster_path":"/2k16BO5OzsdsqlrAO5ACXkdpfqJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Appartement Cinéma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2763671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sumire Haruno","original_name":"春野寿美礼","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":"/2UApdwMbqp7VnWfkhHLtXWG5Akb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wolf","credit_id":"6206c8d7d7fbda00686b19d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakurano Ayane","original_name":"Sakurano Ayane","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/3necFOS5w7eSuhBpNicgnPQTo9t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"6206c8e70ce1bc001b664538","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2763675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayabuki Mao","original_name":"Ayabuki Mao","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/vURP7V1EwlZzS0br2CnQyhG6m70.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leonard","credit_id":"6206c90af48b3400666c7a0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1255182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sei Matobu","original_name":"真飛聖","popularity":0.4659,"profile_path":"/onxwXsi3gCZ3z3tkNqQR1wVG8QZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Orlando","credit_id":"6206c912f48b3400666c7a27","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inaba Daichi","original_name":"Inaba Daichi","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206c963cb8028009cff8f64","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inaba Daichi","original_name":"Inaba Daichi","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206c971efd3c200bb927333","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1151,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vjCIy4Atp51rhiJCTAXjRgfX5IN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2047}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2k16BO5OzsdsqlrAO5ACXkdpfqJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"},{"id":290635,"name":"flower troupe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
