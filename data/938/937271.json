She's kept busy taking care of their home in the country, while they plan to marry her off to Joe Dobbs (Lincoln Stedman), the son of the village blacksmith. A wrench is thrown in the Craigs' plan when author Stephen Ware comes to the little hamlet in search of a quiet place to work. Meg immediately develops a crush on him and Ware's stay proves to be anything but quiet when there's a robbery and he is assumed to be the guilty party. A mob attacks him, and Meg steps in and saves his life. Her uncles happen to be away, and she takes him in while he recovers from his injuries. When they return, Donald and Duncan are infuriated to find Ware in their home, and they insist that he marry Meg to save her reputation.","popularity":0.3462,"poster_path":"/pr5H6hM9EXRdoMOiBwh1taqwkWG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1922-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Homespun Vamp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May McAvoy","original_name":"May McAvoy","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/r1twk0uEppt3dhuZqi4Zx7Nq0NP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Meg Mackenzie","credit_id":"6205bf0fdb154f010de3d26f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darrell Foss","original_name":"Darrell Foss","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/i6aa9T0Tfvz67xcY9vS4u0Td31h.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Stephen Ware","credit_id":"6205bf1dd7fbda00931ee612","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lincoln Stedman","original_name":"Lincoln Stedman","popularity":0.2055,"profile_path":"/jj5tbRuTw0RuEezTazYNoILGlHN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joe Dobbs","credit_id":"6205bf2af48b34011dbf233d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Crowell","original_name":"Josephine Crowell","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/tWAM1i3JvmtUQ3BnKXo8mhHknN1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Dobbs","credit_id":"6205bf3a1d78f200db43a062","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ogle","original_name":"Charles Ogle","popularity":0.2381,"profile_path":"/hmSOnMuub9xJ606MsSZEqJg4fXG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Donald Craig","credit_id":"6205bf47559d22006b95275d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Oliver","original_name":"Guy Oliver","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/tLe4A808lGBfSenS42k1ZeAdZEO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Duncan Craig","credit_id":"6205bf56848eb9011185a3d5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Dunbar","original_name":"Helen Dunbar","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/nErEJVdKwRlDuOH6rcBx5isXKWL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Ware","credit_id":"6205bf63efd3c2001cdd7120","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Kirkham","original_name":"Kathleen Kirkham","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/511qexfY0jHo3dj8IJyvlD9AOCk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Beatrice Carlisle","credit_id":"6205bf7138e5100114e9df43","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hector Turnbull","original_name":"Hector Turnbull","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6205bf0038e51000cd487094","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128355,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harvey F.
