Determined to ruin his life, first she tempts the wife with a lounge lizard. This doesn't work, so she temps her former sweetheart by offering him her husband's business secrets. Unfortunately Ann's husband (George M. Adams) overhears the conversation and not only does he ruin the young man in the stock market, he also tosses Ann out of the house. The film ends bitterly for all concerned.","popularity":0.2046,"poster_path":"/ud7AeX2bHGMSiRSrMU4E6icrxfg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jealousy - That terrible form of envy that makes a woman destroy her own happiness and that of others","title":"Jealousy","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3422134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeska Suratt","original_name":"Valeska Suratt","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/kMKG8MjSpWfiXwUo4O8G6OY97lF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anne Baxter","credit_id":"6206acadae6f090042e492d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Walter","original_name":"Lew Walter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Peter Martin","credit_id":"6206acbad95420001bad677b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charline Mayfield","original_name":"Charline Mayfield","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/rCHHFFSIyfK4F0SLDsgvN0mIQdn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Agnes Maynard","credit_id":"6206acc8db154f010de4b2e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curtis Benton","original_name":"Curtis Benton","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/j0AlvI7t3eFR7zGHu8uYf1Z2Bz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Roland Carney","credit_id":"6206acd5cb8028637f4d1196","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Granby","original_name":"Joseph Granby","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Randolph Parsons","credit_id":"6206ace2db154f00a084b857","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George M.
