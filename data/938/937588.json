Integrating semiology and mass media imagery, he employed such strategies as appropriation, deconstruction, decontextualization, sequentiality, and text/image juxtaposition. With an ironic wit, Baldessari's work considers the gathering, sorting, and reorganizing of information.  “Something that is part of my personality is seeing the world slightly askew. It’s a perceptual stance. The real world is absurd sometimes, so I don’t make a conscious attempt, but because I come at it in a certain way, it seems really strange,” Baldessari says in this interview with Nancy Bowen.  A historical interview originally recorded in 1979 and re-edited in 2003 with support from the Lyn Blumenthal Memorial Fund.","popularity":0.9592,"poster_path":"/fP7L7A3kbFzAY71KFhgsvGLHjws.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video Data Bank","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Baldessari: An Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Baldessari","original_name":"John Baldessari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/hkB0IlAKqzDNJlE83ubQSR1ZVpy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6206e50d29733800b9528901","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422481,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Blithe Riley","original_name":"Blithe Riley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206e43c1cac8c0043a85c4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyn Blumenthal","original_name":"Lyn Blumenthal","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206e4d6efd3c2502edea295","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyn Blumenthal","original_name":"Lyn Blumenthal","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206e42b00508a00d65fa32a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Horsfield","original_name":"Kate Horsfield","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206e5e49408ec0042202203","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyn Blumenthal","original_name":"Lyn Blumenthal","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206e5f5eb79c200e6af8a06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fP7L7A3kbFzAY71KFhgsvGLHjws.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":208015,"name":"conceptual art"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":250871,"name":"video artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
