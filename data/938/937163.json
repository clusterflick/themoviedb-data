Lee soon puts matters right, and Corinne gets her fuzzy hair all mixed up with his as he tinkers about. Eddy naturally keeps Louise company and cards are exchanged. Arriving home papa puts a veto on the prospective call of the impecunious young lawyers, as he wants a titled man for a son-in-law. One evening papa goes to the club, and is introduced to Lord Chester, and asks his lordship to call. While papa is thus being entertained, Eddy has called and is enjoying a tête-à-tête with Louise. Corinne spies Lee and introduces him to the butler and the cook and they all have a good time.
