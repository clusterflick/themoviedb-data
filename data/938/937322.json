That’s the question Vulnerable Rally asks of its participants as we cut past the niceties and social graces to which we conform into the very heart of that which makes us human. Our fears, our shames, our frailties, our prejudices—when these shadow parts of ourselves come to light, they not only have the chance to free us, they can also free those who pass us by. And here, connected by our common humanity, we discover we are not alone. Vulnerable Rally is the backdrop of Mikey Pauker’s, RISE, which too is rallying cry for its listeners to rise up both in strength and in vulnerability—a sentiment echoed by the song’s refrain, “Don’t let this world lock you out of your soul.”","popularity":0.2026,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":169694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outside Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"RISE: Music/Lyrics by Mikey Pauker, from the new album ASCENSION","title":"Vulnerable Rally | RISE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikey Pauker","original_name":"Mikey Pauker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62061f1a0f365500cd0e08a0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Diamond","original_name":"Gabriel Diamond","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62061ee3e640d600b44945fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2578612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Candice Holdorf","original_name":"Candice Holdorf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62061efbae6f0900d01edf43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikey Pauker","original_name":"Mikey Pauker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62061f27c56d2d00db9a2f90","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Diamond","original_name":"Gabriel Diamond","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62061f3929733800b951f811","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Diamond","original_name":"Gabriel Diamond","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62061f47efd3c20043b1f1ce","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2578612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Candice Holdorf","original_name":"Candice Holdorf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62061f560f36550041c1a830","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2578612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Candice Holdorf","original_name":"Candice Holdorf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62061f5e15a4a1006c74ca7e","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":267793,"name":"rise"},{"id":292441,"name":"vulnerable rally"},{"id":292442,"name":"mikey pauker"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
