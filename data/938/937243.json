Years later Irene marries John West, the head of a munitions camp. Kate, as fate would have it, happens to run the saloon in the camp and she and Irene become friends, but neither has any idea that the other is her long-lost sister. Matters take a turn for the worse, however, when Kate starts a romance with Cliff, Irene's adopted brother--a relationship that Irene strongly disapproves of. Complications ensue.","popularity":0.1799,"poster_path":"/vbWQRjEkIfh8DrjMGNSv9QeT6Pl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daredevil Kate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Pearson","original_name":"Virginia Pearson","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/5zNG6IdLbUZzZb1Howmj9W9tM8c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"6205a126d7fbda001c4579d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Sutherland","original_name":"Victor Sutherland","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/aBNQYBHWywmHxG8oIfJXjp3volI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cliff Stone","credit_id":"6205a136f48b34011dbef07c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Lee","original_name":"Jane Lee","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/j4i2EcXvI7kGpy8kJ1dNh9vlryi.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Irene's Child","credit_id":"6205a18b9408ec00cc69b6de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minna Phillips","original_name":"Minna Phillips","popularity":0.0734,"profile_path":"/vZiOvrv7ekR0tT8kZ7xMmZJtOc3.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Stone","credit_id":"6205a1a7151c5c001b85ca02","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Lee","original_name":"Katherine Lee","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/6pCzmoTscHPVtQ6SNUFvTu2s9ia.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Irene's Child","credit_id":"6205a199c56d2d00686f5fdc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1488486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Martin","original_name":"Mary Martin","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/7ageYIPVqSOkGcES3xyYgCg4oKx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Irene","credit_id":"6205a1441d78f2006a68db67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Hunter","original_name":"Kenneth Hunter","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"John West","credit_id":"6205a15401432500b6c298bd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred R.
