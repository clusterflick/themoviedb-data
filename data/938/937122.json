John is a favorite in the vicinity, but Barton has the political pull. Things look none too well for John, when Mary Lemon arrives to visit her brother's ranch. Mary is a suffragette. Having come to the country for a rest from men and work, she promptly forms an attachment for John and starts right in to turn a probable defeat into a sure victory. Mary calls a meeting and the boys attend anticipating some amusement. They leave enthusiastic about Clary's charming personality and many of them lukewarm in their adherence to Barton. Mary is not satisfied, election day is at hand and the fight is not won.","popularity":0.128,"poster_path":"/527LevxgOH9bWeR88TU3Q5ij6Ua.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and a Lemon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Lemon - Suffragette","credit_id":"62054e340bc52901024b6330","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald MacDonald","original_name":"Donald MacDonald","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/cnKEuChBpBWcGR5eqlx14chAqsz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Hobbs","credit_id":"62054e56ec0c5800b62cf70e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"62054e21f9a3fb018b467745","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0360759","wikidata_id":"Q15865998","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/527LevxgOH9bWeR88TU3Q5ij6Ua.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
