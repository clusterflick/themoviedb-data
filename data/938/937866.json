Massive forest clearing occurred and resulted in almost the entire forest as elephant habitat being lost to oil mining factories, infrastructure buildings, community gardens and settlements. Loss of habitat causes elephants to enter populated areas and destroy plantations, even people's homes. Until finally a conflict arose between the residents of Karya Indah and wild elephants. This living space conflict occurs almost every day and causes losses and even casualties between the two parties.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/6zypGTcjPluQRdyHkJIeR4w1nJo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169775,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dowohouse Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":123221,"logo_path":"/reyIdDf4M6BNii26BGS7w78vwpl.png","name":"WWF Indonesia","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human vs Elephant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4306565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Afif Fahmi","original_name":"Afif Fahmi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/azvbIN917yF1GeynXZoMgDVBJd.jpg","credit_id":"651e9f1c5b1240011d7d359b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4306565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Afif Fahmi","original_name":"Afif Fahmi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/azvbIN917yF1GeynXZoMgDVBJd.jpg","credit_id":"651e9f39a097dc00ae732976","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3423539,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bendikta Renaningtyas","original_name":"Bendikta Renaningtyas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207f3e9e640d60067cb0da7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3423541,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erwin Prasetya Kurniawan","original_name":"Erwin Prasetya","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207f411c92c5d001b32b8ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2354356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wildan Ma'arij","original_name":"Wildan Ma'arij","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207f44535a61e00bb4b90ed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3423542,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karolus Kerubim Kurnia","original_name":"Karolus Kerubim Kurnia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207f45d00508a0040a94f1e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6zypGTcjPluQRdyHkJIeR4w1nJo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"Vimeo On Demand","release_date":"2020-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
