This documentary offers insight into the life of two of Ireland’s most accomplished and respected rock climbers who have been climbing partners and life partners for over 45 years.  The film follows the couple on a weekend climbing on the iconic cliffs of Fair Head, Co Antrim when Clare attempts the first ascent of a new route. She recalls a time when young women, even intrepid ones like her, were told “girls don’t climb”. Calvin speaks of the changes in practice and equipment since the simpler early days of climbing in Ireland when climbers simply tied a rope around their waist and set off into the unknown. As a climber himself director Cormac Campbell captures the nuances of the climb and deftly inter-weaves breath-taking footage with an intimate but unintrusive interview with this remarkable couple.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calvin and Clare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3420679,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kyle Stuart","original_name":"Kyle Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6204f6bbea37e00119a461a5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3316332,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cormac Campbell","original_name":"Cormac Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6204f6ab0dea6e0113f5f20b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789408,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tiernan O'Rourke","original_name":"Tiernan O'Rourke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6204f6c8e2bca8001b9909cb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Beagan","original_name":"Paul Beagan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6204f6d31da7a60043de9f90","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
