Ray is sternly told that when he possesses $5,000 as a start in life, his suit may be considered. Disheartened, Ray starts for town. On the corner adjoining the magnificent mansion of the broker is a vacant lot on which a sign stating that there are no restrictions as to buildings advertises the lot for sale. An idea strikes Ray. Making for the real estate office, he buys an option for thirty days on the lot. He then visits the Italian section and makes a proposition to Pedro, an Italian, to build him a small shack which he can have, providing he and his family will move into it. A few days later the wealthy broker's wife is astonished to see a rough wooden shack erected on the vacant lot, and Pedro and his numerous posterity its inhabitants.","popularity":0.0705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Universal Ike Junior in the Shack Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Ray","original_name":"Bobby Ray","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/wGHAUJnwzgtuBWl78k1m2r4J4kn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ike Jr.","credit_id":"6206dd0029733800f7ac81ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Louise","credit_id":"6206dd0ef48b340097c58061","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Gallagher","original_name":"Ray Gallagher","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/aC9ZJkTwISgvajJgkq3FqkUY5Ui.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ray Vernon","credit_id":"6206dd1bc92c5d01159c4a03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Moody","original_name":"Harry Moody","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Louise's Father","credit_id":"6206dd2a00508a00676aebca","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0332799","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
