The engagement is announced. Tom Trude, the brother of Mabel, is a sort of shiftless fellow and is exceedingly unlucky at cards. It required but little argument on the part of the acknowledged best man of the community to win Tom over to his gang, as he hopes to make good his losses at cards in some manner other than actual labor. The post office is held up and the sheriff called upon to bring the perpetrators to justice. A lively encounter is followed by the escape and pursuit of one of the men. The sheriff himself takes up the chase and successfully runs down the man. To his consternation, it proves to be Mabel's brother. He passes their home with the prisoner in tow. Mabel argues and pleads, but to no avail, and she finally plays her largest card--her love, against her brother's liberty","popularity":0.119,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sheriff John Allen","credit_id":"6206cee7af2da80107fad2c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1502735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Christy","original_name":"Lillian Christy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yEn7kGIZCIafyZD4V6YTUBq62cL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mabel Trude","credit_id":"6206cef5e640d6001b078a85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Coxen","original_name":"Edward Coxen","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/msS2eq5NpafWYO4W78SQIiVYS7s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Trude","credit_id":"6206cf050ce1bc006aa97406","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":89179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chester Withey","original_name":"Chester Withey","popularity":0.0846,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Outlaw","credit_id":"6206cf14c56d2d006870d311","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","credit_id":"6206ced238e51000cd497d82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","credit_id":"6206ced8cba36f0040901e41","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003092","wikidata_id":"Q20005356","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
