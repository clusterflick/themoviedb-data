Here he meets the rancher's daughter Mary. They soon become fast friends, and the girl's heart is almost broken when, at the end of the boy's holidays, he is to return to the city. Mary makes him promise to write. Back in the city, Dick tries to forget the country girl, and, as he is engaged to Lillian West, life is very gay indeed. Somehow, he cannot forget the little girl back on the ranch. The promised letter, however, is never written. Mary looks every day for the letter that does not come, and her father is very sad to see her pine away. At last he cannot stand it longer, and makes up his mind to go to the city and hunt Dick up.","popularity":0.1487,"poster_path":"/zDl9p4mx6cQDCU9ChbLX18fFUi8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Heart Calls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Moran","original_name":"Lee Moran","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/cCjOjqOukzozEbC9mbCvgKG28Eq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dick Lee - the City Chap","credit_id":"62053dea7ecd28009183ef5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Bassett","original_name":"Russell Bassett","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/pbXbUVDldsRS2WNNdIPEQ1vsvoU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"James Gordon - the Ranchman","credit_id":"62053df7f9a3fb018b4665aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mary Gordon - the Ranchman's Daughter","credit_id":"62053e061da7a6001dd7de52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1470714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Forde","original_name":"Victoria Forde","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/eKZ5rsIgqb6xFS0JfIxMFMylDiv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lillian West - the Ranchman's Fiancee","credit_id":"62053e1385005d00e26a49a6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"62053daafd4f8001078eb3d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215360","wikidata_id":"Q939094","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zDl9p4mx6cQDCU9ChbLX18fFUi8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
