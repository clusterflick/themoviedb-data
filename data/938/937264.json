Norwood's wife Mary, convinced of her husband's innocence, determines to clear his name. Disguising herself as a vamp and infiltrating the underworld, Mary extracts a confession from the real murderer, Pussyfoot Connor, who is duped by Mary into believing that he sees the ghost of the murdered man. Later, in order to have witnesses to the story, Mary takes a midnight dinner with gang leader Jack Frost, arousing the jealousy of Connor, who enters and accuses Frost of instigating the murder. The police, alerted to the scheme, rush in and arrest the criminals.","popularity":0.2182,"poster_path":"/QfztioVNXwreFbH2atmAw0d4Fi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48145,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.
