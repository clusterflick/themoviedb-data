After his fortune has been squandered, however, he woos and marries wealthy Edith Danfield while her sweetheart, James Ashley, is fighting in the trenches overseas. Embittered, Lola decides that from now on she will use men to her own advantage and travels to Florida to seek her first victim. She soon loses heart, however, and is about to commit suicide when Edith's invalid father, Thomas Danfield, convinces her to begin her life anew. The two become close friends and together return home, where they find that Edith, neglected and abused by Walter, has realized her mistake and is longing for James. To provide Edith with grounds for divorce, Lola allows Walter to enter her room, but when he rushes to attack her in a drunken rage, he falls down the stairs and is killed.","popularity":0.2966,"poster_path":"/nxbK5FCWJMJEwgEG157xvEK1kLE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72476,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paralta Plays Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shackled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lola Dexter","credit_id":"6205b4e10ce1bc0104daf993","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Walter Cosgrove","credit_id":"6205b4f0ce5d820018dbf641","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gilbert","original_name":"John Gilbert","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/wibrEasDmipryIht6W6ajxAAQgH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"James Ashley","credit_id":"6205b506ae6f09001ca32525","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Wilson","original_name":"Roberta Wilson","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/y75QzzB1aGKr9qVyuTO6bmnlR19.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Edith Danfield","credit_id":"6205b515efd3c2001cdd5f34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawson Butt","original_name":"Lawson Butt","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":"/ctPkPl6szDxGYplA1cNaMgDy52k.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Thomas Danfield","credit_id":"6205b52acb80280108c7ed71","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herschel Mayall","original_name":"Herschel Mayall","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/r4dM7lkjleHm2TsTaIGwkZoSEB6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henry Hartman","credit_id":"6205b5961e259a0043463b64","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Laidlaw","original_name":"Roy Laidlaw","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Major Duval","credit_id":"6205b5a3af2da800cb3becac","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reginald Barker","original_name":"Reginald Barker","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6205b4b200508a00d65e60a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961279,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lawrence McCloskey","original_name":"Lawrence McCloskey","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6205b4c8d95420001bac9645","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fred Myton","original_name":"Fred Myton","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6205b4d2f48b34001b10f948","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932645,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.
