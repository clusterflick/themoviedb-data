In our initial consideration for this piece, the collective discussed examining the art and fashion worldâ€™s  appropriation of Indigenous design and iconography. The film quickly became about more than acknowledging the distinction between appropriation and recontextualization, which is increasingly less distinguishable in an age of commodification. As Indigenous people, we understand that knowledge comes from our relationship with ourselves, each other, our communities, our animal relatives, and the land herself. In its truest form, this knowledge is without replication. R.E.M Burn is ultimately a reflection on the land that sustains us, the knowledge she offers, and the responsibility we carry to share those teachings for the well-being of future generations.","popularity":0.3231,"poster_path":"/gbZwiybc1QNHkqAtTRzmSk46co8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R.E.M Burn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bawaadan Collective","original_name":"Bawaadan Collective","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62054ce8158c850087061b03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1532,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gbZwiybc1QNHkqAtTRzmSk46co8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1150}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195469,"name":"first nations"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Media City Film Festival","release_date":"2022-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
