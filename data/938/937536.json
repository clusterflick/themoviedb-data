He digs a bear trap, which is covered with boughs and grass. An Indian girl, armed with a bow and arrow, creeps close to a wild turkey, which she brings down. As she runs forward to gather up her prey she falls into the trap. Evans, the trapper, finds her there and on lifting her from the pit, finds that she has sprained her ankle, and takes her to his cabin, and makes her as comfortable as possible. As the shades of evening fall and the pain subsides, the girl drops into a slumber, and loath to awaken her, Evans leaves her in possession of his cabin and, wrapped in a blanket, sleeps outside. In the morning, the girl having recovered sufficiently, he lifts her to his horse, and mounting behind her, proceeds to the Indian camp. On the way he is attacked by a trio of Indians, who fire at him from behind a tree, and the trapper brings down one of his assailants.","popularity":0.359,"poster_path":"/5MKnuc54cVVSgWi7wSU0Pagf317.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bison Motion Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":50574,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Motion Picture","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outcast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Ford","original_name":"Francis Ford","popularity":0.5663,"profile_path":"/v5MKJZbr5kwP7KbLjNgw7Bqwsto.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Evans, a Trapper","credit_id":"6206caa51d78f23c5a0e5d0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Little","original_name":"Ann Little","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mrqXVaieOerBohYDdEPwZYJkl98.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Taluta, the Sioux Chief's Daughter","credit_id":"6206cab4cb8028001ba6a91e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
