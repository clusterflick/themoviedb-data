The film shows John Baldessari in all aspects of his work: as an artist in his studio, with the technicians he collaborates with, as a teacher interacting with his students, as a passionate observer of the contemporary scene and visiting the Biennale in Venice as well as the Basel Art Fair.  This film provides us with insights into the work of a radically modern-thinking artist and sharpens our perception of the often inaccessible world of contemporary art.","popularity":0.231,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pars Media","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Not That: The Artist John Baldessari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684816,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gaby Kull-Neujahr","original_name":"Gaby Kull-Neujahr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62071892297338006775afc9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Schmidt-Garre","original_name":"Jan Schmidt-Garre","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620718a8cb80280108c99806","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2380839,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Bresinsky","original_name":"Thomas Bresinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207187e848eb9001b9c60e9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208015,"name":"conceptual art"},{"id":250871,"name":"video artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
