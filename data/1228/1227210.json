Vladimir Martynov, Sergey Zagniy, Anton Batagov and Pavel Karmanov, despite their creative difference and difference in attitude, communicate closely and, one might say, are friends. These are four completely different people, who, nevertheless, are called “composers of the same blood” by critics.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Bach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4251746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olesia Buryachenko","original_name":"Olesia Buryachenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659925b97d55040096359b48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
