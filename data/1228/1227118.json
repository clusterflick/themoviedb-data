They settled on the idea of shooting with a live, albeit controlled, audience. In the clip, the Beatles are first seen by themselves, performing the initial chorus and verses, and then are joined by the audience who appear as the last chorus concludes and coda begins; the audience sings and claps along with the Beatles through the song's conclusion. Hogg shot the clip at Twickenham Film Studios on 4 September 1968, with McCartney himself designing the set.","popularity":1.3761,"poster_path":"/3tyoaLOQMfIhOmT8rP5tJyoJrWl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3797,"logo_path":"/pG2RaiOwELHvPJnjrPUbwzkTTxc.png","name":"Apple Corps","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beatles: Hey Jude","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McCartney","original_name":"Paul McCartney","popularity":1.1874,"profile_path":"/sCPsv9ueP5UR6BkMSmRDlwbra6S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6598fee17d550402030aa64f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennon","original_name":"John Lennon","popularity":1.1493,"profile_path":"/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6598ff170d11f201a506b8ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Harrison","original_name":"George Harrison","popularity":0.9156,"profile_path":"/zwUO2gnKBnSrKOB9hnhI9GdOX6e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6598ff26bd588b0204572c8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ringo Starr","original_name":"Ringo Starr","popularity":0.5048,"profile_path":"/AlgXb1mKCghI3Bj2T70G1vvAyEg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6598ff330d11f200eedd1c04","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Lindsay-Hogg","original_name":"Michael Lindsay-Hogg","popularity":0.2882,"profile_path":"/bF0N8ses8QGgFpIUssBF9kOgHla.jpg","credit_id":"6598ff7c0d11f20095b2fec3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McCartney","original_name":"Paul McCartney","popularity":1.1874,"profile_path":"/sCPsv9ueP5UR6BkMSmRDlwbra6S.jpg","credit_id":"666dd63d49416773e64bc46e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennon","original_name":"John Lennon","popularity":1.1493,"profile_path":"/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg","credit_id":"666dd635213ededb0ae245a2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Lindsay-Hogg","original_name":"Michael Lindsay-Hogg","popularity":0.2882,"profile_path":"/bF0N8ses8QGgFpIUssBF9kOgHla.jpg","credit_id":"6682fbcb0e74e76418268ae6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Lindsay-Hogg","original_name":"Michael Lindsay-Hogg","popularity":0.2882,"profile_path":"/bF0N8ses8QGgFpIUssBF9kOgHla.jpg","credit_id":"6682fb98969e944cd62bdcf7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7882388","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ioDzOOunB4v17K0ilzah8ggVyCJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nk3O5ZYkRr1xDmawpY9RFltjkDi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":565},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2314,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3tyoaLOQMfIhOmT8rP5tJyoJrWl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1543},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/869iUON7ukqdJLODi714N6gWGN4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1968-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
