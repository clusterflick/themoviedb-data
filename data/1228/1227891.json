The film narrates his experiences during the conflict, his fears, his hunger, which became more acute after 1937 when Madrid was isolated by Franco's troops. The memories of the protagonists are interwoven with archival images and with the testimony of Eduardo Haro Tecglen and several other people, respecting the silences and pauses in which the interviewees relax the emotions that these memories stir up in them. A cinematic beast's blow where life becomes death: the story of a childhood lost in the midst of embers, hunger and blood.","popularity":0.2018,"poster_path":"/yfA5GlbO0HtO9abvq57r4vMSvaL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arde Madrid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4469038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Caeiro","original_name":"Antonio Caeiro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659af50ac995ee01480f997a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4469038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Caeiro","original_name":"Antonio Caeiro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659af51689b5610d3cb9936b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16478336","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1656,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yfA5GlbO0HtO9abvq57r4vMSvaL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1104}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
