His name is Phil and it is simply the copy of the famous science fiction author Philip K. Dick. In a few weeks Phil became famous on the Web and in the author's fan circles. It is presented in several conferences around the world. In late 2005, the head of the android disappeared during a flight America West Airlines between Dallas and Las Vegas. Through the memories of the android and those of the author, the film offers an interpretation of Phil's life.","popularity":0.1562,"poster_path":"/a0zqFDxWJvRfwJFPakazbtqLHJP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I,
