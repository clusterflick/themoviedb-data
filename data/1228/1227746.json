Lampião, who died in 1938, took justice into his own hands in a region exacerbated by agrarian conflict.\r Following in his footsteps, we meet the men and women who are rebelling against the established order and today claim to be his heirs. By holding up the memory of this popular hero, they are resisting ultraconservative President Jair Bolsonaro's attempt to resurrect Brazil's fascist demons.","popularity":0.0583,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aucun homme n'est né pour être piétiné","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Narimane Baba Aïssa","original_name":"Narimane Baba Aïssa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a8975ca4f670095796b3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Roxo","original_name":"Lucas Roxo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a898eca4f6701a43d04fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Narimane Baba Aïssa","original_name":"Narimane Baba Aïssa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a89a24d0e8d01fd9e678e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Roxo","original_name":"Lucas Roxo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a89b9bd588b01a9578015","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Narimane Baba Aïssa","original_name":"Narimane Baba Aïssa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a89f9bd588b00f109da3f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Roxo","original_name":"Lucas Roxo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a8a088741c401a3f1f0d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344582,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rodolphe Molla","original_name":"Rodolphe Molla","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a8a651d1bf402023d6a0c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
