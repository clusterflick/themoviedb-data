The last republican towns located next to Portugal are conquered by General Franco's troops. As in Badajoz and other towns, the repression they unleash is brutal. The support of the Portuguese dictator Salazar for the coup plotters does not make it advisable to flee to Portugal, but for many it is the only way out. In this way, hundreds of people decide to cross the border, closely pursued by the rebels. The usual procedure of the Portuguese authorities is to hand them over to their Francoist allies. However, thanks to the humanitarian intervention of the Portuguese lieutenant António Augusto de Seixas, two refugee camps were created next to the town of Barrancos to house and protect this group of Spaniards.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9zbR6cVmVPKduKgW91YZzMbqER0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los refugiados de Barrancos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paco Freire Magariños","original_name":"Paco Freire Magariños","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a2a0221621d025b12908b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ángel Hernández García","original_name":"Ángel Hernández García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a2a1815959f00ee08e1d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Martín Millán","original_name":"Pedro Martín Millán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a2a2689b56101a4c4419b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Ramos Mena","original_name":"Fernando Ramos Mena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a2a471d1bf402023d50d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4468088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Navarro Millán","original_name":"Antonio Navarro Millán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a2a387e12f00145d867d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27109842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9zbR6cVmVPKduKgW91YZzMbqER0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
