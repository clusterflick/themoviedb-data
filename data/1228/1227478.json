Why is the doll so important and why is the doll world so diverse? Why was the Scientific Research Institute of Toys created in the Soviet Union, by the way, the only one in the world? And why is it abolished now? What have we grown up to be and what will our children be like? Does a lot really depend on toys? On the example of one family, as well as with the help of collectors and artists, psychologists and teachers, documents and chronicles of those years, the film tries to answer these questions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughters-Mothers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianna Daniltseva","original_name":"Marianna Daniltseva","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6599f0400d11f20202ead6af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
