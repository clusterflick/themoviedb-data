Women who participated in the creation of a fairer, more equitable world, building the world of hope we are heirs. Women whose spirits were forged by the oppression and yet took the floor. What they proclaimed has value not only for the past but for the present and the future because it represents the voice of millions of women who came together, unite and continue joining this struggle. They were not content to look, to let do or let pass; but they engaged in their daily work against injustice, misery, poverty, inequity and lack of equality. Women who have fought tirelessly for economic, social, legal and civil equality for all. Because the personal is political. So they lived so and that is why they fought participating in the construction of the Second Spanish Republic, the most democratic period of Spanish past history.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/zqvVU6vqLeR075uNxibkS4PERfX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mujeres en la II República: constructoras de derechos y utopías","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eloína Terrón","original_name":"Eloína Terrón","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a04c98741c40149cfcbea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eloína Terrón","original_name":"Eloína Terrón","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a0513ca4f67014af8041a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5810892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zqvVU6vqLeR075uNxibkS4PERfX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
