During the tragic events in Kosovo in the early 2000s, fifteen Orthodox monasteries and more than twenty churches were burned or destroyed. It is here, as in no other part of the planet, that Orthodox Christians suffer for the Faith. They carry it in their hearts, do not complain about their fate and with dignity endure the trials and sacrifices that have befallen them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Whom the Bell Does Not Ring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigory Ilugdin","original_name":"Grigory Ilugdin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6598e7e3bd588b0093917166","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
