Parker Ito is an Internet artist. Parker Ito is a post-internet artist. Thus speaks Parker Ito himself. Parker Ito does not defy categorization. He loves categories and he loves to apply them to himself. This is why he is hard to pin down. The labels stick to him just as they peel off. Or maybe they simply cover each other archeologically like posters on a billboard. Maybe this is why people call him nicknames instead. Parker Ito loves that, too. When people call him nicknames, he adopts them. Therefore, Parker Ito is not simply a net artist, an Internet artist, a post-internet artist. Parker Ito is no longer simply Parker Ito. Parker Ito thus reappears as Parker Burrito. Parker Ito exhibits as Parker Cheeto. Parker Ito works in the name of Deke2 and Olivia Calix. Parker Ito tweets in the name of Parker’s Poetry LOL: “If I wasn’t me… I wouldn’t be me.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kzIlx3rdPY9Pvz4nYHhiIhWnz8m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Artist as Network","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parker Ito","original_name":"Parker Ito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6599a4dcbd588b01a9573fcf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parker Ito","original_name":"Parker Ito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Director","credit_id":"6599a5a7bd588b0204577152","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Spencer","original_name":"Fred Spencer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6599a5be8741c401a3f1acf2","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kzIlx3rdPY9Pvz4nYHhiIhWnz8m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
