Especially historians and politicians of the new independent states that have appeared in the post-Soviet space. The problem is so acute that some time ago, the first persons of our country instructed a special commission to counteract attempts to falsify history to the detriment of Russia's interests. Next, a group of Russian scientists, historians and political scientists analyzed 187 school textbooks in 12 countries of the former USSR. The conclusions are sad. With the exception of Belarus and Armenia, in all other countries the interpretation of historical events is either biased or the historical facts themselves are falsified.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winners Are Not Judged","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4466983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Kazarova","original_name":"Anna Kazarova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6599266cbd588b01a9570ed1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4466984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitry Sorokin","original_name":"Dmitry Sorokin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659926780d11f20202ea901c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
