For more than a hundred years, the official version has dominated that the millionaire committed suicide. However, how did the relatives manage to bury the suicide at the Rogozhsky cemetery? It is clear that even such a respected family of Old Believers, to which the Morozovs belonged, would have been completely impossible to do this. So, maybe the elders of the Rogozh community knew something unknown to Russian historians? The authors of the picture question the official version, and conduct their own thorough detective investigation in France and Russia. And they conclude that the fatal love of Savva Morozov was to blame for everything.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ostankino","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fatal Love of Savva Morozov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Fatyanov","original_name":"Vladimir Fatyanov","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/34zVoqARnMUxtH1S4rAAPDiHsIN.jpg","credit_id":"6598defd6e938a00931b1128","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Pavlov","original_name":"Mikhail Pavlov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6598df956e938a00931b117e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
