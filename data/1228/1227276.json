In the middle of the Yi Dynasty, when the government's national defense power was weakened and the people's livelihood was in ruin due to the actions of Tamgwan-ori, barbarians from the north began an invasion, putting the country's fortunes in jeopardy. Accordingly, Hong Jeong-seung, Hong Gil-dong's biological father and a member of the Left Council, organized the Hwalbin Party and recommended Hong Gil-dong, who had committed crimes against the country, to the king, and the king willingly appointed him as the vanguard of the Northern Expedition and sent him on a campaign.
