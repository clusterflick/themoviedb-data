This is Europe's last wilderness and possibly the most gun-tight society in the world. What brings people here? What is it that fascinates? Why is it so difficult to leave here once you are bitten by the famous \"polar bacillus\"? The director Lisbeth Dreyer stayed on Svalbard for several years. In this film, she asks questions and gets many answers - in the face of one of the world's most northerly settlements and a magnificent, white, beautiful and dangerous nature.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bergen Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Magic","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisbeth Dreyer","original_name":"Lisbeth Dreyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a21c321621d02023564a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9894554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
