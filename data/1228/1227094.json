About the great shrine of ancient holiness, martyrdom and new martyrdom. The story begins with the history of the monastery's creation, six centuries ago, since the appearance of the Venerable Savvati, Herman and Zosima on the island. The chronicle footage tells about the terrible period of the archipelago, when a special purpose camp was set up there since 1928, about the terrible suffering and torment that the prisoners endured. About monasticism, and, of course, about the present day of the monastery.","popularity":0.1595,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Place is Sacred Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murad Ibragimbekov","original_name":"Murad Ibragimbekov","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6598ed470d11f200eedd119e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pavel Finn","original_name":"Pavel Finn","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/j8tEEr84oxT0tV9197rnI4W2c29.jpg","credit_id":"6598ed51bd588b00f1093fde","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":339652,"name":"the solovetsky monastery"},{"id":339653,"name":"solovetsky islands"},{"id":339654,"name":"northern russia"},{"id":339656,"name":"christian citadel"},{"id":339657,"name":"soviet prison"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
