In true privacy, she opens up like never before to André Robitaille. From Acadia, where she was born via the cabarets of Montreal and Paris, she lives her life at a hundred miles an hour. At 75, she still dreams of touring, of music, and above all of telling her audience about herself in song. Over the course of the interview, they reflect together on the price of fame, on money, on her life which was marked by an extraordinary youth.","popularity":0.1707,"poster_path":"/3XjjIPDbHzG5CZqtD4ViUDdQxD7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98063,"logo_path":"/6pJHLzacmMUkLipsUSFl4p1Kxte.png","name":"Pamplemousse Média","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":72564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tou.tv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patsy Gallant: droit devant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1970740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patsy Gallant","original_name":"Patsy Gallant","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/wEKmpqWKJI3sRJbt80cXKyCf6LP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659b3539a1074b0093d5a3b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Robitaille","original_name":"André Robitaille","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/uveNtuNUrdjotsOhTqE6Oi2nMaJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"659b35441d1bf400f3a04646","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3340139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxime Rivet","original_name":"Maxime Rivet","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659b356315959f014a60dff2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4469612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mélanie Brunet","original_name":"Mélanie Brunet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659b35afbd588b4df804affd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Robitaille","original_name":"André Robitaille","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/uveNtuNUrdjotsOhTqE6Oi2nMaJ.jpg","credit_id":"659b35b621621d020235a1c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3XjjIPDbHzG5CZqtD4ViUDdQxD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
