Guímara: la represión colectiva de un pueblo","overview":"The military uprising of 1936 tried to eradicate all traces of the social transformation that had brought the Republic. There were villages like Guímara, in the Valley of Fornela (León), whose almost unanimous support to the Republic supposed a hard and systematic repression. This isolated village, of about 85 neighbors, suffered one of the most painful forms of punishment: deportation of adults to concentration camps, separating them from their minor children. In this documentary it is told the chronicle of this terrible repression that sought to subdue and subjugate the population through fear, trying to destroy family ties, solidarity networks between the people and personal and collective subsistence economy. The memory of lullabies from their mothers was the echo that reached their children from the forced exile who lived their elders.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/5Lv2e6dfm0z3j3goOaqg3bp2yaY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nanas sin Pan.
