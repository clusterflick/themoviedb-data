Borges in his work “A History of Eternity”, “eternity is a simpler and more magical thing: it is the simultaneity of those times… The past is in its present, as is the future.”  In the short film, a metaphor is created with the “leaf” of a tree that withers and falls onto the “leaf” of paper, which is in turn a score of J.S. Bach’s Prelude in B-flat minor, which incidentally is played throughout the journey of the protagonist, the “leaf”. The timeless rhythms of Bach’s genius resonate, that immortal genius who centuries ago left his legacy on the eternal “leaves” of his scores, transcending time.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Chatski","original_name":"Ekaterina Chatski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6599aeea6e938a00ee4cc958","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Chatski","original_name":"Ekaterina Chatski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6599af2715959f009593111a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Chatski","original_name":"Ekaterina Chatski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6599af5189b56101a4c41b28","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Chatski","original_name":"Ekaterina Chatski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6599af0f1d1bf400971ae1cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Chatski","original_name":"Ekaterina Chatski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6599af3b5b124001a2caf3f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
