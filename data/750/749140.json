In all her relationships, there was always a turning point, when things started going downhill. On the streets of Zurich Liv faces her fears, joys and demons.  In her third feature film, Swiss director Anna Luif tells the tragi-comical trajectory of an independent woman who learns to love on life’s emotional rollercoaster. A rhythmic, colourful, collage-like journey into the mind and soul of modern women.","popularity":0.6196,"poster_path":"/2UZEzrOgCysI3VHL9KHalYbNHZt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97696,"logo_path":"/s7Kvup5z3ElMyDRe7UZDFHxKlbB.png","name":"Beauvoir
