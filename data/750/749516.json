In 1978, Debbie, then 8 months pregnant, and many other MOVE family members were arrested after an attack by the Philadelphia Police Department; born in a prison cell, Mike Africa Jr. spent just three days with his mother before guards wrenched him away, and they spent the next 40 years struggling for freedom and for each other. In 2018, Mike Africa Jr. successfully organized to have his parents released on parole. “I realized that I had never seen her feet before,” was a remark he made when he reflected on Debbie’s homecoming. This film meditates on Black family preservation as resistance against the brutal legacies of state sanctioned family separation.","popularity":0.1183,"poster_path":"/bLmBngG9QhNiAr1bzSqxYgVP5vZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Free Now, You Are Free","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2802180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ash Goh Hua","original_name":"Ash Goh Hua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6348810afc5f06007f420cb6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2802181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jude Chehab","original_name":"Jude Chehab","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f78d02f3e2ec80034cc2f2d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2730695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arielle Knight","original_name":"Arielle Knight","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f78d07099d5c3003ac15a3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2802180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ash Goh Hua","original_name":"Ash Goh Hua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f78d00ce039f10036e7a6bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13210518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bLmBngG9QhNiAr1bzSqxYgVP5vZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BlackStar Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS Short Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
