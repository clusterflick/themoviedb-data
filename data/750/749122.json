He converted this modest space into a barber’s shop. Kingsley is keen to start an import and export company and to register it officially in Guangzhou. He works every day until 11 pm then goes to sleep in a chair at McDonald’s. He must also send money to his wife, so despite all his efforts, he is still unable to put aside enough money to register his business. In mid-November 2019, he goes back to Lagos to renew his visa. There, he and his wife rent a small stall in the Ikotun Market in the suburbs. But business is hard. Early in 2020, Kingsley is due to head back to China to continue his quest, but with all travel blocked by the Covid-19 epidemic, he remains stuck in Nigeria. Meanwhile, in Guangzhou, the director meets Evelyn, a Nigerian woman, trying to survive with her 6-year-old daughter and with another one on the way.","popularity":0.1596,"poster_path":"/8LtbYi7dX0mSp51dh5ZKG7aTM62.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2606,"logo_path":"/2KJaKgKrsJE3JXpp2pf2TQpxomf.png","name":"Idéale Audience","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":124966,"logo_path":null,"name":"WIL Productions","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"I Come From Ikotun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016314,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Glachant","original_name":"Isabelle Glachant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6EWHIIvymsGsbOjfezjq3oIi4hg.jpg","credit_id":"66422b35fe5e736bde0c61fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"5f7752d63429ff0037b12cd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1563941,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hélène Le Cœur","original_name":"Hélène Le Cœur","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7752e73429ff0036b34aac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":116630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre-Olivier Bardet","original_name":"Pierre-Olivier Bardet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7752f33429ff0036b34b18","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":939107,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kong Lihong","original_name":"Kong Lihong","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7753019a64350037a49114","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12824908","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LtbYi7dX0mSp51dh5ZKG7aTM62.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
