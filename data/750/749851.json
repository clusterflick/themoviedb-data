In this four-part documentary series, native people share ecological wisdom and spiritual reverence while battling a utilitarian view of land in the form of government megaprojects, consumer culture, and resource extraction as well as competing religions and climate change.  Narrated by Graham Greene, with the voices of Tantoo Cardinal and Q’orianka Kilcher, the series exposes threats to native peoples’ health, livelihood, and cultural survival in eight communities around the world. Rare verité scenes of tribal life allow indigenous people to tell their own stories—and confront us with the ethical consequences of our culture of consumption.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6xU4IPQ9Ij6XPj9IMvP129ixCEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standing on Sacred Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2925992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":2274,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6xU4IPQ9Ij6XPj9IMvP129ixCEe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1621}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
