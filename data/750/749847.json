In 1775, the Habsburg Queen, Maria Theresa, sent a hundred foresters and their families here from the Austrian west of the kingdom. All that remains today of the now over two century-old timber industry are factory ruins, potholes in the valley road and an increasingly seldom heard German dialect. Only a few factories survived a flood that cut the village off from the rest of the world, and left it economically isolated. An atmosphere of farewell hangs heavy in the air.","popularity":0.4131,"poster_path":"/2p2BkJp9pZivTrUXpw8S5W0BBpc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141304,"logo_path":null,"name":"LUKASPIT Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Austrians","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sojma","original_name":"Peter Sojma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f7a371243cd540035513c67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitali Fedak","original_name":"Vitali Fedak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f7a37208741c4003774a6c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Horkawtschuk","original_name":"Joseph Horkawtschuk","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f7a3732197de40036751c3e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Kais","original_name":"Elisabeth Kais","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f7a373c1fd36f00384e679c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Pitscheider","original_name":"Lukas Pitscheider","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a18a142bf010036040c1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250408,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steven Heyse","original_name":"Steven Heyse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a37637b7b4d00387012c7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460187,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Johannes Schellhorn","original_name":"Johannes Schellhorn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a37708741c4003774a776","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803468,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Werner Weitschacher","original_name":"Werner Weitschacher","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a377f197de4003575b6f6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595287,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Otger Kunert","original_name":"Otger Kunert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a378e7b7b4d003a738e6b","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2140897,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Andermann","original_name":"Stefan Andermann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a379dda10f0003577da3e","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803470,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Bakanic","original_name":"Christian Bakanic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a37a87b7b4d003a738e82","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Pitscheider","original_name":"Lukas Pitscheider","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a37b57646fd00363a38e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803472,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Klemens Bittmann","original_name":"Klemens Bittmann","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a37c0d5ffcb0034a1d968","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2568255,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christofer Frank","original_name":"Christofer Frank","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a37cd1fd36f00384e68d9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14670028","wikidata_id":"Q116737878","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2p2BkJp9pZivTrUXpw8S5W0BBpc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1842,"name":"village life"},{"id":5331,"name":"village"},{"id":218042,"name":"minority"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zurich Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
