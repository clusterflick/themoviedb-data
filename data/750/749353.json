The filmmaker follows them for several days, as well as a smuggler, André, who earned his living for more than twenty years by organising the transport of migrants between Agadez, in Niger, and Sabha, in Libya. The migrants talk about their hopes, their dreams, the difficulties of the travel. Sometimes they play, cook or dance. They are still human.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/f3erJiHiEtfokjEl8kNwMqHse2i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teghadez Agadez","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2801559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgane Wirtz","original_name":"Morgane Wirtz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f78453843cd5400364aaa34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f3erJiHiEtfokjEl8kNwMqHse2i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":643}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
