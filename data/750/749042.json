Even though he often has to work at night, he leads a more or less settled life until he meets Nina. Nina, who is blind from birth, works as a switchboard operator at the post office. Her life as well is settled, and more so than for Kain the order in her life is a system of security for her.\r They fall in love and as time passes Nina gets much more involved in Kain's life as a musician than she wanted to.","popularity":0.1232,"poster_path":"/jllR0Fpq2DKY01QJg6HDd7d61Ri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141166,"logo_path":null,"name":"JUPITER-Film und
