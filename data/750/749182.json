Isaac was one of three Israeli patriarchs, having died at the age of 180, after a peaceful life in Canaan, which would have been a lot shorter had his father sacrificed him on Mount Moriah as a young man. Fábio Silva revisits this precise famous biblical episode in “The Death of Isaac”, offering an alternative version in which matriarch Sara’s calls for divine intervention were not enough to make Abraham back down from his test of faith and obedience to God.","popularity":0.0836,"poster_path":"/8OIefyEXtrjW4ghxYVdGoVQD1Uf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2020-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death of Isaac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Marques","original_name":"André Marques","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/mMSQwqxApIKAPTJ5tFmOCeu0Flu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"619e793831032500436bd785","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3184187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberley Pearl Febich","original_name":"Kimberley Pearl Febich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"619e795203bf840089a7965a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Silvestre","original_name":"João Silvestre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"619e795a63536a0043a68169","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Silva","original_name":"Fábio Silva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f777b3c021cee00352c029d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Silva","original_name":"Fábio Silva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a28c8e9da690037eae682","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1684,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OIefyEXtrjW4ghxYVdGoVQD1Uf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1191}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186,"name":"christianity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Curtas Vila do Conde","release_date":"2020-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
