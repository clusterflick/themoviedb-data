Performers featured include Gerald Finley, Peter Savidge and Josephine Barstow. The conductor is Kent Nagano.  As pertinent now as then, OWEN WINGRAVE was composed by Benjamin Britten at the height of the Vietnam War. The opera poses the question: Is pacifism an act of cowardice? Or rather a desire to escape from the spiral of war and create world peace? To what extent do we determine our own futures? Should we let past events inform the decisions we make? Brittenâ€™s characters grapple with timeless issues in this gripping psychodrama.","popularity":0.3173,"poster_path":"/ovNhJ29ZII8fMC0plfzm1wPFrDT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2327,"logo_path":null,"name":"MJW Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Owen Wingrave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Owen Wingrave","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Benjamin Britten: Owen Wingrave","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Finley","original_name":"Gerald Finley","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/EwljhDl70GjWTicg3bR5sxFzXL.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Owen Wingrave","credit_id":"5f7817928741c4003871fc0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Savidge","original_name":"Peter Savidge","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Spencer Coyle","credit_id":"5f7817a46728a8003bff55f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Hellekant","original_name":"Charlotte Hellekant","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Kate Julian","credit_id":"5f7817b1944a570037c90625","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1676839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Barstow","original_name":"Josephine Barstow","popularity":0.0427,"profile_path":"/4gg675VuoTNubf8tjKUQhkyOu5N.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Mrs Wingrave","credit_id":"5f7817bf9a64350039adf977","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Hill","original_name":"Martyn Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Gen.
