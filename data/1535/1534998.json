According to the Gaza Health Ministry, 471 people were killed and 342 injured.  In the hours after the explosion, doctors who treated the wounded held a news conference at nearby al-Shifa Hospital, among the bodies of some of those killed in the blast.  There, the British-Palestinian surgeon Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah spoke, flanked by colleagues. ‘This is a massacre’, said Dr Abu-Sittah, before predicting that ‘more hospitals will be targeted’.  Later, Dr Abu-Sittah would tell us that the blast at al-Ahli Hospital was the moment when it seemed clear to him that Israel’s military campaign ‘stopped being a war, and became a genocide’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When It Stopped Being A War: The Situated Testimony of Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab18b5e219478700448ca5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
