The disembodied voice of the judge rings out, demanding to know why Lucheni killed her. Lucheni responds, in his own defense, that he was doing her a favor as Elisabeth and Death were lovers. He calls upon the ghosts of Elisabeth's family and friends to corroborate this statement. Death appears in their midst, a pale, androgynous, eternally youthful man who admits that he was in love with Elisabeth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/r1VyJhD327Xk7KR7IPI8V95jQ6g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Elisabeth ~The Rondo of Love and Death~","title":"Elisabeth ~The Rondo of Love and Death~","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1924413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomu Ranju","original_name":"蘭寿とむ","popularity":0.1881,"profile_path":"/ch2AIU7rXSOBWhnnFUA1z1Lb5ZI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Der Tod","credit_id":"68aa137beab92453cb6ce195","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4076766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toono Asuka","original_name":"遠野あすか","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/ej07m3vw5BJ9jsBz9E1Lj1ITbop.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elisabeth","credit_id":"68aa1396227a2c386a8d1c1f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misuzu Aki","original_name":"Misuzu Aki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Franz Joseph","credit_id":"68aa13b29f4594a97666fe33","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aine Harei","original_name":"Aine Harei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rudolf","credit_id":"68aa13ebb63d261ce44488b4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122749,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Kunze","original_name":"Michael Kunze","popularity":0.1315,"profile_path":"/11tyF03oUMme3K3t9wL034l0laV.jpg","credit_id":"68aa18a2c09a0b6a3f66feeb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3945070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ueda Keiko","original_name":"植田景子","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa18f5a5404a394e1e4b6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":879,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r1VyJhD327Xk7KR7IPI8V95jQ6g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":586}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
