The series’ original eight episodes trace the legendary journey that began in Liverpool and Hamburg and soon captivated the world. They bring to life the timeless stories — of Beatlemania, the band’s groundbreaking arrival in the USA, their role at the forefront of the 1960s counterculture, their spiritual exploration in India, and their eventual breakup. And through it all, the constant thread: the music, always the music.  There is now a completely new Episode Nine, including unseen behind-the-scenes footage of Paul, George and Ringo coming together between 1994 and 1995 to work on “The Anthology” and reflecting on their shared life as The Beatles.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/eMH4Nqf8Q4YMmV9a2UirPYhVAjW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3797,"logo_path":"/pG2RaiOwELHvPJnjrPUbwzkTTxc.png","name":"Apple
