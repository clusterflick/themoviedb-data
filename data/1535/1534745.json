He holds a degree in Philosophy and was a university professor at the University of Buenos Aires during the military government of Juan Carlos Onganía. During those years, he forged his identity as an intellectual of the so-called leftist Peronism. During the last military dictatorship, Feinmann lived in seclusion with a diagnosis of cancer. Hence the analogical relationship in the title. The Fugitive Cell refers to the symmetries the author and screenwriter establishes between the illness that plagued him and the feared paramilitary groups whose eruption awaited him at any moment, locked inside his Buenos Aires home.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La célula fugitiva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1769538,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mariana Russo","original_name":"Mariana Russo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa5291a5404a394e1e4c59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José Pablo Feinmann","original_name":"José Pablo Feinmann","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa52a76fa7bc3adba99d52","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644647,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alejandro Ortíz","original_name":"Alejandro Ortíz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa52dacdbf8cca73670109","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644648,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Clavel","original_name":"Rita Clavel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa52edadf8b0473d66ffa3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194958,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Horacio Almada","original_name":"Horacio Almada","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa530568d62872b38d1d14","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0424927","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
