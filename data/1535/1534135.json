However, the Sahrawi nonviolent activists argue that they are pushing Morocco to an untenable position. For them, the nonviolent action and the respect of human rights make Sahrawis part of the new world that is coming and also they are building a sane society. The documentary explores this debate with activists of the refugee camps and of the occupied territories.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4ZsXmXiB3F4HJRiYgnqmN3oVmWi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transform Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rofles or graffiti: the non-violent fight of the Sahrawi people","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5642474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordi Oriola Folch","original_name":"Jordi Oriola Folch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a8b48e6875c794518d1601","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4ZsXmXiB3F4HJRiYgnqmN3oVmWi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":917,"name":"journalism"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":356811,"name":"occupied territories"},{"id":357565,"name":"media blockade"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
