These survivors lived today in Argentina and are members of “Children of the Shoah in Argentina”. Their multiple voices speak about the pain of having been kept apart from their biological families and having lived their childhood in forced silence. They tell us how they were rescued by their saviors, and of their gratitude towards them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mklGPLc6tRfI1zidLJz4wjEkqkw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2003-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aquellos niños","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernardo Kononovich","original_name":"Bernardo Kononovich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa21de6da88df8dba99bc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernardo Kononovich","original_name":"Bernardo Kononovich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa21e5cbf738a6a91e4bba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644356,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Graciela Jinich","original_name":"Graciela Jinich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa21fbbdd4f40c236ce176","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644399,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Diana Wang","original_name":"Diana Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa2a05e8163640b3781adc","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296460,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"César Lerner","original_name":"César Lerner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa2a1feec42045218d1b52","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644428,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mercedes Ardiles","original_name":"Mercedes Ardiles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa2d7d6875c794518d1adc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3807000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucía Iglesias","original_name":"Lucía Iglesias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa2d92b0fe6e4f019da9bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457139,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonatan Feldman","original_name":"Jonatan Feldman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aa2dafea8d770c4d547c6f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0826029","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mklGPLc6tRfI1zidLJz4wjEkqkw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
