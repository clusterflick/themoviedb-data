Band of Sisters is a retro feeling snapshot of the march filmed in multiple 16mm film stocks using a 1960’s Bolex film camera. Capturing a moment that is both specific and timeless, the film illustrates with basically no dialogue, the divisiveness, passion and stagnation of a national issue that proves to be just as pivotal today as it was 20 years ago.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tHVMO7IdbhSaz0o2pmTsw71cJvT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Band of Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Fendelman","original_name":"Joel Fendelman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a9fe93a628d42a6144867b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2193,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tHVMO7IdbhSaz0o2pmTsw71cJvT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1548}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
