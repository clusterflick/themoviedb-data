From her childhood in Los Mochis to the impact of fame and her retirement from the stage, the film explores, with honesty and sensibility, themes such as bullying, boundaries, and resilience. Through archives, testimonies, and new songs, Denisse reveals herself not as an icon, but as a complex woman who decides to rediscover herself and live her personal and artistic reality.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/87s43JGfXVMyP2L2cVozpau0XpN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Music (MX)","origin_country":""},{"id":156389,"logo_path":"/aZnkhRIt1LioMqXehLZmOF99V8O.png","name":"Cobrafilms","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":256613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bunker Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2025-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murió la Fantasía","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2593710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denisse Guerrero","original_name":"Denisse Guerrero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68a936560a3ad769cb8d18b4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134174,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ruben R.
