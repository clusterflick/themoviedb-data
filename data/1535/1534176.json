The writer Roparz Hemon is one of its emblematic figures. He was born in Brest in 1900, and died in Dublin in 1978 after thirty years of voluntary exile in Ireland following his trial for collaboration at the end of the war. He had indeed organised the first Breton-language radio programmes under German control. The work of this poet, novelist, and translator of Shakespeare and Cervantes is dominated by the theme of the dream.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z91H92GO3RyGwHR6ekm9qKsBjL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237036,"logo_path":"/fxt1YpiNp5wXuyhlgA2pQy5l4H5.png","name":"Kalanna Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":150843,"logo_path":null,"name":"France 3 Ouest","origin_country":""},{"id":20346,"logo_path":"/UQrxBqPABvkwempcU9kvOjksVU.png","name":"Région Bretagne","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Breton","iso_639_1":"br","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roparz Hemon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5641028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soazig Daniellou","original_name":"Soazig Daniellou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/44M3npZXol2q6R3mQ1cpIldoq3a.jpg","credit_id":"68a8c43b92c1b40d406cdbab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5641028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soazig Daniellou","original_name":"Soazig Daniellou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/44M3npZXol2q6R3mQ1cpIldoq3a.jpg","credit_id":"68a8c44ace6d589e929da4f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z91H92GO3RyGwHR6ekm9qKsBjL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":794}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2132,"name":"literature"},{"id":13028,"name":"writer"},{"id":14905,"name":"britain"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":191726,"name":"nazism"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":357512,"name":"bretagne"},{"id":357513,"name":"breizh"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"br","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
