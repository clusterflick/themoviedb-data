Through the creation of bold, glittering mask jewellery, Sara transforms a symbol of survival into one of defiance and hope. This intimate documentary weaves together disability, activism, and fashion, and invites us to reflect on what it means to make space—visibly, beautifully—for those most often pushed aside.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pretty Sick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zed Von Benzon","original_name":"Zed Von Benzon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a9e5a13fcea4610d9daa81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5644004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aster Emschild","original_name":"Aster Emschild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a9e5c5a3c947ac5b8d1b18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
