They discuss their remarkable history, their poetic life style and their strong morals. They recount the horrific Moroccan invasion, which forced them into the Algerian refugee camps. This is a powerful and unique movie, which not only preserves the Saharawi people’s personal and cultural history as nomads, but also documents what it means to be a “state-less” person. It is a human rights plea to a world, which has been sadly silent on the long time abuse of the Saharawi people. When the Sun Came for Them documents what it means to be a “state-less” person and how after decades of abuse even pacifist Muslims are turned into fighters committed to war. It is a timely and important film. All was shot by a crew of three recent college graduates on two iPads. It is true backpack journalism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xMbzv5fFmwv1hYU8ABUjAd5fG80.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the sun came for them","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5642505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terrence Ross","original_name":"Terrence Ross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a8b9a34f457c2748448206","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xMbzv5fFmwv1hYU8ABUjAd5fG80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":777}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":941,"name":"tradition"},{"id":356810,"name":"sahrawi refugee camps"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
