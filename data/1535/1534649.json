The Napoleonic Wars become the background for the lives, ambitions, hopes and sorrows of the open-hearted Rostovs, the honorable and uncompromising Bolkonskys, and the arrogant and ravishing Kuragins. Tuminas creates, explores and comprehends destinies, paradoxes, madness, love, joy and despair. The world he presents to the audience is a beautiful, aesthetic, theatrical and fragile one, but one at constant risk of being destroyed by the ominous comet that is already in the sky above.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":271,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"War does not determine who is right - only who is left","title":"Rimas Tuminas’ War and Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
