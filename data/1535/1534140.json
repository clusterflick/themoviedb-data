She endured severe torture and a 10-year prison sentence, during which she documented the stories of her comrades and fellow prisoners. After her release, she returned to her hometown and now resides in the former NKVD prison building, which is now a Caritas shelter. Despite the haunting memories, Maria’s spirit remains unbroken, and she has become a writer dedicated to preserving and sharing the stories of those who sacrificed their lives for Ukraine’s freedom.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6pnZQ5XpTV6ZVhGEpNY8YsLoKEW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Жива УПА 4","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Maria.
