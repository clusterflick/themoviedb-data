While the first film imagined his final hours in a surreal version of Stockholm, Epilog takes us further—into the world he longed to escape to. Pasolini had planned to move to Morocco, to live, write, and disappear from Italy’s gaze. But his death ended that story too soon. PPPasolini Epilog is the imagined afterlife of that plan: a haunting, sensual film filled with echoes of Petrolio, his unfinished novel, and reflections on exile, desire, and creation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iVwMdHyD4vF2cmJfgjZ4XjRvQXX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PPPasolini
