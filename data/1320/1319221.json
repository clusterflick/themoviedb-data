The letter speaks of the gap between me and my heritage because my parents emigrated. In the letter, I ponder this separation and what it means to have roots to a specific place on earth while I also consider the incredible changes that have taken place in the last century,what my grandmother lived through, without the technology we have today, or the scientific knowledge that has greatly improved survival rates for women and babies in childbirth. All of this comes at a cost though, as we are destroying the planet, so looking to our past may be crucial to help reconnect us to the earth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porthole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Wadsley","original_name":"Helena Wadsley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669bd72619152727778eacc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
