He loves Clarice Penlow, a singer in a local choir, who loves him, too, but is put off by his \"wild\" lifestyle. When Prohibition takes effect, Clarice wants Carter to become a Prohibition agent, thinking that having to enforce the laws that he spent much of his life breaking will change his outlook. He accedes to her wishes out of his love for her--but complications ensue.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":234388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loyalty Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reformation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney P.
