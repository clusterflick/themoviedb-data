Echoing Maya Deren’s time in Haiti, the film follows a European contemporary dancer’s thoughts as she describes a trance like experience and perceived connection with an online deity after repeatedly performing to a song via YouTube. Collaged, overlapping footage of the female body is witnessed with a kaleidoscopic textile of sampled songs, signalling both the liberatory and contradictory parameters of bodily expression. The work intentionally shifts between cultures and materials to foreground the value of embodied knowledge and rhythm. Questioning how far movement can transcend societal limitations or boundaries, this film dives into the intersections between desire, performativity and permission — a vital element in any ritualistic or religious possession.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your body is fragranced","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krystle Patel","original_name":"Krystle Patel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669bd13e428a1d990777733e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
