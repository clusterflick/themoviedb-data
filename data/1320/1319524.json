His tent, a \"place of refuge,\" anchors tradition amid rising youth violence challenging state and tribal authority. As societal desperation and poverty intensify, Farhan faces a profound struggle: the State of Israel demands the uprooting of his tribe from its home of 71 years. Amid frantic reconciliation efforts between tribes, this poignant tale unfolds-a clash between ancient traditions and modern mandates. Farhan fights to preserve his community's legacy, navigating a delicate balance between the timeless laws of the desert and the new world.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/5NLScOis575sz0KKwSdGgyZ7JYL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tree M
