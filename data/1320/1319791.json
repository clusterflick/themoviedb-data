The programme is richly woven with news archive from the 1970s, showing protests about land rights and the Treaty of Waitangi, and a campaign for te reo to be taught in schools. Several ex Ngā Tamatoa members — including Hone Harawira, Tame Iti and Larry Parr— are interviewed by Paratene, who also presents the documentary.","popularity":0.8494,"poster_path":"/zqDi0A8dIX9XuaQzz4OhxarpDQm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":234513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tūmanako
