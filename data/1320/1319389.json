Our new film highlights “Old Survivor”, the only remaining old-growth redwood in the East Bay hills, and tells the story of Oakland’s resilient, ecologically amazing, and now protected redwood forest.  Featuring Save the Redwoods League, City of Oakland Parks, and the East Bay Regional Park District, the film promotes outdoor recreation and open space networks, encourages stewardship, celebrates local history, and educates the viewer about redwood forest ecology.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Survivor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11142074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Old Survivor Trailer","key":"287739206","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-08-31T22:24:41.000Z","id":"669c73a8ffec41ea134baf41"}]}}}
