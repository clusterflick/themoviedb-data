Fragments of a Ritual Prayer","overview":"\"Both Breath and Clay. Fragments of a Ritual Prayer\" explores the mythological motif of the night-sea journey.  This short experimental film delves into the poetic threads of our liminal bodies, celebrating rhizomatic existence, and meeting the wound's space as a ritual of prayer in an ongoing state of becoming.  By capturing image physicality and texture through the lens of Digital Cameras, MiniDV, and the recording of screens and projected images, the film immerses viewers in a dreamlike sensory journey intertwined with the lyrical and spoken word of poetry.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Both Breath and Clay.
