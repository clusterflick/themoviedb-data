This is Loudness' heaviest live recording and focuses mostly on the potent doom and heavy metal release \"Terror\" since seven songs are played from that record, including the first six tunes of the show that develop a truly hypnotizing heaviness. The other songs consist of a few tracks from more recent albums recorded since the reunion and four classics from the eighties.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/x9ysPGGdZ54TcIlw6opc0J0QxKF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loudness - Live Terror 2004","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x9ysPGGdZ54TcIlw6opc0J0QxKF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
