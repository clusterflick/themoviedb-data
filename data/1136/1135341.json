Others believe the Constitution was crafted in broad, open-ended language and that its meaning evolves over time. The film argues that the far right is using originalism as a cover to advance a radically conservative political agenda: overturning laws that protect civil rights, voting rights, affirmative action, reproductive rights, privacy, and sexual freedom. Interviewees include Robert Bork, Alan Dershowitz, Edwin Meese, Senator Alan Simpson, and leading scholars.","popularity":0.1576,"poster_path":"/6hyULBoHp95PZ12IKhSMrnP0yLe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Original Intent: The Battle for America","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Medeiros","original_name":"Michael Medeiros","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":"/27epwRlFDo6ODCwXb1Lvqf8ZrS1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"647a3972caef2d00df87f992","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":52311,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthony Sherin","original_name":"Anthony Sherin","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647a395c17497300de65c83e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1479324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1354,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6hyULBoHp95PZ12IKhSMrnP0yLe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":903}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Newport Beach Int'l Film Festival","release_date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Newburyport Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2007-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
