The associations of industrial alienation coexist with the intimacy of the personal object and the proximity of the camera. In another cinematic analogue the music box suggests a kind of Wellesian Rosebud significance that is never resolved. The literary allusion would be Proust’s Madeleine Cake - the intense gaze inside the box leads not to traces of Dahlberg’s own history but instead to associative moments in the history of industrialism and cinema.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/l2gMwewj2Lz3AnDLEcRjiknTviT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Box","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Dahlberg","original_name":"Jonas Dahlberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6479f0460e29a20116ac1ecc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":2067,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l2gMwewj2Lz3AnDLEcRjiknTviT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1542},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eUCeVOM4RVylMwCFPVd4E1ER9sz.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
