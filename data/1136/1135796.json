Participants discussed the contemporary role of Brecht, nationally and internationally; Brecht’s directorial methods; the collaboration between director and actor; and the theater ensemble’s role in society. Actress and Berliner Ensemble director Helene Weigel gave the final keynote, emphasizing the political role of theater.  This short film features scenes from Brecht’s model staging of Mr. Puntila and His Man Matti, played by students at the Schauspielschule Berlin, from the Berliner Ensemble staging of Coriolanus; and from The Exception and the Rule, played by Berlin-based Arab lay actors under the direction of Syrian director Chérif Khaznadar.","popularity":0.1112,"poster_path":"/1mAPh20fbVyMA6bJjL8Lv5NkCB2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brecht Dialog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2066487,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Inge Dochow","original_name":"Inge Dochow","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647be72bcf4b8b00c3d2685f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1749026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karlheinz Mund","original_name":"Karlheinz Mund","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647be72193828e00dcdcf00a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814921,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bärbel Hoffmann","original_name":"Bärbel Hoffmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647be73e93828e00dcdcf03c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621513,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Lehmann","original_name":"Christian Lehmann","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647be758cf4b8b01031e800e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1mAPh20fbVyMA6bJjL8Lv5NkCB2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1968-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
