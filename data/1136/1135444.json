During the day, the SAS were used as treatment centres and at night as torture centres, in order to crush the Algerian resistance. The SAS were inhabited by French soldiers and auxiliaries (harkis, goumiers) and their families.  At independence in 1962, a few families of auxiliaries stayed on; the vacant buildings were occupied by families of martyrs awaiting the better days promised by the new Algeria. 46 years later, the SAS at Laperrine, in the Bouira region, still exists, a unique place inhabited by people who have taken refuge there. They have been joined by farmers fleeing the terrorism of the 90s. They all live as best they can in a place they did not choose, suffering the consequences of war.","popularity":0.2092,"poster_path":"/raJr0bzjWl0RGDigYKxtYiRNz01.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201384,"logo_path":null,"name":"TRIBU documenatries","origin_country":""},{"id":13592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Play Film","origin_country":""},{"id":17321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Images Plus","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201386,"logo_path":"/2JBLw1gNfZfDPR1hrve3DLkBoBc.png","name":"Cirta Films","origin_country":"DZ"},{"id":11545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre Régional des Ressources Audiovisuelles (CRRAV)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Li Fet Met (Le passé est mort)","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehmet Arikan","original_name":"Mehmet Arikan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647a7e28caef2d0119bf1d37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Bouferkas","original_name":"Nadia Bouferkas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcac7e7041d60f33d05a22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehmet Arikan","original_name":"Mehmet Arikan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcac8d6329d032d8d05b40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Bouferkas","original_name":"Nadia Bouferkas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcac96df2aba95b3f22e36","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehmet Arikan","original_name":"Mehmet Arikan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcac9f25b61c33da5943ad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Bouferkas","original_name":"Nadia Bouferkas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcacac25b61c33da5943b1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4975100,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mehmet Afrikan","original_name":"Mehmet Afrikan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcacba6329d032d8d05b4b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Carrière","original_name":"Christine Carrière","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcacc4348de1fabff22ecf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/13LIwj1n7rbwkWyDHooLEQXqoxt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/raJr0bzjWl0RGDigYKxtYiRNz01.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yZddOi1PaNQCE1xCPwlVpzF0JJd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":298300,"name":"harkis"},{"id":327731,"name":"algerian society"},{"id":339098,"name":"fellaga"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
