In the Jungian sense, abstraction’s purpose is to break the object’s hold on the subject, thus freeing the content from old meanings. When this separation occurs, as it does in Dahlberg’s work, the space for new meanings opens up.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ewpVESo2S9nJyWF66mk1mfNt8sT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One-way Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Dahlberg","original_name":"Jonas Dahlberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6479eccb174973013500b56b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":1903,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ewpVESo2S9nJyWF66mk1mfNt8sT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1441},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWd1UQdCwRmTjOCGytMyfUN3wkU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ubTBQ4DRk3XADu0oP7mhhKof7NO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
