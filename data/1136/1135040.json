This famous mountaineer has made more than twenty-one ascents on mountains of 8,000 m altitude, without using supplemental oxygen, and has reached the summit of Everest four times. In 1996 he saved the lives of many climbers in a group led by Scott Fischer during their attempt on Everest. The documentary is based on footage shot during his tragic last ascent of Annapurna in Nepal in 1997.","popularity":0.4127,"poster_path":"/f1S01XvKBCdELrnw492XYF5D1l7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unconquerable Summit","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Unconquered Peak","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4037956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoli Boukreev","original_name":"Anatoli Boukreev","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/c6pG6N9UikMnSS7vd5USELXuSzR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6479572ecf4b8b00c3d144ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Moro","original_name":"Simone Moro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/riPyDR7jLeftw3SbfG4s4ywoIPw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6479573ccf4b8b00c3d144f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4037952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitri Sobolev","original_name":"Dimitri Sobolev","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/yHephmUN8CNAJrRYCFMtUxBlJz3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647957470e29a200bf1dee7c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Tyulkin","original_name":"Vladimir Tyulkin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gClsAZbm22lPvs7WVuaBFJO37m2.jpg","credit_id":"647a1cff93828e011623cf11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27925305","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6fZwPDPZI8mEHHSsfZS1UBsg02L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2uJ1WLUa9wgiM6G8bQ1C1Bx7NZ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cQSW5Ww6bq6ebvm8twOI0rqeFPZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aksdaIqsbCR3EF593Tk86rKfRUS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j5W9MtTox7TuPNykjlMGnxIrcF1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f1S01XvKBCdELrnw492XYF5D1l7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":217123,"name":"mountain rescue"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":302661,"name":"annapurna"},{"id":307583,"name":"goat climber"},{"id":318673,"name":"anatoli bookreev"},{"id":318674,"name":"mountain hero"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
