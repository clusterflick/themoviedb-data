The drama's undulations are expressed early on in the prologue to tango music which was en vogue at the time.  After its debut in 1984 with Takashio Tomoe and Wakaba Hiromi, this exquisite drama was repeatedly restaged. This time, it will be revived as the debut performance for the new Top Combi of Snow Troupe, Nozomi Fuuto and Maaya Kiho.","popularity":0.2021,"poster_path":"/qNEwdxcPV8OXkIleEnwk03iWxtE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue
