The camera follows the halls inside the building and reveals the secrets hiding in its walls. It takes us to places behind the curtains, inaccessible for the audience on a regular day, and stumbles upon the people of the theatre, both real and legendary. The spirit of the theatre becomes alive on the screen.","popularity":0.0926,"poster_path":"/xSgtLTUUKaYZMTsTtYu1LxeHanb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Narodowy Stary Teatr im.
