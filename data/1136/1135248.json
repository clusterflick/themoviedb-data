The story of Windrush has come into painfully sharp focus in recent years but what is less well-known is the story of the children of these pioneers whose parents left to rebuild Britain and they only knew of through the ‘barrel' care packages sent back.  These are the children’s stories of reconciliation and rediscovery within a new world that made little sense to them.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":201348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brixton Heights","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barrel Children: The Families Windrush Left Behind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blacker Dread","original_name":"Blacker Dread","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6479fe910e29a20133c2ebee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evadney Campbell","original_name":"Evadney Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6479fe9e93828e011623c420","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Kenlock","original_name":"Neil Kenlock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6479feab17497300fb3a2d38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burchell Davidson","original_name":"Burchell Davidson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6479feb817497300a818b114","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merlyn Rhone","original_name":"Merlyn Rhone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6479fec3e323f3014815faa0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Pringle","original_name":"Jennifer Pringle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6479fed093828e00bf9db981","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Arnold","original_name":"Elaine Arnold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6479fee7caef2d00fce4ffee","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadine White","original_name":"Nadine White","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6479fe74cf4b8b01418e7709","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Picturehouse Docs","release_date":"2023-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Barrel Children: The Families Windrush Left Behind documentary trailer","key":"9ep_uUNYnPE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-06-22T13:30:01.000Z","id":"647a00a0cf4b8b00e2d52112"}]}}}
