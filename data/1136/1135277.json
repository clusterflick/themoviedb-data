As he lay handcuffed and shackled, Pendleton Correctional Facility guards beat the prisoner beyond recognition as terrified bystanders watched from their cells. But Lokmar’s story ended differently, when 2 fellow prisoners sacrificed their freedom to save him from his assailants — a KKK-affiliated guard gang known as the Sons of Light. The Pendleton 2: They Stood Up tells the story of John “Balagoon” Cole and Christopher “Naeem” Trotter, the leaders of the Indiana prison uprising that rescued Lokmar, exposed Pendleton’s dehumanizing conditions, and unleashed the vindictive wrath of the Indiana Department of Correction.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/vF7Yb0fJwzW8GmCCSBJDsRBVE8I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pendleton 2: They Stood Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"TheKingTrill","original_name":"TheKingTrill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"647b41fc0e29a200dcbae637","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John \"Balagoon\" Cole","original_name":"John \"Balagoon\" Cole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"647b421f0e29a20133c38d5b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher \"Naeem\" Trotter","original_name":"Christopher \"Naeem\" Trotter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"647b42360e29a200f981c65c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Too Black","original_name":"Too Black","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b4129e323f300e52479cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Too Black","original_name":"Too Black","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b410ccf4b8b00a8778bbd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095236,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clint Breeze","original_name":"Clint Breeze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b417917497301350153a0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095235,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jorel Jebre","original_name":"Jorel Jebre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b416ccaef2d00df8881fb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"TheKingTrill","original_name":"TheKingTrill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b40c30e29a200dcbae5be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"TheKingTrill","original_name":"TheKingTrill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b40fe17497300fb3acf38","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Too Black","original_name":"Too Black","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b40d10e29a200f981c5da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4095230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"TheKingTrill","original_name":"TheKingTrill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647b41840e29a200a6605697","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1855,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vF7Yb0fJwzW8GmCCSBJDsRBVE8I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1237}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
