Mehta is known for his evocative Prabhatiyan (morning hymns) and especially for his composition Vaishnava jana to ('The Vaishnav is he who knows the pain of others') made popular by Gandhi, who also adapted the poet's term Harijan (children of god) for the nation's Untouchables. The film adheres to the Gandhian interpretation of Narasinh Mehta's work, avoiding e.g. miracle scenes.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/tNYU07xc6LrKgAOXSFytJ1eUiio.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sagar Movietone","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1932-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Gujarati","iso_639_1":"gu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narasinh Mehta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2407783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohanlala","original_name":"Mohanlala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ra Mandlik","credit_id":"6479a790cf4b8b01418e51ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maruti Rao","original_name":"Maruti Rao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6479a7a40e29a200bf1e16a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Master Manhar","original_name":"Master Manhar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narasinh Mehta","credit_id":"6479a7ae17497300a8188bc3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Master Bachhu","original_name":"Master Bachhu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kunwarbai's Husband","credit_id":"6479a7b70e29a20116abfeae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umakant Desai","original_name":"Umakant Desai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Krishna","credit_id":"6479a7c393828e011623a08d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trikam Das","original_name":"Trikam Das","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6479a7d3caef2d01362a4902","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miss Jamna","original_name":"Miss Jamna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Manekbai","credit_id":"6479a7dfe323f3014815d53c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miss Mehtab","original_name":"Miss Mehtab","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6479a7ed0e29a200dcba1ff2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miss Mehtun","original_name":"Miss Mehtun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Rakmini","credit_id":"6479a7f6e323f3012750ddd6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khatun","original_name":"Khatun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kunwaibai","credit_id":"6479a8010e29a200a65f8f5f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miss Devi","original_name":"Miss Devi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6479a80e93828e00bf9d961b","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nanubhai Vakil","original_name":"Nanubhai Vakil","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6479a81a17497300c1319988","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093028,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chaturbhuj Doshi","original_name":"Chaturbhuj Doshi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6479a8240e29a20116abfee7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259456","wikidata_id":"Q19573231","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tNYU07xc6LrKgAOXSFytJ1eUiio.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"1932-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
