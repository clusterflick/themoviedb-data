July the 15th. Stage 17 of the Tour de France. A brutal stage from Luchon to Mourenx covering four of the toughest mountains in the Pyrenees. On this fateful day, Eddy Merckx catapulted himself into the history books with one of the greatest solo breakaways the sport has ever seen.  Fast forward over half a century, and GCNâ€™s Simon Richardson is in the Pyrenees to pay tribute to The Cannibal by recreating his ride. To make the 220km epic even more challenging, Si will do it aboard his 1969 spec Faema team bike and wearing their iconic red and white jersey.  Eddy Merckx made this ride look easy, but will Si even make it to the finish line?","popularity":0.339,"poster_path":"/bKrbQcaTjAQBGraub5gRjqyVKCQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1969 -
