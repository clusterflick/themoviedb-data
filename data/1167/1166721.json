This was made when there were rumours of a remake coming around the corner (mainly by Britain's Hammer Films).  Also, there were plans to re-release that during the film's 1972 re-release (in all its uncut glory), the color scene popped up.  This ended up on Cascade's demo reel and in 1974, it winded up on the Volkswagen commercial (which ran for a short period time for a few reasons.  One of them was that people thought that the car was too big and the other was that the ape scared the daughter of the head of Volkswagen). David Allen would create and animate Kong again for the Imax film Special Effects: Anything Can Happen (1996).","popularity":0.0735,"poster_path":"/qRpmT5W5HH0xE9o79aqTA6VLxlK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cascade Pictures of California","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Kong Color Test Footage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":187067,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"David Allen","original_name":"David Allen","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":"/vKwH2A1HUwR2EGHzRauUBg2YKWm.jpg","credit_id":"64dfa4fcb77d4b11425fb629","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":187067,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"David Allen","original_name":"David Allen","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":"/vKwH2A1HUwR2EGHzRauUBg2YKWm.jpg","credit_id":"64dfa50fa3b5e60139016c51","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qRpmT5W5HH0xE9o79aqTA6VLxlK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stop-Motion Rarities: \"King Kong Color Test Footage\" by David Allen (1971).","key":"mzJGw8OdIag","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-02T17:23:34.000Z","id":"654fd9c9d4653700ab95dadc"}]}}}
