Today, he works as a substitute teacher, with the dream of stability in which he himself believes little. Graziano is an outgoing but debt-ridden merchant, an opportunist, and a bit of a liar. Despite this, Graziano also loves music and wants to open a venue and pursue art to escape a life filled with schemes and small deceptions. These two men are very different but also very similar, with no particular hopes and little faith in the future. They have been grayed by the blows of life but possess a certain disenchanted irony and the need, more than the desire, to believe in a change. Their lives intersect, and it's an opportunity for both to try to realize that dream together or simply to build a friendship.","popularity":0.2968,"poster_path":"/cvNdPYoyosSQGT1LuEzozESNsBW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Itaca
