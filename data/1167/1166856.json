The family of his wife took Ajlin to Novi Pazar, Serbia, and he never saw her again in her baby bed in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite his efforts to fight for his rights, the other side of the family initiated a trial process against him, claiming he was not fit to care for a child. The father made countless trips to Novi Pazar, hoping to reunite with his daughter, but to no avail. In a particularly distressing incident, Ajlin was schooled to fear her father, who was painted as a monster who would harm her. The documentary highlights the father’s resilience and determination to be reunited with his daughter, while also shedding light on the legal and cultural challenges that stand in his way.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/dKG7tonXw0z7yJKjiFuwJeo4t7A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2023-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Ajlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4222667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esma Sarić","original_name":"Esma Sarić","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e02a18371097011c53c8d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2744132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dženan Esko","original_name":"Dženan Esko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e789ec594c9400ffe5937d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600214,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fadil Komarica","original_name":"Fadil Komarica","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e789e090ea4b00e49d2fa9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2825919,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Muhamed Bajramović","original_name":"Muhamed Bajramović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e788d2c613ce012cc4a23a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2281932,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Melina Alagić","original_name":"Melina Alagić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e788b7c613ce014dfb8873","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3180556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tarik Bićo","original_name":"Tarik Bićo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e7893c06f984014e67decb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2744132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dženan Esko","original_name":"Dženan Esko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e788be1feac100c46dc321","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKG7tonXw0z7yJKjiFuwJeo4t7A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bs","note":"Sarajevo Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
