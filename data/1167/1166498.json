As the U.S. expands westward, encroaching on Native lands, tensions surge, leading to the strategic establishment of the Bozeman Trail through Sioux territory. However, the promise of peace shatters with the U.S.'s relentless intrusion into the sacred Black Hills. The narrative takes a poignant turn when the Ghost Dance religion emerges, a spiritual outcry born from despair and a yearning to reclaim a lost world. Through intense dialogues and reflections, the film challenges viewers to confront the moral complexities of war and ponder the cost of progress. As modernity dawns, the shared pain of Wounded Knee remains an indelible scar, urging societies to remember, reconcile, and respect.","popularity":0.289,"poster_path":"/lou0WXS1VcLiBYmAlAmyqxN1EOx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the shadow of American expansion, the fierce resistance of Chief Red Cloud and the haunting echoes of the Wounded Knee Massacre challenge a nation to confront the price of progress and the moral complexities of war.","title":"The Sioux: From Red Cloud to Wounded Knee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3736471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Keith Collins","original_name":"Robert Keith Collins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Robert Keith Collins","credit_id":"64ded26fa3b5e600c5bcdbf8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
