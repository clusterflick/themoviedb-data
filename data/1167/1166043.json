Emotions are imbued on the object, one that is already a symbol of strength, desire and freedom. Throughout the film, the motorcycle evolves from an object of transportation to one of transformation, a mode of navigating gender and sexuality upon leaving religion. The film reckons with difficult memories, the effect of religion on the body in the present and the grief of what is left behind as it looks towards the future.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aiming at the Apocalypse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4219517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shireen McCormack","original_name":"Shireen McCormack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd7cc8b77d4b114347b2b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4219519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saati J Conran-McCormack","original_name":"Saati J Conran-McCormack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd7cdc59e8a900fffee33c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
