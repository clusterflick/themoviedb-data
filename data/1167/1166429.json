His older sister, Jessa protects Jary through his early years, then takes him in as a young teen, to raise him alongside her own two children in a fragile house on a hill. Jessa seeks out the medical care Jary has been denied since birth. And more, the support to begin his physical and emotional recovery.  Every Day After is a 35-minute documentary film that provides a more nuanced look at the complexities of the healing process we donâ€™t often see. And honors the invisible labor of a sister whose love and action make it possible for Jary to experience the everyday joys and struggles of growing up.","popularity":0.8992,"poster_path":"/AsUamUjcfweusZOZs37DUBgRzd2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143150,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Production Place","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Day After","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neal Broffman","original_name":"Neal Broffman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64de82ede19de9011d5d6086","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miranda Kahn","original_name":"Miranda Kahn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64de839259e8a9011c8c2868","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Woody Woodhall","original_name":"Woody Woodhall","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64de887537109700ffb93b14","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4220746,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elaine Jose Bobadilla","original_name":"Elaine Jose Bobadilla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64de8340d100b614b5f7a145","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neal Broffman","original_name":"Neal Broffman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64de83005ab81a01391972c7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4220745,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dave A.
