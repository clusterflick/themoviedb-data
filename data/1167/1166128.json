Since 21 April 2020, the government has imposed strict lockdown measures upon all dormitories, and the migrant workers—mostly hailing from South Asia or China—have been largely confined to their rooms. It is in this context that Ripon Chowdhury was invited by artist Ho Tzu Nyen to contribute to Contactless Deliveries. A poet, writer, and activist from Chittagong, Bangladesh, Chowdhury has been based in Singapore since 2010 as a migrant worker.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Waiting (Ripon Chowdhury with Ho Tzu Nyen), 2020","title":"Waiting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho Tzu Nyen","original_name":"Ho Tzu Nyen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ddc541d100b614b4ccb184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4219762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ripon Chowdhury","original_name":"Ripon Chowdhury","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ddc567aaec7103f996bde2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
