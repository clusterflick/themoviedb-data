His deputy, Mladen, has committed suicide after massive public protests and inter-union clashes. Zeljko is torn between the guilt he feels over Mladen’s death and workers’ expectations that he will lead a strike that should thwart a plan by the government, acting on the EU’s behest, to declare the factory bankrupt. WHAT’S TO BE DONE? is structured in three acts. The first act uses observational documentary footage; the second, footage filmed a decade later; while the third is fiction.","popularity":0.1052,"poster_path":"/XkGrYuCsnvuqVUfraDWqbdHodw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petnaesta Umjetnost","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2023-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's to Be Done?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192961,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Goran Dević","original_name":"Goran Dević","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/gOcCjgIIA6QiJQegmui4CceQZ0A.jpg","credit_id":"64debd9fa3b5e6013900f5cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192961,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Goran Dević","original_name":"Goran Dević","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/gOcCjgIIA6QiJQegmui4CceQZ0A.jpg","credit_id":"64debda6d100b614b15a65f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179557,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Iva Kraljević","original_name":"Iva Kraljević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64debde8b77d4b113fc6127b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4220973,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hrvoje Osvadić","original_name":"Hrvoje Osvadić","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64debdfaaaec7103f7e31bb2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damian Nenadić","original_name":"Damian Nenadić","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64debe0ee19de900c68aba9f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039705,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Semenčić","original_name":"Martin Semenčić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64debe2baaec7103fbea6cb4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039706,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Zelić","original_name":"Ivan Zelić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64debe385ab81a00c5b680d5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22334548","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/XkGrYuCsnvuqVUfraDWqbdHodw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":629}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hr","note":"Sarajevo Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
