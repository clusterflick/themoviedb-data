A well-respected professor, he resigned his position at the university a few years ago over his support for the student protesters. Now living quietly in Khao Yai, a small town three hours outside of Bangkok, his life is turned upside down when his best friend Ong comes to visit. Beat finds himself drawn back in to the teenage hijinks that always unfolds when the two of them are together. As the weekend spirals into a drunken ruin, leaving a trail of hurt feelings and broken hearts for everyone involved, Beat is forced to reevaluate his life and the principles he has always tried to live by. Ong however, doesn’t share his best friend’s disappointment. He tells Beat that he cannot just withdraw from life. He has no choice but to live it, mistakes and all.","popularity":0.0697,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76586,"logo_path":"/8IToSMttTBtO40fWsxSd1HES4cS.png","name":"Akanga Film Asia","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Thonglor Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545683,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fran Borgia","original_name":"Fran Borgia","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64df8979a3b5e600ff4e1228","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aditya Assarat","original_name":"Aditya Assarat","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/m3MsoKDpYXX1KCvATOsvpu2Nozx.jpg","credit_id":"64df8946aaec7103fa48123a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aditya Assarat","original_name":"Aditya Assarat","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/m3MsoKDpYXX1KCvATOsvpu2Nozx.jpg","credit_id":"64df894bb77d4b113fc67870","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28437560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
