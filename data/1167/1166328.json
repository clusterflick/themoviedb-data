For decades, the filmmaker (who, like Lambert, was born in 1944 and has also lived her entire life in Berlin) was Lambert's closest collaborator both in front of and behind the camera. Inevitably, this creates a self-portrait of the director and her film work, which she ended with this work.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kuck mal, wer da filmt!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagmar Beiersdorf","original_name":"Dagmar Beiersdorf","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64de3f88b77d4b113e064e01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
