A mise-en-abyme, a reflection on reflections, in other words, an endless looking, or relooking. The mirror (phase) offers a time without end, a glassy eye that throws back the world as an endless picture. It invites its subject to become a picture as well. The mirror is already part of a loop, a cycle of seeing and seen. Though of course the mirror is the hidden watcher, it watches its watchers, endlessly. As Derrida says: The force of the image has to do less with the fact that one sees something in it than with the fact that one is seen... The image sees more than it is seen.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/8yVSsJUa3XSVjZytUnXXfgUcxG8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"64de0094b77d4b114019a846","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8yVSsJUa3XSVjZytUnXXfgUcxG8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2015-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
