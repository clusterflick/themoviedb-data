He became the fastest person to cycle 100,000 miles in just 500 days. After this epic feat of endurance, Tommy had to learn to walk again and uncurl his hands! The madcap record has only been attempted by a handful of determined souls and Tommy’s record stood for 76 years making it one of the greatest, but also most overlooked sporting achievements. Ultra endurance athlete and round the world cycling record holder Mark Beaumont is on a mission to shine a light on Tommy’s ride. He delves deeper into Tommy’s story and finds out if he has the physical and mental stamina to take on Godwin’s record.","popularity":0.3883,"poster_path":"/lF3M0hnls0tiYTptJe8RAGT6nOw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
