Clashing lines create new possibilities for redefinition. This short silent film employs digital green screen to create fleshy layers seeping underneath and being revealed, and other sets of imagery coming through. The lines that you can see were made in the physical world using marker pens and paper. The resulting line drawings were then documented and filmed where the camera moved across the drawn paper. Now existing digitally, the drawings were then layered over one another and green screen processes were applied to create arresting tensions between the lines. The marks without sound makes you stop from thinking about the moment it was drawn and now put into a different space the viewer concentrates on the layers â€“ all these tensions in the lines being made.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Your Marks: Tension Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2753144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Campbell","original_name":"Lee Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ddb0715ab81a00c5b60d1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
