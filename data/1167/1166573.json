His violent father, repressed mother and the wear and tear of everyday life have made him aloof and apathetic. After finishing work, Mitsos goes out for one last deal but a last minute stop by his parents' place turns him into the witness of a fateful event. A backpack, an elevator that gets stuck and the kitsch painting of a mountain mark the turning point that reminds him, right before fate takes over, that not making a choice, is itself a choice.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jrR2rSofATfU9SwyA9EFYcVPiYK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Epikindynoi polites","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Επικίνδυνοι πολίτες","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgos Fasoulas","original_name":"Giorgos Fasoulas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dealer","credit_id":"64df1bf15ab81a00ad2080af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Filippidis","original_name":"Dimitris Filippidis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mitsos","credit_id":"64df1c01b77d4b11425f82ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tasos Giannopoulos","original_name":"Tasos Giannopoulos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Antonis","credit_id":"64df1c41aaec7103fcfd7817","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thodora Katsifi","original_name":"Thodora Katsifi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"64df1c515ab81a013919c849","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Half Quickie","original_name":"Half Quickie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Delivery Boy","credit_id":"64df1c5fb77d4b1143487b37","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4221279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denia Stasinopoulou","original_name":"Ντένια Στασινοπούλου","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/k0di0SEEDfv91UMiWXu8nrjM040.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aliki","credit_id":"64df1c69aaec7103fcfd7835","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221283,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"DJ the Boy","original_name":"DJ the Boy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64df1d5937109700ffb98e29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3986055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Gambino","original_name":"Dani Gambino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64df205d5ab81a00ad208334","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3986055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Gambino","original_name":"Dani Gambino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64df1d79aaec7103f7e3553f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Giotis","original_name":"Dimitris Giotis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64df1d16aaec7103f7e35512","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Giotis","original_name":"Dimitris Giotis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64df1d01d100b614b0a58101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":841,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jrR2rSofATfU9SwyA9EFYcVPiYK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
