In 2013, a young man in Florida was literally \"swallowed up by the earth\" when a cesspool suddenly opened up under his bedroom. The film's main setting is a bedroom by night. From the way it was shot, the viewer has the feeling of peering into an abandoned life-size dollhouse. Other sequences show close-up views of a young man lying on a bed with a tormented look on his face or cowering in a corner. The scene is accompanied by an exaggeratedly romantic song whose refrain – \"It took me so long to get my feet back off the ground\" – alludes to the loss of a loved one and a sense of abysmal loneliness. The song's emotionality contrasts starkly with the artificiality of the scene. The boundary between reproduction and reality grows fluid, and the virtuality – which the artist has carried to a near- perfect extreme – begins to crumble in view of the protagonist's physical and emotional frailty.","popularity":0.3361,"poster_path":"/dWA6nnm83205zyHeOpyi5JOSACX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hisser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Atkins","original_name":"Ed Atkins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yaFe7uQGwGBNJEVNtdtHdBn6oyf.jpg","credit_id":"665b888a3e8ec2dadfd5b462","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dWA6nnm83205zyHeOpyi5JOSACX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":894,"name":"depression"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":278823,"name":"3d animation"},{"id":307787,"name":"cgi effects"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"14.İstanbul Bienali – Ed Atkins ''Hisser''","key":"_RkHCnfqdh8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-24T12:36:54.000Z","id":"665b8915a13676449c0724e8"}]}}}
