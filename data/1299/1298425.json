These are not stories of victims or people to feel sorry for, rather it's a story of some of the strongest people you have never met. 26% of the people in America today are disabled. Some are born that way, some come across it in different ways. In 1990 the ADA was passed giving hope to future generations of disabled Americans. 30 years later, we still have buildings that are inaccessible to disabled students. There is conflict in the way some of us have had to fight for basic needs that never got met.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"26%","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4747625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daria Chirhart","original_name":"Daria Chirhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"665a50536a481f393eaef1ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4747626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Neubert","original_name":"Josh Neubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"665a50597e1739f87c47ae00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4747627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meli Werner","original_name":"Meli Werner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"665a505d7f058514a7100ee3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4747627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meli Werner","original_name":"Meli Werner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665a50670c430567e1b69580","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4747627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meli Werner","original_name":"Meli Werner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665a506d82bf42d7ecaef1fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4643914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Rogers","original_name":"Andrew Rogers","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665a50cfadc4bf266659027e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4747627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meli Werner","original_name":"Meli Werner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665a50e54332dc6ebe33073d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4747638,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrea Rogers","original_name":"Andrea Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665a5107c949fdae12f43786","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
