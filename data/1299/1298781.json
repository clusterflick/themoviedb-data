One is brought to a secluded rock quarry where a chemical spill has poisoned the pond waters and the other is left for dead in a local \"haunted forest\" where ghostly whispers of evil have been rumoured for decades. Can these misguided teenage miscreants survive to see their junior year of high school begin on Monday? Or will they fall prey to the vengeful supernatural forces they've somehow awoken? It's anyone's guess in this coming of age tale of betrayal, murder, retribution and most of all horror- Straight out of the late '80s from \"America's Dairyland\". The lost SOV film from the Fox Valley gets it's most frightening revival, rescued from out of VHS
