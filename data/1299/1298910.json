With his broken heart he musters all his strength and tries to jump one more time just to be stopped by Gulshan. Gulshan, with his master technique, runs an assisted suicide business of pushing people down the cliff for a one time price of 10,000 INR, including GST. Pavitr declines the offer until Gulshan shares the success rate of the jumps from the cliff, 82% never see the daylight again and the poor 18% keep regretting why they didnt say 'yes' to Gulshan as they sit in their wheelchair. Will Pavitr pay to not be in the 18%?","popularity":0.0566,"poster_path":"/kPcsHcTNE9LCRBPvY8s0eGMp6Px.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2100 Ft","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naseeruddin Shah","original_name":"Naseeruddin Shah","popularity":0.8801,"profile_path":"/lFvGfKypi5NNyUjrsT8Y7ebWc7G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gulshan","credit_id":"665c04a78f8420c7c6fe0956","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4227317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naveen Jagbir Sandhu","original_name":"Naveen Jagbir Sandhu","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/j8jYNIco8fVOQInYqR3SLay0X2I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"665c04c4599673deb35b7c0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4749896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neeltarni Pratap","original_name":"Neeltarni Pratap","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Urma","credit_id":"665c04e88d79306483e7a747","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krishan Hooda","original_name":"Krishan Hooda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665c05792dad417afda62a0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15422716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kPcsHcTNE9LCRBPvY8s0eGMp6Px.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
