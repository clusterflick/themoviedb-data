This has led them to an existence full of uneasiness that sinks them deeper and deeper into total and soporific tedium. They both frequent a place called The Chicago Club, where sordidness invades the atmosphere and time stands still. Anton, an evil man, collaborates with Augusto and Santino and helps them to fulfill the fantasies that both wish to carry out night after night: «to achieve absolute power», and «to remember past loves», among other delusions. One night, the stakes between Antón, Santino, and Augusto grow along with the game they take to the limit. The characters get lost in their delusions, the insults become real, as well as the pain, the anguish, the hate, and their obsessions, all this in a single night where tragedy inhabits it: the excitement touches the bottom and death appears, it becomes an ally of power.","popularity":0.0608,"poster_path":"/8M3ut0YXAzIGUWxm3dRK7BsFMSu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ad Absurdum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"Deshonra","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Banda","original_name":"Fernando Banda","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"665d5e58e85533e83bdd87f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Luis Moreno","original_name":"Jorge Luis Moreno","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/9FPA3fZ28c31H9Y7BU59w5P8bO4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"665d5e785bb58a224ecc77de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Humberto Solórzano","original_name":"Humberto Solórzano","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/AryxOeRnzziOCaYylpZUpy9ockd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"665d5e8c6a6c940cd6907d40","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Alfredo Hinojosa","original_name":"Hugo Alfredo Hinojosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665d5e1f5bb58a224ecc77d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Alfredo Hinojosa","original_name":"Hugo Alfredo Hinojosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665d5e34a07c5e5d486fbb3f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Alfredo Hinojosa","original_name":"Hugo Alfredo Hinojosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713c71199f22f326aad17a6","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graciela Cázares","original_name":"Graciela Cázares","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713c930c6e304096195e494","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474444,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"José Luis Salazar","original_name":"José Luis Salazar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713c94a650248b9db621d84","department":"Crew","job":"Post-Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009768,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diego Alfredo Hinojosa","original_name":"Diego Alfredo Hinojosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713c97c99f22f326aad1894","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29375052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ui4G3lqdDtQvjmrDKL0nAIQbpXu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/neUUx9EaxcARBGcuRKsanOaNtRV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":896,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8M3ut0YXAzIGUWxm3dRK7BsFMSu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
