He eats bacon every day, watches 80’s films, and reads Bukowski on occasion. One fateful afternoon, he is convinced by his neighbor that something is wrong with him because he doesn’t do “what other people do.” He doesn’t run marathons, he doesn’t go to Broadway shows, and he doesn’t aspire to travel the world. His neighbor encourages him to talk to a doctor who puts him on treatment. The treatment takes him down a surreal path and suddenly the “new” Charlie finds himself in the middle of a potentially criminal New York art scene.","popularity":0.1141,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Philistine in Queens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Wincott","original_name":"Jeff Wincott","popularity":0.472,"profile_path":"/nTE993X30xB02W94yEKekEjTK9c.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Charlie Biggs","credit_id":"665a08a0dd28a2224e94247c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4531744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Wechsler","original_name":"Thomas Wechsler","popularity":0.1578,"profile_path":"/4KZ068AXMAwYEzibKVMZgymYTjg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Viggy","credit_id":"665a08c1dab77cca4e1d5e24","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28584045","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
