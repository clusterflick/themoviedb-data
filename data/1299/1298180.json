Alfredo is a man who has loved another man, Mario. He loved him so much that he found the courage to come out and lose his job and family. Mario, on the other hand, continued his married life, then became a father and finally a grandfather, because he is gay, but only part-time. Alfredo cannot bring himself to let him go, but neither can he live that relationship in the middle, so separation becomes inevitable here. At first, Alfredo convinces himself that he can escape the melancholy but then he accidentally slips on his partner's shirt and sees their whole life together again. Yes because all it takes is a scent, a smell to return there, where one was loved. Mario no longer wants to separate himself from that smell, which turns into an obsession, convinced that once it is gone, the last traces of their love will also disappear.","popularity":0.0742,"poster_path":"/ea6DoZaQkKh3qLhiWU7YLGyEX0o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2024-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 Minuti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Sette minuti","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3736219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierluigi Gigante","original_name":"Pierluigi Gigante","popularity":0.0624,"profile_path":"/c6mvWS9c9Ms4HWhd7pLZi0mKkn6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67ee9fdc54f595bb55a7c184","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Benedetta","original_name":"Mia Benedetta","popularity":0.1519,"profile_path":"/cXZyaWoBYWVAq40DdlBQsCEZZrh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67ee9ff815f6ba86f1e1a164","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Consuelo Ciatti","original_name":"Consuelo Ciatti","popularity":0.1658,"profile_path":"/3szHj8ostAW6RQ9CBIAedM75zhf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67eea00154f595bb55a7c1a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Batassa","original_name":"Lucia Batassa","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":"/uhpx9kk76B7Jo01v2uLUEPhELbr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67eea00c54f595bb55a7c1ac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Provenzano","original_name":"Enzo Provenzano","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/sMwJlMo8Y9I7kfhcoJOUHZm2cgY.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67eea01554f595bb55a7c1b0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5346834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Di Santo","original_name":"Mario Di Santo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"67eea0211d1ccf5f4f62b1a2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessia Bottone","original_name":"Alessia Bottone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ee9f8f54f595bb55a7c13a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessia Bottone","original_name":"Alessia Bottone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ee9f99cf06190cbae1b7ad","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025564,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fabrizio Franzini","original_name":"Fabrizio Franzini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ee9fa354f595bb55a7c13f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533724,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maria Pina Mastropietro","original_name":"Maria Pina Mastropietro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ee9fae54f595bb55a7c143","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2851030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mario Iaquone","original_name":"Mario Iaquone","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/8Mu8Lq0uqMFJXgOYpNF2391wdyz.jpg","credit_id":"67ee9fc615f6ba86f1e1a15a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raffaele Inno","original_name":"Raffaele Inno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ee9fcf1d1ccf5f4f62b177","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4602518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Costanza","original_name":"Francesco Costanza","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/b517g0vRm97FiKJwHWgspwuCHgw.jpg","credit_id":"67ee9fefcf06190cbae1b7c5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/ea6DoZaQkKh3qLhiWU7YLGyEX0o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
