Death, a shadowy specter, carrying his scythe, stalks into the castle, presenting a weird and awe-inspiring sight, and casts the plague upon all except a poor woman and her two little children, whose pleadings moved the king to take them along, and who, alone, prayed to be spared.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/ohPVf8W4QpFqKtB63L6M5KEjMpZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Societ√† Anonima Ambrosio","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1911-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mask of the Red Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgar Allan Poe","original_name":"Edgar Allan Poe","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/AlgddAgqBWRZUNHtX2Rue60HSIg.jpg","credit_id":"6659ca4571d53364d61d526e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174179,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arturo Ambrosio","original_name":"Arturo Ambrosio","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5a3e42074b0ee5600519a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174179,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arturo Ambrosio","original_name":"Arturo Ambrosio","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5a3ee5e8e5c9bacba5e2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1254287","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ohPVf8W4QpFqKtB63L6M5KEjMpZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1911-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
