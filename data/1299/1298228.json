It is also the feature-length debut of director Ishii Kaori. The process of making salt by collecting sea water and boiling it in a hiragama cauldron temporarily died out during the period of Japan's rapid economic growth following World War II, but one family's efforts to keep it alive has miraculously ensured its continuation. Salt is a vital element of people's lives. The saltmaking artisans who perpetuate their traditions represent a way forward for those of us living in this modern age.","popularity":0.2939,"poster_path":"/p6xxmTih1RUlS0sL6zRQmeyOl6l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hibana Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Handful of Salt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4746989,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaori Ishii","original_name":"石井かほり","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659f3a5cb6d59bd66a3f12e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4759581,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Misa Kimura","original_name":"Misa Kimura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66620bea8af87ba798477c47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127736,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ryu Segawa","original_name":"瀬川龍","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66620c1abb0049347421ffdd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4759584,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Koji Minowa","original_name":"Koji Minowa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66620c2927a13229b621ff6a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kensaku Tanikawa","original_name":"谷川賢作","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66620c3820be2102354f53a4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558197,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Yoshimi Hara","original_name":"Yoshimi Hara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66620c55284e0d3a05856e7d","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4759584,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Koji Minowa","original_name":"Koji Minowa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66620c6645940cbf457e7b11","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p6xxmTih1RUlS0sL6zRQmeyOl6l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1811}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":218890,"name":"salt"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ひとにぎりの塩 予告編","key":"zsrqVbe5_XA","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-08-08T07:48:23.000Z","id":"67fddb477c29ae5bc3d9855f"}]}}}
