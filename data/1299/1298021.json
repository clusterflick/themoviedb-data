I document. I write down my memories. I’m afraid they’ll disappear.\" This is how Victoria Verseau introduces her intimate documentary diary, in which she returns to Thailand and to the year 2012, when she underwent her transition. She had long awaited this moment, but then came feelings of uncertainty, amplified by the death of a close friend. The conceptual artist adopts an almost archaeological approach to the past and lays bare the process of writing a personal story that is intrinsically linked to the creation of her own identity. In this deeply felt debut she reveals the joyful aspects and also the dark recesses of transition and, bringing other testimonies into play as well, she critically examines what defines women as women.\"","popularity":0.3122,"poster_path":"/6ibsbwuuoz7nnTegGTT0KxNkLQ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119246,"logo_path":null,"name":"HER
