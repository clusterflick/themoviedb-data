The discovery inspired her to create a series of photographs of the figures. Standing in the street, the artist captured them in their ‘natural habitat,’ which is to say, behind a pane of glass. Folding the surrounding scene into the pictures, the reflections in the windows refract our gaze at the figures. On a semiotic level, urban architecture and the female body blend into each other. To expand this photographic series into the film Vienna Suite, Hafif resorted to a very basic device: she recorded the photographs with a static video camera and edited the footage to produce a sequence of ‘scenes.’","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/uE2WZ9G3xQmviqLEyktsgf7VtbK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vienna Suite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2118872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcia Hafif","original_name":"Marcia Hafif","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tRbXnwXEdvSciptT2r6aItCpTcA.jpg","credit_id":"6765b7eb87b92a43be5dfed4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uE2WZ9G3xQmviqLEyktsgf7VtbK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
