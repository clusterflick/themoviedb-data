A rapid stamping alerts their companions, who prepare the lassos; the ropes whistle, wind around the necks of the panicked beasts, which take a few more steps then, strangled and panting, are brought back captive. In the evening, they camp. Large fires are lit around which men and beasts settle down to sleep, not without a good guard being kept in the surrounding area. Meanwhile, the Apaches creep under cover of night to the American camp and succeed in seizing the captured beasts. Following this abduction, a frantic pursuit begins across the vast solitude of the Far West.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1907-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Apaches Du Far-West","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1754111","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
