It refers to the extreme capacity developed by Mumbai's inhabitants to adapt and get around any type of constraint or obstacle posed by the city's urban structure. In a relatively small piece of land where 21 million people live today, the inhabitants of Mumbai demonstrate great creativity when it comes to managing the spaces (for sale, for prayer, for traffic) and the flows that cross them every day. Without using language, Hong Kong artist Chak Hin Leung brings together in this video a dozen unique situations in which people, animals, vehicles and natural elements intermingle and brush up against each other, without ever colliding.","popularity":0.2663,"poster_path":"/t8A0TMaJ9z7kM5Pizcgp4pqe9hb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Creativity in Constraints: The Unseen Rhythm of Mumbai.","title":"Jugaad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5011736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chak Hin Leung","original_name":"Chak Hin Leung","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zxiA9KevJrLl1fvpcSlFGrgCmN9.jpg","credit_id":"6766ca0c8f10c2746b9101b8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5011736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chak Hin Leung","original_name":"Chak Hin Leung","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zxiA9KevJrLl1fvpcSlFGrgCmN9.jpg","credit_id":"6766ca171b06c5f28b74bd0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5011736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chak Hin Leung","original_name":"Chak Hin Leung","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zxiA9KevJrLl1fvpcSlFGrgCmN9.jpg","credit_id":"6766ca220b2fbb9dea5e20d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28612260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2319,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t8A0TMaJ9z7kM5Pizcgp4pqe9hb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":14636,"name":"india"},{"id":235231,"name":"urban planning"},{"id":253466,"name":"inhabitants"},{"id":280687,"name":"mumbai"},{"id":344088,"name":"jugaad"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
