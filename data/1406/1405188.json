Hardly any element on our planet is more important than water. Where there is water, life thrives. But only very few people know what wonderful creatures master their lives every day in their native habitats by the water. Far from our eyes, true dramas and glories happen every day. Stories that hardly anyone gets to see. Stories full of adventure, tragedy, comedy and even love.","popularity":0.744,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raindrop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130408,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marco Dominik Graf","original_name":"Marco Dominik Graf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6764c978774ac5a2857488fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130408,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marco Dominik Graf","original_name":"Marco Dominik Graf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6764c981ae1b411f405de208","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34960918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
