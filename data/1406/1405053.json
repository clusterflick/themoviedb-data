In late 1943 Neumann began to work on the Manhattan Project at the invitation of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and helped to design the first atomic bomb.\r This biography showcases the famous mathematician's work and legacy from the perspective of his daughter and colleagues. It is based on artefacts and documents from scientific history collections and on the personal memories of Marina von Neumann Whitman, Neumann's daughter.\r The film's production team has been filming all around the world, from Budapest to Los Alamos and Princeton, with the participation of several Hungarian and American scientists.","popularity":0.3175,"poster_path":"/xAhDUucxCJVelNPFImNfL0s5rlX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Most Brilliant Human Mind - John von Neumann","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Most Brilliant Human Mind","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3577345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lívia Bertha","original_name":"Lívia Bertha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67646439a6128944fba4fa9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210160,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tamás Lajos","original_name":"Tamás Lajos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/thRRYQkVa4WAaRBJcvyzJGaZDjN.jpg","credit_id":"67646458a6128944fba4fac1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476240,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dávid Szepesi","original_name":"Dávid Szepesi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676464dda6128944fba4fafc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2424024,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Duszka Péter Gábor","original_name":"Duszka Péter Gábor","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/9oCXpwzuYAfnPzWvJD2C6q0imkH.jpg","credit_id":"67646501a6128944fba4fb07","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5129864,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dózsa Péter","original_name":"Dózsa Péter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67646566b05011d6f3a4fbfc","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33291414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xAhDUucxCJVelNPFImNfL0s5rlX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6009,"name":"mathematics"},{"id":8689,"name":"albert einstein"},{"id":256253,"name":"computer science"},{"id":344003,"name":"a-bomb"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
