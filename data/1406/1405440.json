Their campaign, led by the National Association of Tenants Organisations (NATO), lasted for three long years before ending in success in August 1973.  This is their story, told through interviews with people who organised and participated in the campaign and their relatives. Though its success changed Irish housing policy forever, this story of Irish working class history is little documented and remembered - this documentary is a first in its attempt to summarise one of the state's biggest mass movements.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/z3u4epl0No81lo7nt3mxKGx7H64.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2024-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of Ireland's Housing Rebellion","title":"The Rent Strike","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5131162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Azzy O’Connor","original_name":"Azzy O’Connor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676584d38f10c2746b90d33c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5131163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dr. Fiadh Tubridy","original_name":"Dr. Fiadh Tubridy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676584e5ae1b411f405e053e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5131164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Declan Mallon","original_name":"Declan Mallon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676584f56ceba829b974a052","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34570680","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z3u4epl0No81lo7nt3mxKGx7H64.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArPriDp6yl13k53I2Y8t5TgWs6D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1410}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE RENT STRIKE - The Story of Ireland's Housing Rebellion","key":"bFgxCnSKqKI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-27T16:03:20.000Z","id":"676585346ceba829b974a061"}]}}}
