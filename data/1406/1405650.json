Here’s what they say about it:  “ I wrote this show after losing my grandfather and drowning in grief. I couldn't understand why people were wasting their time hating one another, when life is so precious and short. At the end of the day we are all beautifully and biologically mortal. When we remember that we are all eventually headed for death, most of living is the ultimate stand-up comedy.  BIOLOGY! is about learning how to hold both: our sorrow and our joy, tragedy and comedy. I weave comedy with poetry throughout to show that it is possible to be both the happiest and the saddest you've ever been at the same time.  I toured BIOLOGY! in 36 countries, and now it'll be available for you at home. With how hard everything is right now, l've decided to release it for free exclusively on my website. Please mark your calendars and spread the word. I can't wait to make you laugh. And cry. (Maybe at the same time).”","popularity":0.3727,"poster_path":"/1T02fOynRx3fDJvfETc1Q08ZYHP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alok: Biology!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1718961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ALOK","original_name":"ALOK","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/gjA7J3yUq4HXjdI4L8VG8uiMwUW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"ALOK","credit_id":"67660523ae1b411f405e181f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Guest","original_name":"Christopher Guest","popularity":0.4692,"profile_path":"/ofLhsKLZ4YAet8XIsNj7oA3blgh.jpg","credit_id":"677bdbb29cb089e051670406","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1718961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ALOK","original_name":"ALOK","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/gjA7J3yUq4HXjdI4L8VG8uiMwUW.jpg","credit_id":"677bdbdcc2eab1faf97488cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2678375,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Shamban","original_name":"David Shamban","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bdc1ec5070b8a46669976","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1961651,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John P.
