To achieve this, the filmmakers spent more than two years traveling around the country, attending vampire-related events, and interviewing dozens of people involved in the vampire community. Shooting locations include a Vampire’s Ball held in New Orleans each Halloween, a vampire tour of San Francisco, and a New York City shop that “transforms” people into vampires. Also featured are a vampire “dentist” who makes fangs for a living, vampire role playing gamers in Dayton, Ohio, a vampire-themed magician, and a bloodthirsty Texas couple that claims to be the real thing. Going beyond the surface, National Vampire also explores a number of subcultures that overlap the vampire community, including the goth music scene, bondage and S&M, and blood fetishists who take part in piercing and full-body suspension rituals.","popularity":0.5077,"poster_path":"/wri0lNmoVwf511EzdEG9aVWxLc6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Passim Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":88048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mimi Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beware: National Vampire is a documentary with bite.","title":"National Vampire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Fitzgerald","original_name":"Ron Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6764a2f9774ac5a285748369","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin V.
