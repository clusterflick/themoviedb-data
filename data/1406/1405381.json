Like that film, this film is an exploration of the material qualities of celluloid film in ways that are analogous to gestures in electronic music. Just as Black Taffy has sampled and reworked the soundtrack for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to create a new musical composition, this film samples and reworks images from its sequel Tears of the Kingdom, translating the interactive game world into a physical form.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lTtzgcERIxFNrFZ9FUHymabDGj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Zelda keeps on rolling","title":"Riding Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4556938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Alexander Morris","original_name":"Michael Alexander Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67655c6e03a3aa533090d739","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lTtzgcERIxFNrFZ9FUHymabDGj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
