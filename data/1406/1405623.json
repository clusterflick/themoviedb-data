When Vicky loses her job, she doesn't know what her next step is, but after a seemingly meaningless choice causes her life to fracture into two different timelines, we see that next step and more. In one timeline, Vicky returns to her unemployed, loser boyfriend, Dick, finds a low-paying job, and tries to move on with her life, never learning that Dick is secretly having an affair with his ex, Alexis. Meanwhile, in the other timeline, Vicky catches Dick cheating, breaks up with him, and meets a man, Trevor, who seems to be perfect in every wayexcept he has a secret that threatens to ruin everything. Can Vicky find happiness in either timeline, or is she doomed to make the same mistakes over and over again, no matter what universe she exists in?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dwhN3MFgh9E2jkLOsa0uy3MZuKX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6886,"logo_path":"/s39kM4kT4OCWZ1bopp4hjQXywQY.png","name":"Elegant Angel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silver Linings","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3625421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dharma Jones","original_name":"Dharma Jones","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/oJr1mzzekm2wP9TODEr0mZY0I5K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6765f7110b2fbb9dea5e0b90","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3766642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"August Skye","original_name":"August Skye","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/4LLL3bWctMRqUA4PmF5Rn1cflXJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6765f7276ceba829b974ae71","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2992629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freya Parker","original_name":"Freya Parker","popularity":4.106,"profile_path":"/srnnMrANqjhTE6ZcIN8R01oYUd3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6765f781330bce6ec990e994","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3668180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scarlett Alexis","original_name":"Scarlett Alexis","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/mqiaHmZPdNBCwUZymgKS1qjSHYQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6765f7ec90ee64af0674a9ed","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1110060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Driller","original_name":"Ryan Driller","popularity":11.875,"profile_path":"/9InfuI0jH2vyUiLcAxiCb5wtyCW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6765f8100b2fbb9dea5e0c1b","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1909553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Bronson","original_name":"Nathan Bronson","popularity":6.749,"profile_path":"/wWbUiHSgvZ9J3nZBdWwjxD3TXSy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6765f828330bce6ec990e9c5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1462982,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claudia Ross","original_name":"Claudia Ross","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6765f84d330bce6ec990e9da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwhN3MFgh9E2jkLOsa0uy3MZuKX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
