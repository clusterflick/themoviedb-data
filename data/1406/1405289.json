Dubbed the ‘Springburn Scorsese’ Price grew up amongst Scotland’s once prominent violent and territorial gang culture, an experience that he channels regularly into his storytelling. Visually, Price has a strong interest in reflecting the hardened realism of the scene but within a minimal and artistic framework that can feel poetic and deeply cinematic. DN is delighted to premiere Infectious Nihilism and Small Metallic Pieces of Hope on our pages today and caught up with Price, who at this point has become a true DN alum, for a chat about the creative inspiration he draws from his own life, his cinematic approach as a self-taught working-class filmmaker, and his latest project Skint with Scottish acting and filmmaking legend Peter Mullan.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infectious Nihilism and Small Metallic Pieces of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1372903,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"James Price","original_name":"James Price","popularity":0.1831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6765100d71680b82ae90c9a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15516694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
