His works were not only on marine subjects. In this short we can also see the church of St. Sarkis, where the artist was baptized. He was married within the walls of this ancient temple, and his funeral service was held there in 1900. Modern photos of Armenia and Western Armenia, where Aivazovsky's ancestors were from, harmoniously complement the film. And at last, the picturesque views of Feodosia, the city where the artist lived and worked for many years.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/paxCH3VVZ64Q5kJzB2Nt3QYhRPj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4484,"logo_path":"/qWC0eR60XPtyONfPQwVMKQ9pZS8.png","name":"Armenia Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1983-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aivazovsky and Armenia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Aivazovskin yev Hayastane","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Айвазовский и Армения","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5131718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pargev Malayan","original_name":"Պարգև Մալայան","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6765d656919287ef5390e1eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Vartanov","original_name":"Mikhail Vartanov","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/zd0BoWcad4aV0gUY0QRQpAcgtvv.jpg","credit_id":"6765d6d60b2fbb9dea5e0554","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5131740,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shahen Khachatryan","original_name":"Շահեն Խաչատրյան","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6765d88f330bce6ec990e407","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0320811","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gZutULcTbImmThzmlNfZfiHMDek.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2450,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/paxCH3VVZ64Q5kJzB2Nt3QYhRPj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
