I wanted to experiment with this film, hence the strange premise. The film was directed, edited and filmed by me and I was also responsible for the base story. A lot of the film was highly improvised and I would decide on what direction to take the film as we walked around looking for walls. This film was really fun to make and I learnt a lot about film-making in the process.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Templar Film Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eimhin","original_name":"Eimhin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"628e20d2ed2ac2758b3bf778","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
