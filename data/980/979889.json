Kim has her dogs. Kim has her faith. Kim struggles, every day: with anxiety, for a bit of normality, to stand on her own two feet. Kim’s mother, Lore, was deported to Auschwitz at the age of six. To this day, Lore is a DP, a displaced person. Lore has her index cards. From morning till night, she transcribes articles from the daily newspaper, archiving them in boxes and baskets. All her life, Lore has been silent: about her mother, about the hiding place where she survived, about Tom, her son, Kim’s brother, who took his own life. Kim instead wants to talk: about her childhood with Lore, about Tom, about the scarred lives they both lead.","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":"/nw22CfPtzVTQchfJt6yTFVt6eWn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185112,"logo_path":"/7p4Wn4Hl4uRHtjXbmyF4ylo8q4D.png","name":"Freischwimmer Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liebe Angst","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1830426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Schüle","original_name":"Susanne Schüle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e4bc3d48cee2cbfcd7cd6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1150105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandra Prechtel","original_name":"Sandra Prechtel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e4bad2495ab74dbdad367","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1150105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandra Prechtel","original_name":"Sandra Prechtel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e4bb67f05400066d1ef8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21104132","wikidata_id":"Q116790581","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1006,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/nw22CfPtzVTQchfJt6yTFVt6eWn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfest München","release_date":"2022-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
