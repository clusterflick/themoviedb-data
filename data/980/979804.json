Well, when the boss is out one day, a friend of Torchy's has friends come to see him. Torchy wants his friend to make a great impression, so he sneaks him into the boss' office and has him pose as the boss! Soon, however, the boss arrives but instead of exposing the ruse, he goes along with it. But he also convinces Torchy to do a job for him...to sneak some venison past the game warden. It seems the boss wants to serve it to friends and win some odd bet.","popularity":0.1374,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35282,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.C.
