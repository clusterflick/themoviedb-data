The Ground Between Us is the story of three Native tribal organizations fighting for their future in Alaska, Oregon, and Utah as executive orders and presidential proclamations threaten to change their lives forever. As public land throughout the country makes the headlines of nearly every community newspaper and television station in the country, we are left to ask, how public lands can become the uniting factor in a divided America?","popularity":0.0877,"poster_path":"/6To1dmMljSNVxMw71iwNdUsnZVK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ground Between Us","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galen Knowles","original_name":"Galen Knowles","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cd66c1a32483b630d9490","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3555233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zeppelin Zeerip","original_name":"Zeppelin Zeerip","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cd67aed2ac259c77de87b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9545340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"thegroundbetweenus","instagram_id":"thegroundbetweenus","twitter_id":"groundbetweenus"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u4cirURibIPgnR7U1P1cvFPMGsm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1869}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6To1dmMljSNVxMw71iwNdUsnZVK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gcCorinOYYIHQDUr6ChW3L6HF1I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Colorado Alliance for Environmental Education","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Livestream + Q&A","release_date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"UNwyKgi3tcs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-04-26T17:51:38.000Z","id":"628cd69f2495ab74dbd65924"}]}}}
