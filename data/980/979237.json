Charley is her devoted lover, but his bashfulness prevents him from proposing. She has a daughter, Lilly, who is visiting in a nearby town. She accepts Heinie subject to her mother's approval. The mother cannot see it and wires her daughter that she cannot marry the young man unless he shows her $5,000. She orders the girl home. Heinie says that he has a brother living near the widow's houseboat and that he will accompany Lilly home so as to be on the ground. Heinie and Charley are very much alike, in fact, the only difference between the brothers is in the way in which they wear their mustaches.","popularity":0.059,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bashful Charley's Proposal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Franey","original_name":"Billy Franey","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/k1NKW0GxaRTqpe6UOGWeDcnxXrR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Charley","credit_id":"628c12b71a3248179739ae08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gale Henry","original_name":"Gale Henry","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/dLa3f1fyHaUTPdXOJN0B6lixKlc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Widow","credit_id":"628c12c9209f1812c5578397","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Curtis","original_name":"Allen Curtis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628c128f1fb94f009c69f89f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0328874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
