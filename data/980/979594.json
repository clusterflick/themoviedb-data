Berhault's evolutions, in the sea, in the grottoes, on the rocks and precipices, are exceedingly difficult but they are chiefly performed to give the movement an aesthetic value. Matemorphosis is the story of a cycle without words, narrated with gestures and music. The climber Monique Dalmasso also partecipates in the film.","popularity":0.2679,"poster_path":"/u24ZUmFiljLGyoT9ZNaAFXz7W3G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metamorfosi","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2276123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Berhault","original_name":"Patrick Berhault","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/tL6zAny69N6vwJpLNAs3OdElcX1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"628d5244ed2ac259c657b380","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3562723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Dalmasso","original_name":"Monica Dalmasso","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/9OOY4MH8oemoXrQZGyQutoFq2dE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"628d52551495650050c773f3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562739,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sking","original_name":"Sking","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d531a1495650050c7775b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562727,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrice Aubertel","original_name":"Patrice Aubertel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d52926f31af00506507a2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562742,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Renato Soldini","original_name":"Renato Soldini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d534f75110d009f720602","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562725,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renato Volger","original_name":"Renato Volger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d52836f31af0066f19838","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255471,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alberto Buletti","original_name":"Alberto Buletti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d52d1b6abc4009d1e4b0b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Soldini","original_name":"Bruno Soldini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d52aa7d5db51b29221914","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562741,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Iska Von Unwerth","original_name":"Iska Von Unwerth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d53357d5db51b2aa909d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562730,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Romolo Nottaris","original_name":"Romolo Nottaris","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/12vXsq0hGzpgUdXjxzquQestYXV.jpg","credit_id":"628d529e6f31af00506507af","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Soldini","original_name":"Bruno Soldini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bcf60beb64f10089345668","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gMOcZl9bpPefKcukpkENQNmTaQe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bg87rW1V1NT7m5t8yIxjxc6aX5H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i6FwUFNt4wr3p9mYzoUJUwTnOTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kOMXNUdykUjm2JovUf9JTRWuWME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u24ZUmFiljLGyoT9ZNaAFXz7W3G.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45tf4lrwBH9WWuGbWcct1YPwUoU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197623,"name":"free climbing"},{"id":272233,"name":"escalade"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":299267,"name":"patrick berhault"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
