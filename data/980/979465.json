Soon after this, he goes to a speakeasy and begins chatting up women. One in particular catches his eye and so he brings her home to meet the wife. And here's where it gets weird. Apparently the Gleasons have an agreement that if either meets another person and falls for them, the marriage will be amicably dissolved and they'll each go their separate ways!
