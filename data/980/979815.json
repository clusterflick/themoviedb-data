The seemingly serious story, lightly wrapped in a great sense of comedy, will make you laugh, feel sad, and feel sorry for yourself as you are drawn into the world, and in the end, you will love all the characters.  　A very orthodox, yet unlikely comedy. Well-made, but never scheduled, this play is sure to satisfy you beyond your expectations. We are proud to present \"Father's Love - Family Tale\" in the hope that more and more people will experience the happiness of watching a play. Please look forward to it.","popularity":0.1959,"poster_path":"/3PUCu6Uzc7KgSWBq8dRNn7kJUCM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"お父さんの恋","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Family Tale","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masato Sakai","original_name":"堺雅人","popularity":1.3985,"profile_path":"/qWylwebPgcOOM3pWHBesGU1MLGZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"杉本大樹","credit_id":"628e1d77d48cee2cbd8561ac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162715,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mayumi Nakatani","original_name":"Mayumi Nakatani","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629047d631644b0068cd4b4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/3PUCu6Uzc7KgSWBq8dRNn7kJUCM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6415,"name":"stage show"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
