The film describes four layers of Russian history: the liberation of Moscow by the militia of Minin and Pozharsky, the battle of Poltava, the Patriotic War of 1812 and the Great Patriotic War. During all these events, the Orthodox inhabitants of Tatarstan turned to their protector, the icon of the Kazan Mother of God, for help. It is believed that the icon was carried away in 1611 by the Kazan militia and later helped Minin and Pozharsky liberate Moscow from the Poles.","popularity":0.27,"poster_path":"/xO9JNtOafr5ynJVn8xk0gMdcKQK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Заступница","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Zastupnitsa","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitriy Dyuzhev","original_name":"Дмитрий Дюжев","popularity":0.7022,"profile_path":"/ar0CMyQmBwvlr5CbZ3vvfvuWbou.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"628d56e35be00e005087ee0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Kupchenko","original_name":"Ирина Купченко","popularity":0.5915,"profile_path":"/5OPmjaCRjbh0BwqOUNnBz6dAjfa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"628d56eadf86a800505eef84","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolay Burlyaev","original_name":"Николай Бурляев","popularity":0.2905,"profile_path":"/fRiS9kWiolLH3J8ZhfLqmq51igm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"628d56f27d5db51b2aa91679","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":235877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Budina","original_name":"Ольга Будина","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/mknoybh915CiQYfWFMjQDKaUSrl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"628d56f9ed2ac259c77faece","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Barykin","original_name":"Alexey Barykin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d5702d48cee2cbfca8af6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Barykin","original_name":"Alexey Barykin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d574ced2ac259c657c331","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Barykin","original_name":"Alexey Barykin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d570a9a643500509bd5c1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Barykin","original_name":"Alexey Barykin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d570fdf86a800a600fbb7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562748,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ramil Akhmetov","original_name":"Ramil Akhmetov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d5732d48cee2cbd82fde2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2214003,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Marina Barykina","original_name":"Marina Barykina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d5746209f1812c49f65bd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562747,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Farit Galiev","original_name":"Farit Galiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628d571bfed59700503b1829","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22646578","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/xO9JNtOafr5ynJVn8xk0gMdcKQK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kazan International Muslim Film Festival","release_date":"2013-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
