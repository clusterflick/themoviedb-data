He turns to Manuel, his German-born childhood friend, to translate the documents. Manuel, who hails from a family steeped in cinematic history and whose aunt was married to Stanley Kubrick, reveals that he too has recently uncovered a dark family secret: his father's uncle was the infamous Nazi filmmaker Veit Harlan, director of the film \"Jud Suss\" - banned from screening to the present day and considered the most notorious anti-Semitic propaganda film in history. Together they embark on a voyage to Berlin to discover more about their respective pasts- a journey which puts their friendship to the test.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/lW1ArT0GU4YPvhUvqiTc7OcE2m9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back in Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15533750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lW1ArT0GU4YPvhUvqiTc7OcE2m9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
