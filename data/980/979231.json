John lost his purse and Frank found it. Then he went to the former's house and Matilda thought her hubby was crazy because he did not recognize her. Frank had forgotten his badge, and so could not prove his identity, and was taken to the insane asylum. But Bess discovered that Frank left his badge and went to the first house on his list to give it to him. At the corner she met John looking for the wallet. He liked her and said that he would take her to lunch. When he arrived home he thought that Matilda was crazy, and sent to the asylum for help.","popularity":0.1365,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inspector's Double","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Franey","original_name":"Billy Franey","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/k1NKW0GxaRTqpe6UOGWeDcnxXrR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John","credit_id":"628c10a96dea3a00518a8974","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gale Henry","original_name":"Gale Henry","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/dLa3f1fyHaUTPdXOJN0B6lixKlc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Matilda","credit_id":"628c10be6c84927186721351","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Beaudine","original_name":"William Beaudine","popularity":0.2333,"profile_path":"/3ZU7jfJuEBbJenUSXAX7DhqzTqA.jpg","credit_id":"628c104f0b7316006612bf4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0326974","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
