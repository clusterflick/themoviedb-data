The WHO alarms that we could fall back into a \"post-antibiotic age\". The film tells us how we got there: It is a story about how negligence, greed, and short-sightedness have rendered the lifesaving effects of antibiotics powerless. It is a science-thriller about disillusioned, fighting doctors, rebellious scientists, patients wrestling with life-threatening diseases and diplomats searching for a global solution. They all are Resistance Fighters.","popularity":0.5227,"poster_path":"/1vOyhcnhGCbSec7IC2j33tpWn7k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":53038,"logo_path":"/jid7GftH5OzLOvLhanVcTVBOr52.png","name":"Broadview Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resistance Fighters – The Global Antibiotics Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Stille Pandemie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Winczewski","original_name":"Patrick Winczewski","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/xXnY5oU0R8nxxuUcyZAhBYTiDLY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5c949312c3a3683dbff213a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanveer Ahmed","original_name":"Tanveer Ahmed","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self - Ass.
