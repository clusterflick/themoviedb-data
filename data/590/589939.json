Still today LOURDES is more alive than ever. And Our Lady remains active and attentive to each of her children. About 6 million people visit it every year. After the pandemic, her devotion is increasing. The multitudinous processions of people seeking a miracle feed a small army of caregivers (nurses, volunteers, hospitalists) who accompany them. These pilgrims are an amazing display of humanity: accident victims, the terminally ill, an overweight teenager being bullied at school, a group of prostitutes and trans people from Paris, etc. LOURDES is an insightful meditation on the human capacity for empathy and hope, and especially a journey into the mystery of religious faith in the face of life's profound tribulations.","popularity":0.3307,"poster_path":"/oQPwpdAaL51nt7h1fTPJ8OoMFuA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123176,"logo_path":"/1xfVfLus4m7J7LkbuPM4yPy4Aqp.png","name":"Falabracks","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":23123,"logo_path":"/cEqVIluQuO1ubtID8RvOem4ZiIg.png","name":"Mars
