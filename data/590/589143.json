The film follows the stories of Mexican-American winemakers and migrant workers who are essential to the wine business, yet are rarely recognized for their contributions. Their stories unfold as wildfires ignite in Napa and Sonoma counties, threatening the livelihoods of small farmers and winemakers who are already grappling with a growing labor shortage, shifting immigration policies, and the impacts of a rapidly changing climate.","popularity":0.4601,"poster_path":"/fxZQMP0by4x4844FIMFB8GXspeI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quiet Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":105516,"logo_path":"/j1FgbOz1NFwt6iEhdd05dWwr7Z2.png","name":"Latino Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harvest Season","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernardo Ruiz","original_name":"Bernardo Ruiz","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/3YFpImZsDYM9Ow3BXFCnpUWGUK1.jpg","credit_id":"5c9060b40e0a26130259f9df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314657,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Capps","original_name":"Lauren Capps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0aee0e0a260f6ecaa329","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245557,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Jo Fifer","original_name":"Sally Jo Fifer","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0c630e0a26601ecaad9a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314663,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brady Kendall","original_name":"Brady Kendall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0b820e0a265058caa7ce","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Cordoba","original_name":"Andrea Cordoba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0b620e0a260d50caa845","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernardo Ruiz","original_name":"Bernardo Ruiz","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/3YFpImZsDYM9Ow3BXFCnpUWGUK1.jpg","credit_id":"5cde0c260e0a261dd5caabd7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641036,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Kinomoto","original_name":"Michael Kinomoto","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0c490e0a26262bcbe1dd","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314660,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Victor Tadashi Suarez","original_name":"Victor Tadashi Suarez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0b2a0e0a261dd5caa9c0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lois Vossen","original_name":"Lois Vossen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0c7b9251411d83cd6966","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2314658,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fiona Otway","original_name":"Fiona Otway","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0b0ac3a3685e74c00501","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucas Smith","original_name":"Lucas Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cde0b4fc3a36863f8c003d9","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7232968","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fxZQMP0by4x4844FIMFB8GXspeI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":677}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DOC NYC","release_date":"2018-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer | Harvest Season | Independent Lens | PBS","key":"lNRQ3t3FEo8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-04-12T19:30:02.000Z","id":"5cde0e209251414447cd6c72"}]}}}
