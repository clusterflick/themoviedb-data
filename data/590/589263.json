William Shakespeare and his company of actors are brought together with the formidable Queen Elizabeth I in a remarkable encounter on the night of April 22, 1616, hours before the execution of Elizabeth's former lover Essex. Through the course of the evening, actor Ned Lowenscroft, famous for his female roles in Shakespeares' plays, very touchingly teaches the Queen to be more of a woman, while the Queen helps Ned be more of a man. Part history lesson, part theatrical insight, the play is a beautifully crafted Shakespeare-like work with poignant reflections on grief, love, friendship, and art. Compelling performances are delivered by Diane D'Aquila as Queen Elizabeth, Peter Hutt as Shakespeare and Brent Carver as Ned Lowenscroft.","popularity":0.1784,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":31092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stratford Festival","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elizabeth Rex","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dianne D'Aquila","original_name":"Dianne D'Aquila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Elizabeth Rex","credit_id":"5c9111419251410fe7a60047","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brent Carver","original_name":"Brent Carver","popularity":0.1052,"profile_path":"/pUgg4fwYkI8cl7Rf4QXeJf6MLAu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ned Lowenscroft","credit_id":"5c9111550e0a2613045b766c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hutt","original_name":"Peter Hutt","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Will Shakespeare","credit_id":"5c911161c3a368611950f99f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":404229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Timothy Findley","original_name":"Timothy Findley","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/nvf0qeMu8ziDMl6acFMv0Eh7SkB.jpg","credit_id":"62984bc01e922500641f1c43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3572699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Henry","original_name":"Martha Henry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62984bfad48cee2c45c7940c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0369386","wikidata_id":"Q3723414","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
