Pianist and Schnabel devotee Markus Pawlik (in collaboration with baritone Dietrich Henschel and the Szymanowski String Quartet) brings Artur Schnabel's greatest compositions back to Berlin with a filmed commemorative concert. Along the way, Pawlik visits the places, landscapes, and history that shaped Schnabel's life and music. \"Artur Schnabel: No Place of Exile\" rediscovers an essential artist displaced by the catastrophe of the two World Wars and the Holocaust and inspired by the possibilities of modernism.","popularity":0.3896,"poster_path":"/l65GNcDfupFebh2xgb8SvhYkxc9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artur Schnabel: No Place of Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2269410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Arlen","original_name":"Walter Arlen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c9239ba0e0a2612f15da048","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Bamberger","original_name":"Jeanne Bamberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c9239c20e0a2612ef5d8cd1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodolfo Augusto Faistauer","original_name":"Rodolfo Augusto Faistauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Artur Schnabel","credit_id":"5c9239cb0e0a2612f55d6c3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Fleisher","original_name":"Leon Fleisher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c9239d49251410ff4a86630","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4106980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artur Schnabel","original_name":"Artur Schnabel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive)","credit_id":"6485c4d9e2726000c93106a9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietrich Henschel","original_name":"Dietrich Henschel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rlXUPs1jN95EmipMvhHexaqKG7s.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6485c520e2726001287a4d98","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Pawlik","original_name":"Markus Pawlik","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6485c52cd2b20900ca1fd40d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nike Martens","original_name":"Nike Martens","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/2dkmXwr9Gc45JoBbnTkA9bqAcLK.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Therese Behr-Schnabel","credit_id":"6485c53de2726001287a4dae","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Flückiger","original_name":"Julia Flückiger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6485c54c99259c01392bc041","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arianna Gremigni","original_name":"Arianna Gremigni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mary Virginia Foreman","credit_id":"6485c55cc9dbf90100cbf499","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Mishory","original_name":"Matthew Mishory","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/97Dq35RVW6kiXSsBPky6d3BCbGI.jpg","credit_id":"61ffcf498f26bc001c7a778f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5136064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l65GNcDfupFebh2xgb8SvhYkxc9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":14743,"name":"pianist"},{"id":191028,"name":"concert pianist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
