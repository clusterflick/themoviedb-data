With a driving soundtrack and bold visuals, Almy satirically presents this dynamic simulation of media politics as a fast-paced music clip. The narrator is a disembodied Big Brother, an Orwellian computer program who creates candidate images—dictator, evangelist, moderate—as models for a mass-marketed leader. The image of the potential president is overlaid with graphic symbols of multinational power: technology; economics; warfare. As a woman hysterically intones, \"We've got to have a perfect leader,\" the bland, telegenic candidate is brought into two dimensions on the TV screen. Concise as a commercial, insistent as a pop song, Perfect Leader is Almy's most effective use of television techniques to critique the impact of the media on contemporary life.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/ieXxIwG92nmRwmDKIv1BXVI2E7r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perfect Leader","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268952,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roy Sablosky","original_name":"Roy Sablosky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c916ee70e0a2663c752789a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181766,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Claire Doyle","original_name":"Claire Doyle","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c916f179251410feaa6e213","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1015892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Jones","original_name":"Gregory Jones","popularity":0.1294,"profile_path":"/arukbRBUpgMFzmq3XHnAgieHyd9.jpg","credit_id":"5c916ec29251410ffca6cf98","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Almy","original_name":"Max Almy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c916e519251410feda6c1b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268951,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bud Ryerson","original_name":"Bud Ryerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c916e880e0a266237593aec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1494,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ieXxIwG92nmRwmDKIv1BXVI2E7r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":996}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
