The traditional side of a genre that few people know about in the contemporary Peruvian music scene. Taking as a starting point the celebration of a birthday, the documentary shows interviews and musical performances of a group of veteran criollo singers -most of them over 70 years old- who incorporated music as an everyday thing. They show us how their life and their traditions mimic music, keeping it alive despite the disinterest and oblivion of the general public.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ve3VdEcpA2ACKCmYoUjrwSF6Hbc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127394,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tamare Films","origin_country":""},{"id":247557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sayariy Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2011-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lima Bruja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","title":"Lima Bruja, retratos de la música criolla","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Terry","original_name":"Willy Terry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Él mismo","credit_id":"6760fb135c7a1edb1bb4f612","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Papeo Abán","original_name":"Papeo Abán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Él mismo","credit_id":"6760fb2c5c7a1edb1bb4f625","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Goyburu","original_name":"Walter Goyburu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Él mismo","credit_id":"6760fb5c52ccac57cfcbd892","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manolo Castillo","original_name":"Manolo Castillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Él mismo","credit_id":"6760fb6abb15907cd3189349","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesar Oliva","original_name":"Cesar Oliva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Él mismo","credit_id":"6760fb7fd183d1e25ccbd8ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lencho Pedraza","original_name":"Lencho Pedraza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Él mismo","credit_id":"6760fb8cbb15907cd3189362","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genaro Falcón","original_name":"Genaro Falcón","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Él mismo","credit_id":"6760fb99bb15907cd3189370","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Avilés","original_name":"Lucy Avilés","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6760fbb5d183d1e25ccbd907","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Polar","original_name":"Rafael Polar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c942d5ac3a3682e53f205d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Polar","original_name":"Rafael Polar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760fbdcb80a974245cbd955","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124523,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Javier Becerra Heraud","original_name":"Javier Becerra Heraud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760fc175c7a1edb1bb4f6b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/5yfWQ7AyZRl5ZHPDMCecFj7rtfv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ve3VdEcpA2ACKCmYoUjrwSF6Hbc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldaeloRxmYvO8ab3swp16CWSNEy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
