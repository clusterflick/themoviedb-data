During the height of the women’s movement, Noel, a former teen model and Playboy bunny, meets and falls in love with Selma, a tough, outspoken radical feminist. Both women choose to leave their comfortable, yet unsatisfying marriages and children to come out as lesbians. The two share a love of cooking and gardening and, in the ’70s, open Bloodroot, the first vegetarian collective restaurant and bookstore in Bridgeport, Connecticut. By interspersing archival footage and clips from The Stepford Wives, Tirola affectionately chronicles the cultural shifts of the last 40 years as Noel and Selma attempt to keep Bloodroot open as an indispensable gathering spot for progressive women.","popularity":0.473,"poster_path":"/iB1z8QCEsy5qtrQQMOVjATVSSV4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloodroot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":91186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Tirola","original_name":"Douglas Tirola","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c93f93ec3a3682e4df1b3c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10535146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9rZKa8SLJhGTI2jzsehfbnQgURv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iB1z8QCEsy5qtrQQMOVjATVSSV4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":1946,"name":"restaurant"},{"id":6981,"name":"connecticut"},{"id":155851,"name":"book store"},{"id":196944,"name":"vegetarianism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
