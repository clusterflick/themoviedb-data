This is the last station on earth for old people that called “clients”.  While they’re waiting for the end of their lives, prisoned in a desolate nursing home and their old-dying body,  they are fighting for the freedom of their soul, the only place they can feel young and alive.  A fight between light and darkness, suffering and acceptance, life and death.","popularity":0.7423,"poster_path":"/bpfjzs3VDzDiSH8X7tZvw4Cueae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Okapi Creative Studio","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":131245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nezavisni filmski centar \"Filmart\"","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2019-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valley of the Rulers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Emek HaShalitim","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Dolina vladara: Valley of the Rulers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2268046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Efim Graboy","original_name":"Efim Graboy","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/g0HUT1yxK8AP2DlfEotE25lJi3J.jpg","credit_id":"5c900d7f925141409fa20a2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2268046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Efim Graboy","original_name":"Efim Graboy","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/g0HUT1yxK8AP2DlfEotE25lJi3J.jpg","credit_id":"5c900d8bc3a36861194f5768","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050842,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dejan Petrović","original_name":"Dejan Petrović","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c900ddac3a36861164f73c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arvo Pärt","original_name":"Arvo Pärt","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/bq7OliFL8gf9ERIck9jhPivfv7z.jpg","credit_id":"5c900e330e0a2612fc595b70","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268055,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daria Turetski","original_name":"Daria Turetski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c900fd2c3a36861114f1250","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Milena Smigić","original_name":"Milena Smigić","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c900fe7925141409fa20e8a","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268057,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Levkin","original_name":"Anton Levkin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c900ffa9251410ff6a4a69a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268058,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Walid Messnaoui","original_name":"Walid Messnaoui","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c901009925141409fa20eb2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268059,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Constanza Sandoval","original_name":"Constanza Sandoval","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c90101bc3a3681c954c4667","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268060,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Predrag Živković","original_name":"Predrag Živković","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c901035c3a3681c954c4696","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7884290","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bpfjzs3VDzDiSH8X7tZvw4Cueae.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3032,"name":"suffering"},{"id":7307,"name":"routine"},{"id":1262,"name":"mountain"},{"id":4995,"name":"aging"},{"id":7492,"name":"serbia"},{"id":17937,"name":"desolate"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":155208,"name":"nursing home"},{"id":160963,"name":"elderly couple"},{"id":197702,"name":"day in a life"},{"id":208873,"name":"acceptance"},{"id":220328,"name":"elder care"},{"id":223221,"name":"accepting death"},{"id":235487,"name":"metaphysical"},{"id":243248,"name":"elderly widow"},{"id":252797,"name":"elder"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Valley of The Rulers - Trailer (BSDFF 2019)","key":"fZbZAMBobas","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-31T19:29:59.000Z","id":"5c9137c80e0a2612f15bb24b"}]}}}
