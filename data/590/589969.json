Johan van der Keuken analyzes the relationships between art and reality, morality and the political, gives his conception of exchanges and conflicts between interiority and the outside world. He explains with precision this research which goes at all to the intimate, and which did not progress without rejections and moments of doubt. Shortly before his death, he had reviewed this document and wanted it to be shown as such, in its unedited state.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/rQtVLxc1VR1wGDky9M1APA70lx5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Entretien (avec Johan van der Keuken)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"5c94bff3c3a3682e55f2f6f1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017758,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Besnier","original_name":"Françoise Besnier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648359c999259c00e2f441fc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Childeric","original_name":"Claire Childeric","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c94c042c3a3682e53f2ea94","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Nouel","original_name":"Thierry Nouel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c94c01c0e0a2645fb4fe176","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1821392,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laurent Malan","original_name":"Laurent Malan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c94c06fc3a3682e5ff30bf5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1423,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rQtVLxc1VR1wGDky9M1APA70lx5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":950}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
