This line is comparable to a crease in the pages of the family album, but also to a crack in the walls of the paternal house. It resembles the open wound created when drilling into a mountain, but also a scar in the collective imaginary of a society, where the idea of salvation finds its tragic destiny in the political struggle. What is at the end of that line? Will old war songs be enough to circumvent that destiny?","popularity":1.3053,"poster_path":"/gSBxf47BCuMnSl9CgwND3b547nW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kleinen filmak","origin_country":""},{"id":116100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montehermoso Kulturunea","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The personal stories lived by the Uncle, the Father and the Son, respectively, draw a line through the collective Basque imaginary.
