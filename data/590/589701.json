Begun a matter of weeks after first meeting, the film charts a deepening artistic and personal relationship exploring the nature of skin, family, death, water, desire and, throughout, a powerful will to form. Akbari looks into the connection between her body and the political history of Iran, investigating the relationship between her own physical traumas and the collective political memory of her birthplace. As she undergoes surgeries on a body decimated by cancer, remembrance and reconstruction provide a framework for investigating how bodies are traumatised, censored and politicized, and yet ultimately remain a site of possibility.","popularity":0.1718,"poster_path":"/4ppyRv7uM7wC23qNNUvkfSzZVi0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2019-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Moon for My Father","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Ksiezyc dla mojego ojca","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mania Akbari","original_name":"Mania Akbari","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/iJqcCR11JRQitOUjMYtBWCXv9G.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c93527f9251412b5c781d70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas White","original_name":"Douglas White","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c9352f4c3a3685899e3562f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas White","original_name":"Douglas White","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9352640e0a26103fe8424c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mania Akbari","original_name":"Mania Akbari","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/iJqcCR11JRQitOUjMYtBWCXv9G.jpg","credit_id":"5c935252c3a36861a8e37973","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas White","original_name":"Douglas White","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c935243c3a36861b3e37fda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mania Akbari","original_name":"Mania Akbari","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/iJqcCR11JRQitOUjMYtBWCXv9G.jpg","credit_id":"5c935225c3a36861a8e378cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7160092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v1HxJqKoVL3qLjNFAsf7K4E2PIV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ppyRv7uM7wC23qNNUvkfSzZVi0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH:DOX","release_date":"2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Horizons Film Festival","release_date":"2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Garage Screen","release_date":"2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Odesa International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Moon for My Father (Trailer @ CPH:DOX 2019)","key":"VD1N3aGa7WI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-17T17:22:21.000Z","id":"5de2e02bc51acd0011f8a515"}]}}}
