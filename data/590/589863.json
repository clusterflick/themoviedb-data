At the core of @Large were portraits of prisoners of conscience coupled with the opportunity to write letters of solidarity to the imprisoned. In her impassioned and powerful film, exhibition curator Cheryl Haines visits several current and former prisoners, including American whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and learns how these letters were vital to their survival.  “The misconception of totalitarianism is that freedom can be imprisoned. This is not the case. When you constrain freedom, freedom will take flight and land on a windowsill.”  — Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.1942,"poster_path":"/eGNX7nOXzI8OyzidKKjbHYR8aqg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ai Weiwei: Yours Truly","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Weiwei","original_name":"Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/hD3ot74TFao8xDaeUaxuRK0RKsS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60230ef7c669ad003fc2329b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1353532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelsea Manning","original_name":"Chelsea Manning","popularity":0.0908,"profile_path":"/5ezCqJpWsgpfxkoxi3EJoKclOGK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60231038c669ad003dc25439","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3891689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Munroe","original_name":"Alexandra Munroe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/5m7j0NH67vzU3vTBnRktWsXkFtx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d2b140cb71b800d43a4bd1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheryl Haines","original_name":"Cheryl Haines","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c93ff4dc3a3682e5bf1b3f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10171988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.589,"height":1172,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lNxB9sN9aVfleAfxd8p6HcJMx34.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1862},{"aspect_ratio":1.589,"height":1172,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6fhAtHvHyHpKlXXIIWwVs16OHmC.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1862}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1519,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lSZGqBFrLh2WR24pz30ZN1gsVhl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eGNX7nOXzI8OyzidKKjbHYR8aqg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
