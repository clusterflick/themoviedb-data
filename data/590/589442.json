Is there a relationship between these forgotten formats and the discontinued political ideologies that they depict?  Transferred from Super-8 and then processed using a combination of high-end digital and vintage analog processing techniques, Apeshit emphasizes the contradictory references found in both the original text and its adaptation. Serving up Battle for the Planet of the Apes as proof, Apeshit puts forth tolerance as an outmoded technology.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/7GfqyEct4IInIWt6RiHjnXBQku8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apeshit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1885100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"L.
