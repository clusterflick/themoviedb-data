Over the course of this unforgettable group portrait, Subhi (from Syria), Junior (from Congo), and Mari and Cheyenne (from Angola) experience roadblocks and triumphs as they reflect on their respective histories and try to create a home for themselves in an environment that is not always welcoming. Once in San Francisco, they are met with setbacks but each maintains hope for a better future – Mari and Cheyenne record an album, Subhi starts a tour speaking on behalf of Syrian refugees and finds love, while Junior faces challenges of homelessness and gender non-conformance.","popularity":0.5242,"poster_path":"/j31FDwykvBp8I2cjE8NemOyTMVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Door Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsettled: Seeking Refuge in America","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Shepard","original_name":"Tom Shepard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cae95279251412f9d21358c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103694,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eva Ilona Brzeski","original_name":"Eva Ilona Brzeski","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cae961a0e0a2626cec18ee0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103693,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Justin Melland","original_name":"Justin Melland","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed00a1ce61e6d001ece2bf1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jen Gilomen","original_name":"Jen Gilomen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed00a29e4b57600202c62ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Shepard","original_name":"Tom Shepard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed00a31aaec7100216776e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846769,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrew Black","original_name":"Andrew Black","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed00a4be4b57600202c62be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jen Gilomen","original_name":"Jen Gilomen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed00a53528b2e001e660ef9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658104,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Seely","original_name":"Mike Seely","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed00a6621c4ca0020deefb1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10478556","wikidata_id":"Q128830359","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/daSSJFTpBXTMkTnwUc1im0c6eai.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ZBOOh351vlnkqRE8BTtUswjnRk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j31FDwykvBp8I2cjE8NemOyTMVZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":703}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":582,"name":"san francisco, california"},{"id":972,"name":"refugee"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":233536,"name":"syrian refugee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International PRIDE Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"San Francisco International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
