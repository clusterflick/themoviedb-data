Futile, as we all know. Nevertheless, he suffers a crisis of identity about himself, his world, and the forests and glades he so loves. Two days after the disappearing of his gundog Birko, Horst plunges deep into the forest to try and find the wayward pooch, and in doing so, re-immerses himself in his beloved natural world. He hears barking and ploughs on, in search of Birko. Deeper and deeper he goes. What will he discover, deep in the bosky depths?","popularity":0.0831,"poster_path":"/knnNl0RRB7hZASQrPiOUVOF0oyQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkness Is A Color","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfo Assor","original_name":"Adolfo Assor","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/j86mqVuCa75kIEyi3yb8inM1KHf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Horst","credit_id":"5c92161d9251410feaa8039e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliane Düsterhöft","original_name":"Liliane Düsterhöft","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c92162ac3a3682ece4fc9e0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Puszko","original_name":"Patrick Puszko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9215e69251410f93a0863c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2269255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mujtaba Saeed","original_name":"Mujtaba Saeed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qessKVYnLtkqPb5bTuPZctWLbxY.jpg","credit_id":"5c92152f9251410feaa80280","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2269255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mujtaba Saeed","original_name":"Mujtaba Saeed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qessKVYnLtkqPb5bTuPZctWLbxY.jpg","credit_id":"5c9215500e0a2612ef5d3fa8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269257,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lara Wittosek","original_name":"Lara Wittosek","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c921568c3a368611952fdc7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marco Grönwoldt","original_name":"Marco Grönwoldt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c92158f0e0a2613045d76f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269260,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian Langenbach","original_name":"Adrian Langenbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c92159f0e0a2612ef5d4010","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gürcan Cansever","original_name":"Gürcan Cansever","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9215b19251410f93a085d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2269258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Rühle","original_name":"Gabriel Rühle","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/zrOxDWBcmIezGkU19qb7CJ3eA43.jpg","credit_id":"5c92157fc3a368611152a4cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8170560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/knnNl0RRB7hZASQrPiOUVOF0oyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":4995,"name":"aging"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Muhr Gulf Short","release_date":"2017-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"SFF","release_date":"2019-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DIFF 2017   The Darkness is a Color","key":"w-eyd6BNwQI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-26T10:19:10.000Z","id":"5c9217309251410feda7dc45"}]}}}
