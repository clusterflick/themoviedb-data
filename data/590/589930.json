In his hands reels become complex, intelligent creations, played with a virtuosity worthy of Paganni, and which continue the traditions of a genre passed on orally. A genre which has retained its popularity, and whose giants include Skinner, Coleman, Allard. Jean Carignan tackles their repertoire, as well as reaping the harvest of his exploration of Irish and Scottish musical traditions, which has made of him an internationally renowned specialist in Celtic music. This film is also a love story between an impoverished child and his violin, and provide a unique window into a remarkable era.","popularity":0.296,"poster_path":"/zQHgAGCNL0HlUOeNeB1LLl1amqW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1975-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean Carignan, Fiddler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2273262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean Carignan","original_name":"Jean Carignan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lxvVTs22yTKiSI7Qn81Fg86ANbW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c981cb9c3a36877e63a721b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273263,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Gosselin","original_name":"Paul Gosselin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c981cc79251416b30f62616","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benoit Bernier","original_name":"Benoit Bernier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ca139580e0a265983fbcc68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léo Plamondon","original_name":"Léo Plamondon","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ca139dbc3a3687355849df1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arcade Gosselin","original_name":"Arcade Gosselin","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ca13a310e0a26598efbb928","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61dabb2a25cd850042b2d915","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2273262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean Carignan","original_name":"Jean Carignan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lxvVTs22yTKiSI7Qn81Fg86ANbW.jpg","credit_id":"5c981c839251416b3af64e95","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650083,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Larose","original_name":"Paul Larose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c981bfd925141186bf57f61","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273263,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Gosselin","original_name":"Paul Gosselin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c981c980e0a2620efc0fa26","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c981b96c3a36841b93c2a26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monique Fortier","original_name":"Monique Fortier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c981bd09251411920f55cd6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168431,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louise Carré","original_name":"Louise Carré","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5def6be96a34480012c65fd5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0073197","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zQHgAGCNL0HlUOeNeB1LLl1amqW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4721,"name":"violin"},{"id":3356,"name":"quebec"},{"id":6382,"name":"folk music"},{"id":8608,"name":"violinist"},{"id":165518,"name":"fiddle"},{"id":188684,"name":"fiddler"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1975-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jean Carignan - Hangman's Reel","key":"gT3DctGzUhI","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2007-11-24T00:03:34.000Z","id":"5d5cc4f6a3d02700170b4227"}]}}}
