A radical experience, now elevated to a symbol by the ecological movements of half of Europe.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x7abn5aYcgDFcSwmU3hIxhQoLms.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hambachers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Marziali","original_name":"Claudio Marziali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8fe5335a61e002ea9019f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonora Pigliucci","original_name":"Leonora Pigliucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8fe40c5c1ef0045fea200","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x7abn5aYcgDFcSwmU3hIxhQoLms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1199}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hambachers - Trailer","key":"b34NM8Up2h4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-04-01T10:29:10.000Z","id":"61a8fe763dc3130044b3d09e"}]}}}
