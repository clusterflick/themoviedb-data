Afterwards, it attempts to get back onto the screen but the computer has been turned off by an unseen human presence. The pencil tool finally manages to turn on the computer but when it tries to return to the software programme is no longer possible and ends up smacking onto the screen. After the credits, you can hear a sound of the screen shattering.","popularity":0.3921,"poster_path":"/3TCffhKtzxtrLfrxKhpS4PLDVvg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14801,"logo_path":"/bnlD5KJ5oSzBYbEpDkwi6w8SoBO.png","name":"Apple","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3,"logo_path":"/1TjvGVDMYsj6JBxOAkUHpPEwLf7.png","name":"Pixar","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A pencil icon from an Apple Macintosh drawing program comes to life.","title":"Pencil Test","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332949,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Potel","original_name":"Mike Potel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a910542495ab0091997f5d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332952,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nancy Tague","original_name":"Nancy Tague","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a9108c383df200647d9efb","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332950,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Tesler","original_name":"Larry Tesler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a910654a52f800643387f8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7899,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Galyn Susman","original_name":"Galyn Susman","popularity":0.1867,"profile_path":"/x7eCfF09EXtGThrf5tnr83G7qm7.jpg","credit_id":"61a910812495ab002a0f61ea","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332951,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jack Palevich","original_name":"Jack Palevich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a910744a52f800446f4933","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0406127","wikidata_id":"Q12126897","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3TCffhKtzxtrLfrxKhpS4PLDVvg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6104,"name":"computer"},{"id":4597,"name":"pencil"},{"id":10159,"name":"computer animation"},{"id":33621,"name":"desk"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1988-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
