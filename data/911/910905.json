Heated rhetoric from both sides continues to be heard in courtrooms and on the campaign trail. But while attention is often focused on the arguments, there is another story playing out in local communities. Pro-life advocates have waged a successful campaign to reduce abortions in many places throughout the country. By using state laws to regulate and limit abortion and by creating their own clinics to offer alternatives to women, they have changed the facts on the ground. FRONTLINE investigates the steady decline in the number of physicians and clinics performing abortions and focuses on local political battles in states like Mississippi, where only a single clinic performs the controversial procedure.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Abortion Clinic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1424494,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raney Aronson-Rath","original_name":"Raney Aronson-Rath","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667301a60a59ae1602a3a506","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1424494,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raney Aronson-Rath","original_name":"Raney Aronson-Rath","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66730118a1df98590555ae65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":337277,"name":"health-medical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
