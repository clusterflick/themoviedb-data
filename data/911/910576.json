To die is to rest, writes Jose Rizal, and where his poem ends, \"Ultimo\" begins. It is a black-and-white silent film, with scenes from the director's meanderings in La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) inspired by Rizal's poem, which was written a day before the hero's execution in 1896. It explores identity and nationhood as viewed through a post-colonial lens.","popularity":0.0427,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultimo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"61a7cecabe4b360045d7e55a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
