A natural affluent player of flute, Kanai, gets jealous of her would be husband. Being merely a boy of twelve years, he exclaims about his fondness for Koyel and proposes for marriage. He declares to Koyel that he would spend all his piggy bank savings to start a new family. Though laughable, the proposal is also met with appreciation from Koyel. While this happy chapter plays along, trouble brews in the horizon. Samad, a driver by profession has a routine of getting drunk and beating up his wife when he returns home after weeks of work.
