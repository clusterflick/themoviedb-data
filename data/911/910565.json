To win requires riding almost non-stop, night and day, for days on end. It is a combination of strength and sleep deprivation that only a few riders in the world can manage. Alone, unsupported and loaded down with supplies, each competitor must constantly battle mechanicals, heat exhaustion and saddle sores to get to the finish. There is no prize, no money, simply the satisfaction that comes from pushing oneself to the limit while exploring the forgotten corners of a beautiful country.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/k6GqcCr8GN9B4dm6Mp8pqu26H5M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into the Rift: The Story of the PEdALED Atlas Mountain Race","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Trees","original_name":"Nelson Trees","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61a7c4910284200092377625","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofiane Sehili","original_name":"Sofiane Sehili","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61a7c4b3fcadb4002b1ef2c2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Neal Barenblat","original_name":"Neal Barenblat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c59b383df200647b9558","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331928,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Allen Lawrence","original_name":"Allen Lawrence","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c5c6d2f5b5004529547e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brady Lawrence","original_name":"Brady Lawrence","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c56d38469a0068df0e1d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331926,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew Couch","original_name":"Matthew Couch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c587383df200647b9535","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brady Lawrence","original_name":"Brady Lawrence","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c5b1c5c1ef0094aad9cc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brady Lawrence","original_name":"Brady Lawrence","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c4641f3319002b0f49a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331931,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liam Yates","original_name":"Liam Yates","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c63c2495ab0091978c11","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenton Gilchrist","original_name":"Kenton Gilchrist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a7c625be4b360045d7da18","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13970814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1708,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k6GqcCr8GN9B4dm6Mp8pqu26H5M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Into the Rift : The Story of the PEdALED Atlas Mountain Race","key":"e5k5ayE9iqU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-20T19:00:13.000Z","id":"61a7c4450716500063b9afa7"}]}}}
