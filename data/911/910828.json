The film, created by Joan Mandell, Pea Holmquist, and Pierre Bjorklund in 1984 is believed to be the first documentary ever made in Gaza. The film features Ariel Sharon, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and soldiers on patrol \"candidly discuss[ing] their responsibilities.\"  The film follows a refugee family from the Gaza Strip who visit the site of their former village, now a Jewish town in Israel. As the grandfather and great-grandfather point out an orchard and sycamore fig that belonged to Muhammed Ayyub and Uncle Khalil, an Israeli resident appears and tells them to leave, claiming they need a permit to be there. The mother tells him that, \"We work in Jaffa and Tel Aviv and that's not forbidden,\" to which he replies, \"Here it's forbidden.\"","popularity":1.462,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":165640,"logo_path":null,"name":"HB PeÅ Holmquist Film","origin_country":""},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":28498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Garantinämnden för kort- och barnfilm","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1985-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaza Ghetto","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Binyamin Ben Eliezer","original_name":"Binyamin Ben Eliezer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61a8fe562495ab002a0f41bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yitzhak Rabin","original_name":"Yitzhak Rabin","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/eY3AEV0fkYqjCObTSP7afPFfPrM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61a8fe77be4b36006a76fc4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reuven Rozenblat","original_name":"Reuven Rozenblat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61a8fe86d2f5b50065738f08","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Sharon","original_name":"Ariel Sharon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/vH1gfLyG40jANdGTZzE1cwXCeWK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61a8fe980486380065c15cea","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","original_name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8fec81f3319002b10f43c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Mandell","original_name":"Joan Mandell","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8fee5d2f5b5002b214108","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Björklund","original_name":"Pierre Björklund","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8fef8028420002dbc1279","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","original_name":"Per-Åke Holmquist","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8ff129a64350028ac6da0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332859,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mary Khass","original_name":"Mary Khass","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8ff2902842000457dc8cc","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332860,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ur Schlonsky","original_name":"Ur Schlonsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8ff41e267de008e787354","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":267595,"name":"israeli occupation"},{"id":275377,"name":"gaza"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
