It is also about a twelve-year-old girl who resides in a slum in India, she is single-handedly destroying patriarchy and enabling change as she paves the way for equality and economic freedom in her family. She is also enabling experiences for herself and for the children in her slum community. When change transpires at the grass-root level it paves way for miracles. It is a true documentation of the day a group of Mumbai children who live in a slum embark on an adventure. The story is a metaphor for hope, manifestation and the power of dreams in ‘New India,’ and a ‘New World’. A more empathic world is possible if all of our work together in manifesting its destiny selflessly with passion and integrity.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/iOW0oKecPwvq4raWR2WNmg6YG5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blow Broadcast","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live Your Fairy Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548878,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arsala Qureishi","original_name":"Arsala Qureishi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a781eb3dc3130044b1c755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jas Sagu","original_name":"Jas Sagu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a781fd38469a0096cdc7c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iOW0oKecPwvq4raWR2WNmg6YG5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2021","release_date":"2021-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
