Thus, the universe of the acclaimed children's program 31 Minutos is transferred to the work of Cervantes in a theatrical parody for children and adults that recreates essential elements of the story, maintaining some of its most innovative aspects: the author as a character in the work, the existence of the book within the same novel, etc. The puppet version of the literary classic is quite faithful to the original text, since it preserves entire dialogues from the novel as a way of valuing its validity. It also rescues themes such as fantasy, the necessary madness or eccentricity that takes us out of everyday life and inspires us to fulfill our dreams despite the difficulties; friendship and love as values ​​worth defending tooth and nail, and humor as a trench against pedantry.","popularity":0.4829,"poster_path":"/uE2EomfekGVh8S0S5k8aEamUFz4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86971,"logo_path":"/wIUypihbVWqsJQtQCMBjZGrO1UW.png","name":"Aplaplac","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":178301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro
