These lives, captured in the streets of Rome, constitute the counter-shot for the landscape through which a fictional character wanders, adrift. After meeting a young girl in the Campo di Fiori market, a woman who has come to Rome to die, journeys through its many fountains, haunted by visions of lost innocence. Staged on locations from the Roman films of Pier Paolo Pasolini.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/jrFQYQFgp78MBFBzIRGEiXFKrgv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adrift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathy Lee Crane","original_name":"Cathy Lee Crane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/p0lx94QdW9AFk7lvtoOSFOsgx7V.jpg","credit_id":"62c60e99c1606a02d8a7205e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1570421","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jrFQYQFgp78MBFBzIRGEiXFKrgv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
