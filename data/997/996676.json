This episode gives the critic Alain Bergala complete freedom to commemorate the original Éden de La Ciotat cinema. The oldest continuously operating cinema in the world first opened as a theatre in 1889, but the very same year it also hosted its first commercial film screening, comprised of nineteen Lumière “views”. Threatened with closure in the 1980s, the cinema was reopened in 2013 after a restoration project. This luminous documentary accompanies Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne over the course of a few days in October 2021 as they walk through the Teatro Éden, the shipyard and the Palais Lumière built by Antoine Lumière, the father of Auguste and Louis. And it does not forget the legendary station from L’Arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat.","popularity":0.0903,"poster_path":"/g7YGzqMBOmV1tqCRwL4JoUay6fR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112963,"logo_path":"/ccSxSr2Kgdt6jzAjHHvDn8K3xKD.png","name":"Kolam Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eden of La Ciotat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/n5BqsP6h3VtweQAFfQz2qtd5khq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62c5d44a447f9c0051610d80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Dardenne","original_name":"Luc Dardenne","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/hfnvLjmLKQyx1ftkuC6hhHwoTtM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62c5d456b7abb50067b24296","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3614002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Louis Tixier","original_name":"Jean-Louis Tixier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62c5d45f907f260132fd2d8a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3614003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Basilio","original_name":"Florence Basilio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62c5d46c706b9f0055c63143","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Bergala","original_name":"Alain Bergala","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/AfyT9AtqBmRGLMDPKwD9OiFqIWF.jpg","credit_id":"62c5d43495665800670b6239","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3730636,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raphaël Roche","original_name":"Raphaël Roche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504bff6d1bb20150a4ee75","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":255050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joël Farges","original_name":"Joël Farges","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504bdf2a09bc00e90087cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2428501,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olga Prud’homme Farges","original_name":"Olga Prud’homme Farges","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504be76d1bb20171cbcf4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047005,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandrine Deegen","original_name":"Sandrine Deegen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504bedd7107e012d00733e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793903,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aurélien Py","original_name":"Aurélien Py","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vt7UiEAgj6ZXKb8r4i0sOTdwriP.jpg","credit_id":"64504bf4d7107e016b7d8fd4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ApM3twkzC4aeY4MXUzMB6UBWxRv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/g7YGzqMBOmV1tqCRwL4JoUay6fR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Il Cinema Ritrovato","release_date":"2022-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
