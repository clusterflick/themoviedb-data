The monologue of a killer with a shovel inspired by real maniacs, from Tsutomu Miyazaki to Seito Sakekibara. It's part of my series of films that have dissected the cinema screen, like Zetcho and Rabbit Hunting. At the time I was more aware of cinema rather than film itself, so my taste for the widescreen format was idle at times. After all, I experienced firsthand how difficult it was to produce a Cinemascope projection with an 8mm projector. All I knew was that in the 1980s, director Akira Fujiwara had shot martial arts films in cinemascope with 8mm film.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/yDVL0kG4bGPiOuVWdcxoGLVm5Uh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ecrips Of Hunting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1746777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenji Onishi","original_name":"大西健児","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/kL0hv7pNJM83XYoByGsMQQdcpb.jpg","credit_id":"62c6b44ecf62cd004e6c1f58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yDVL0kG4bGPiOuVWdcxoGLVm5Uh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
