Working outside the local tradition of making pots and “useful” objects out of clay, Seni claims that through a “gift of God” she has been able to create thousands of bizarre, magnificent creatures — clay sculptures of astonishing originality. Although the villagers don’t know quite what to make of Seni and her art, she continues to work to support her family and to satisfy her own creative urge. The film follows Seni and her husband as they prepare the materials of her art. Together they dig up the hard dirt of the land and slowly mix it with water and sand until the clay is ready to be molded (she tells by taste). While Seni does the intense work of shaping the wet clay into her truly original forms, her husband prepares the final dye bath by harvesting and soaking wild nuts in water. Finally they fire the sculptures and dye them.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/6hgDxH501pxq8nosCHRcDIwrTVN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seni's Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Haas","original_name":"Philip Haas","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/ejZkqudQcMsNTY126047kQ76xiJ.jpg","credit_id":"62c4a33f22e4803883986745","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6hgDxH501pxq8nosCHRcDIwrTVN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":665},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":997,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vPf4xkQfJU3GaezPaYBLyci4rVe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
