After this time and Bodoque has not moved a finger. Mr. Monster returns ready to see a colossal montage, and little does he know that the work is right where he left it, that is, not started. Bodoque calls his friends from 31 minutos to help him out of trouble. Along with the well-known cast of 31 minutos, he begins to improvise his version of the classic live and between acts, a choir of minstrels will perform explanatory songs of such a complicated tragedy. In 31 Minutos: Romeo and Juliet, the characters from the popular children's series will unleash an exaggeratedly free version of the Shakespearean classic, outraging the learned and confounding the ignorant.","popularity":0.2955,"poster_path":"/5gGzLeCw8ra3DG85BQBhfasGRGz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86971,"logo_path":"/wIUypihbVWqsJQtQCMBjZGrO1UW.png","name":"Aplaplac","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"31
