A few months later, while in New York, I went unannounced to the Anthology Film Archives and met Mekas there. I was 29 years old and carrying a small video camera, which was on all the time, also during our conversation in a nearby café where Mekas liked to go. Twenty years later, I came across that recording on a mini DV cassette and edited it a little, using some fragments from Mekas’ movies. The result was a raw record of the moments that I wanted to remember.
