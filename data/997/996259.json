While they are subjected to the plant’s consciousness and to each other’s presence, they perform a choreography, aligning their naked bodies with each other and with the architectural ruins. The film serves as a catalyst to discuss wider social and relational issues such as science, spirituality, psychiatry, healing, healthcare and the problems of collective depression and trauma resulting from living in the age of Late Capitalism. Becoming Plant features a specially composed soundtrack by London based electronic musician and visual artist Gaika.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/oz1a4FQYg9Qfc17FRWAU9ohbWK2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Horst Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":178440,"logo_path":null,"name":"f.eks.","origin_country":""},{"id":178441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kunsthal Rønnebæksholm","origin_country":""},{"id":178442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen City Biennale","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2022-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becoming Plant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Ndiritu","original_name":"Grace Ndiritu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c4a9cc9672ed23ceffeecb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVUfZQ0ClVL9LNeyxlIjCrIajs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oz1a4FQYg9Qfc17FRWAU9ohbWK2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
