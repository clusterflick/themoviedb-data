The film looks back at the perils faced by Armstrong, a Sri Lankan Tamil, along with his epic odyssey from conflict and violence-ridden homeland, towards far corners of the world risking death, detention and deportation over the lands and seas. The Sunshine will explore the ultimate universal question how and why people get prepared to risk everything. The movie will tell the story of human struggle and not just merely make a political statement. Director Leena Manimekalai says, The Sunshine is unique and personal because it has the autobiographical touch of her friend and writer Shobasakthi.","popularity":0.292,"poster_path":"/1PPtyKxOAWJPSNcFFLSNLpAzQ3p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16429,"logo_path":"/8VoXlyno166HSIwMilMLtmb9EBk.png","name":"Dream Warrior Pictures","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sunshine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonythasan Jesuthasan","original_name":"Antonythasan Jesuthasan","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/awXSDRRPXXVBB1YRy5mtpC49Ooy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62c66339d266a200566b701c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339516,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"S.
