This element in the script sparks off a fanciful wandering strewn with unexpected meetings. First with Kitagawa, thanks to whom Sakaguchi landed the job. Then with a seamstress, and then with Yoshino, with whom a half-hearted romance emerges. Thus the narrative unfolds, in halts and swerves, espousing unexpected meetings, and offering the strolling character an opportunity for displacements from one place to the next. The deserted town has come to a standstill - the shooting took place during the lockdown - and this acts as a metaphor for the idleness of the characters. GARDEN SANDBOX is light and nimble, whereas its main character hasa limp. Her demeanour and her stiff body exude a peculiar quality, somewhat comically at odds with the setting.","popularity":0.0772,"poster_path":"/yAZDWYLVoekpzfPuak22gNs3LWb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178414,"logo_path":null,"name":"KINOKOYA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garden Sandbox","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"NIWA NO SUNABA","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"にわのすなば","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"にわのすなば GARDEN SANDBOX","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marino Kawashima","original_name":"Marino Kawashima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sakaguchi","credit_id":"62c74967f74f5f00508dc9dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuki Niiya","original_name":"Kazuki Niiya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Kitagawa","credit_id":"62c7496fc68b69004f73bced","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1500438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukino Murakami","original_name":"Yukino Murakami","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/bmkWcqFfPNV6quyxTgbsptKifQh.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Yoshino","credit_id":"62c7497ba0b6b50726dbc107","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yukinori Kurokawa","original_name":"Yukinori Kurokawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c74920b7abb5036bedb1f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644822,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yasutaka Watanabe","original_name":"Yasutaka Watanabe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c749462cde98006ab95e3c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600835,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kunihiko Ukai","original_name":"Kunihiko Ukai","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lpzOMJuBuxRuEh0iAV5FFIC8hVg.jpg","credit_id":"62c7494fa0b6b50726dbc0f1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gen Takahashi","original_name":"Gen Takahashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c7495c907f260134d3899b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615597,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Emi Kobayashi","original_name":"Emi Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648889946f8d9500afde8aa1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260700,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ikuhiro Yamagata","original_name":"Ikuhiro Yamagata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648889a56f8d95011f23967a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yukinori Kurokawa","original_name":"Yukinori Kurokawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648889add2b20900ad3e2fec","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21292198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wg7SyQiEcquhelzguyrvFqAz15Z.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/eAJRQ5FLMzmr1IYEmELjG8k5tBh.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":638},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1058,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/3irYg37SGmOCSEliX3e9nX3p8tv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2116,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/7cxFx5tUQ5pnxGDomJT0N2Wo54I.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1349,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yAZDWYLVoekpzfPuak22gNs3LWb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Silvestre Longas 2023 | Trailer | Garden Sandbox","key":"2syT3pvzIOc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-17T13:55:26.000Z","id":"65288a701f3e6000c58818bd"}]}}}
