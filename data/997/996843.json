The text is excerpted from Brian Massumi's essay 'Fear (The Spectrum Said),' which discusses the Bush Administration's terror alert color-coding system as a method to modulate public affect via media representation. Aimed ultimately at producing a 'startle without a scare,' the Department of Homeland Security's terror alert system is framed as a governmental attempt to install a self-perpetuating, irrational fear mechanism in the public psyche. The insertion of a soundtrack by Modeselektor with uncanny vocals from Paul St. Hilaire (remixed by Dabrye) seeks to double (ghost) and thereby underline the point of Massumi's complex media textual analysis.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evil.12.edit.b (fear, spectra & fake emotion)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Cokes","original_name":"Tony Cokes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c664f3a0b6b5005f70761e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
