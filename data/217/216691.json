Ernie Anderson, who played Cleveland's counter-culture media celebrity Ghoulardi, hosted WJW-TV's late-night horror movies from 1963 to 1966 and was an incredible influence locally. The one-hour production premiered on Western Reserve PBS in 2009. It earned two Emmy Awards, for directing and editing for producer Phil Hoffman. Turn Blue is the work of award-winning producer/director Phil Hoffman, Ed.D., who also teaches radio and television courses at The University of Akron. It is the latest in a series of local history productions that Hoffman has created in cooperation with Western Reserve Public Media. The program has also aired on WGTE Public Media in Northeast Ohio.","popularity":0.1758,"poster_path":"/s4q3Jxw9IQkcMHiw9tbcn2zspoO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turn Blue: The Short Life of Ghoulardi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Anderson","original_name":"Ernie Anderson","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ghoulardi, Himself","credit_id":"646d05a2a5046e01474ebd71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Schodowski","original_name":"Chuck Schodowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f5e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Heldenfels","original_name":"Rich Heldenfels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f5e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Feran","original_name":"Tom Feran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f5ed","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201240,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Phil Hoffman","original_name":"Phil Hoffman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f5dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201239,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Hoffman","original_name":"Phil Hoffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f5d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1600436,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Wendt","original_name":"Michael Wendt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a677249251417442002e7c","department":"Crew","job":"Set Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jTY420C2XKxRdoJpwWO93RJq2sA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f5W72WStPOkUzfbxOCPZ2IJgcTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s4q3Jxw9IQkcMHiw9tbcn2zspoO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cWHqhRt7ExEhu7vt7fD0R6YMicI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
