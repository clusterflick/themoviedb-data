Celia, once the darling of Philippine opera, and Gaspar, a distinguished ex-congressman, lacked the shrewdness to maintain their once elegant status.  Saddled with a failed marriage, a vanishing career and mounting debt, Celia sold her share of their house to Gaspar, now bedridden.  She managed to stay for free in exchange for being Gaspar’s caregiver.  Gaspar loves listening to Celia’s arias.  This idyllic arrangement is shattered when he slips into a coma.  His daughter, Raquel, comes home from the US, determined to sell the house to salvage her own economic woes abroad.  This signals Celia’s impending homelessness.  With only a few heirlooms to sell, she is at her wits’ end.  A fervent believer of the Sto. Nino, she hopes for a miracle.  She dresses up her grandson, Antony, in Sto. Nino robes to prepare him for the coming fiesta.","popularity":0.5024,"poster_path":"/t9VtLHqYbucGCOYD9PQ85jTY7yJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya
