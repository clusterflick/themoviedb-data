In San's heroic daydreams, a cool father leads him into modern Quichote exploits, yet even those tend to turn sour. Slipping, like his grades, into rebellion and school incidents, San, who just went on a fugue, becomes the prime suspect after a schoolgirl turned novice drug slut has been beaten into a coma. The clueless police and irresponsible school staff will probably blame San. Her friend, a regular drug harlot, is the worried-sick father's only lead to find San and the truth, and shamelessly exploits that.","popularity":0.2626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quixote's Island","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joke Devynck","original_name":"Joke Devynck","popularity":0.2699,"profile_path":"/mDubm3wsiD6jMS8y66msTsWI19g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210a8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeroen Willems","original_name":"Jeroen Willems","popularity":0.1245,"profile_path":"/czHYyHIbuOBrL5pn2TNe64jkL1z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210a8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiemen van Haver","original_name":"Tiemen van Haver","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210a93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1201601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Verheyden","original_name":"Christine Verheyden","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/dm2kjEEYfaWz5bl0SQnAmKIeoK3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210a97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maarten Claeyssens","original_name":"Maarten Claeyssens","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/t2Tpda6xSR19PgSDMzqwp10hHgp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210a9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annick Christiaens","original_name":"Annick Christiaens","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/5wPLs9wCsRbh9nuxiXeq89pZDwC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210aa3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1035836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Schoeters","original_name":"Ellen Schoeters","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/sqb4lfUHHZVBLCBiYaPzMKqCxQl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210aab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1259086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Lesage","original_name":"Günther Lesage","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/yBWWjg2M9f8hHvbshWCEVtQjH9Q.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6123ca43a1d332002bf0de71","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jakob Beks","original_name":"Jakob Beks","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/jQkFJFrYVOzD9FBMsVSk6uvATPm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"659d6ac5ca4f67014ba8b850","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Volckaert","original_name":"Didier Volckaert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a368484e210ab1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4549651,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Chris Lievens","original_name":"Chris Lievens","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d61cafe6d3cc017bc0afa8","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1568340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
