The place takes a humanistic approach to reform and there are no armed guards, no lockups and no uniforms. The underlying philosophy is that if these things are not there, the prisoners will not want to escape, and will instead accept their punishment. A new inmate arrives and soon accustoms himself to the new idea. The story includes the Oscar nominated song Unchained Melody.","popularity":0.853,"poster_path":"/xfZzlqi3S8R41E4Hi3TaFH9lOxg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hall Bartlett Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
