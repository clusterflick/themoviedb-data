While touching on significant moments in Brakhage’s biography, the film celebrates Brakhage’s visionary genius, and explores the extraordinary artistic possibilities of cinema, a medium mostly known only for its commercial applications in the form of narratives, cartoons, documentaries, and advertising. BRAKHAGE combines excerpts from Brakhage’s films and films of other avant-garde filmmakers (eg, George Kuchar, Jonas Mekas, Willie Varela, Bruce Elder, and others); interviews with Brakhage, his friends, family, colleagues, and critics; archival footage of Brakhage spanning the past thirty-five years; and location shooting in Boulder, Colorado and New York.","popularity":0.4839,"poster_path":"/iyF3KisvGTWzl1wx6ruO1ieMe1x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sphinx Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brakhage","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f715","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1013947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Wodening","original_name":"Jane Wodening","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/pWLBcc7Tn3RgUyN8fXGf8YoKmHq.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59d69b80c3a3681922000651","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilyn Brakhage","original_name":"Marilyn Brakhage","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59d67fd89251413836000770","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neowyn Brakhage","original_name":"Neowyn Brakhage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d04e72b0e0a260b0ace77ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2279196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bearthm Brakhage","original_name":"Bearthm Brakhage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/A8Mx5tPRGp3AMpeqYMyThflSFUw.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d04e73b0e0a267f2fcac541","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Aronson","original_name":"Jerry Aronson","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f719","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
