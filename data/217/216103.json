But he soon trades the Alsatian landscape for higher altitudes and more emotional territory: a reunion with his estranged wife Natalie and their son Noah in the Swiss Alps. Like his literary counterpart, the modern-day Lenz follows the Romantic motto: Genius writes its own rules. Against a background of kitsch global tourism - provided by the authentic Zermatt locations - Thomas Imbach's Lenz portrays an unconventional family and a man struggling between euphoria and desperation.","popularity":0.1543,"poster_path":"/zn5SSlAonBbHUZ8apyDAk7tA8vd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schweizer Fernsehen
