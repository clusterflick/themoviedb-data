One of the greatest voices of the 20th Century, her renditions of songs by Harold Arlen, Leonard Bernstein, Johnny Burke, the Gershwins and Stephen Sondheim are pure diva magic. These three performances demonstrate why Sarah Vaughan is invariably mentioned in the same breath as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday.","popularity":0.1337,"poster_path":"/30LOrM8OSttZ97jUXHNrPOtkdcb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170842,"logo_path":null,"name":"jazz icons","origin_country":""},{"id":161731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reelin in the Years Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Icons: Sarah Vaughan: Live in '58 & '64","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Vaughan","original_name":"Sarah Vaughan","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/wkP3XXCKo8MGOtIYdBVkaIuNmFs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fd61be107291c00427422d4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2432541,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Peck","original_name":"David Peck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621e4b23058224004291be16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1473103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Galloway","original_name":"Phillip Galloway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621e4b3b5c3247001ca54ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1473104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Gulotta","original_name":"Tom Gulotta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621e4b513acd200042f88174","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5vnVng59wRw6Yp46dzyh2LE0SkK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/30LOrM8OSttZ97jUXHNrPOtkdcb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3017,"name":"jazz singer or musician"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
