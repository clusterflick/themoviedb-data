In 1980, Loreen Graham is on a school outing to the Salem Witch Museum when a wax figure of a man from 1692 comes to life and accosts her. It seems that she may be the reincarnation of Ann, who had accused the man's 5-year-old daughter of witchcraft and the girl is scheduled to be burned at the stake. Loreen must fight against Ann's possession and confront the corrupt 17th century minister consorting with Ann to falsely accuse people of witchcraft.","popularity":1.2364,"poster_path":"/qmMaHJxlcOG7ZByHbO3DPR2KUVD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alan Landsburg Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What's Gotten Into Loreen?","title":"Burned at the Stake","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Testemunha do Diabo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"The coming (Viaje a traves del tiempo)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Tulo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"The Coming","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Coming","type":"poster title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Nacht des Hexenjägers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":182515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Swift","original_name":"Susan Swift","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/1CZQRWsOrGVWzWsd3DOfTD9i3gf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Loreen Graham / Ann Putnam","credit_id":"54a5555f925141236b00bb24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Salmi","original_name":"Albert Salmi","popularity":0.4188,"profile_path":"/oSoCqsuq2QfM7tlBj6awXVJhgv5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Capt.
