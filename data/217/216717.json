John Lydon returns as Johnny Rotten, with two-tone hair, red shorts, and no letup from the famous raw, shouted vocals with which he helped invent UK punk in the 1970’s. Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook blast out the music in the Pistols’ trademark fast, tight, loud style, reviving a host of Sex Pistols favourites.  While the great punk-rock moment that the Sex Pistols created and owned in the mid-1970’s was brief and fleeting, this concert shows that punk rock – and the band that made it famous – will never die. A searing evening of wild music.","popularity":1.1392,"poster_path":"/aIa0JWst2j6cHJ4QwR2qoFaRmKS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex Pistols: Live at Budokan","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lydon","original_name":"John Lydon","popularity":0.3712,"profile_path":"/iYVqtqbSngil3AoaqEYlNp68fbg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Johnny Rotton (Himself)","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f69f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Vicious","original_name":"Sid Vicious","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/s5dk16sAKA4lR3zruISthoSbTEj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f6a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Jones","original_name":"Steve Jones","popularity":0.1648,"profile_path":"/fcTJSxOVST1BMn0AyKuO0qkeR6B.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f6a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Cook","original_name":"Paul Cook","popularity":0.1688,"profile_path":"/k1z00YC9PdhGgLM1uj7LjT1fBni.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f6ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Matlock","original_name":"Glen Matlock","popularity":0.1934,"profile_path":"/uK3bDZJwZtEPJCzVUXiUofW0mIR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1fc3a368484e20f6af","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aIa0JWst2j6cHJ4QwR2qoFaRmKS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":162066,"name":"rock concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sex Pistols - Anarchy in the U.K - Live 16.11.1996 - Budokan Hall, Tokyo, Japan","key":"tIeKhqScMOE","published_at":"2007-05-16T21:43:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec718c3a368544800b0aa"}]}}}
