With the help of Wendy, Javier's transvestite brother, they rob a part of the shipment and escape from the police. Moulded by loneliness, indifference and a lack of communication, Nora, Javier and Wendy are three youths with no future who move on the outer rim of society and are helpless in the face of a corrupt power. They hide in El Marquesado, a seaside resort built by the military on dynamited cliffs where Rodolfo and Mercedes, Javier and Wendy's parents, survive by rustling pigs and cows from neighbouring farms. The conflicts and tensions in this marginal family resurface as they are reunited in this remote place with a sinister past.","popularity":0.149,"poster_path":"/xFCk6QzrWtjWdDZGZFCRFWO2cMZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2003-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Southern Cross","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3353449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Letizia Lestido","original_name":"Letizia Lestido","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nora","credit_id":"61c0900b13af5f00631466b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Suardi","original_name":"Luciano Suardi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/eWSvZ6y6IG6vpwrZ6FwSUMbxW8e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Javier","credit_id":"61c09015e24b93001caf21b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":677695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Baylé","original_name":"Silvia Baylé","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/hXfx8zfDLvH2m8hVqDaGUf5GfKa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mercedes","credit_id":"61c0906785b1050061e555ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":946795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Alegre","original_name":"Oscar Alegre","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/jhAnxny4y72UlyBZp1iycIrQrkd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"\"Negro\"","credit_id":"61c0907bf29d660041ca5401","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Humberto Tortonese","original_name":"Humberto Tortonese","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Wendy","credit_id":"61c09024c4ad59001c448567","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":992951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Paolucci","original_name":"Mario Paolucci","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Rodolfo","credit_id":"61c0904e1f3319008d4d672a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3893718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Roberti","original_name":"Bruno Roberti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d6a9fbd051d9010209fd7f","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Reyero","original_name":"Pablo Reyero","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e16c3a368484e20d665","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Fontán","original_name":"Gustavo Fontán","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/6MGwcS3YgcLuzDGbqeinPAn5gql.jpg","credit_id":"61c08fd1d144430092da6daf","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61711,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jorge Goldenberg","original_name":"Jorge Goldenberg","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/tkjbXdKsGyXdLSQO3CzLQ4DAAOE.jpg","credit_id":"61c08fe00443c9006009f7f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Reyero","original_name":"Pablo Reyero","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c08fec2da84600411db1b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0321862","wikidata_id":"Q7765569","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4vfyHRLAb0vAgY4UD39TBjpNRNx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jdZOiZuBw3zwVdTuzgkC9QXW84A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xFCk6QzrWtjWdDZGZFCRFWO2cMZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
