He unsuccessfully tries to adapt to the modern Russian savage life. The world around him lives by rules dictated by the black market and Chechen wars. It is a cruel and unjust world, where you can survive only with a bunch of stolen dollars instead of brains. For a young Russian, money is a symbol of power and strength. Even the new state ideology feeds on blood oil dollars. In Russia there is no more room for dreams. This is the era of anti-utopia.","popularity":0.0939,"poster_path":"/q2kWccRWhuuQ88J77oTVka1ESCP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2000-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"100% TERROR","title":"Bastards","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vyblyadky","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Lapteva","original_name":"Elena Lapteva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a368484e20e18f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Egipetskii Mag","original_name":"Egipetskii Mag","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a368484e20e193","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3401921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David D'Agostino","original_name":"David D'Agostino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61f391fbdf294500e31da0eb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Mavromatti","original_name":"Олег Мавроматти","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/jRMCF28csWqxp81CvXsJzi9mGez.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a368484e20e18b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3741833,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"DJ Hlam","original_name":"DJ Hlam","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643782f181a7fc00be4562fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Mavromatti","original_name":"Олег Мавроматти","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/jRMCF28csWqxp81CvXsJzi9mGez.jpg","credit_id":"5f12c17a78570e003254fcc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Mavromatti","original_name":"Олег Мавроматти","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/jRMCF28csWqxp81CvXsJzi9mGez.jpg","credit_id":"5f12c1861d78f2003320e2c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2788932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q2kWccRWhuuQ88J77oTVka1ESCP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/excocmFLWBJrKTdnHZ7EwG6L3XT.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Dreamcatcher Festival)","release_date":"2000-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
