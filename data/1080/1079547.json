Images of women performing draw connections between latent stories of water wells and communal rituals associated with disappearance, mourning and death. The only narration in the film is a song, which is sung by Palestinian singer Maya Khaldi. Its lyrics are a collage of different folk tales.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/i1CsIv2CfLFj5gS5wZB5EF7ODjS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2021-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Songs Were Ready for All Wars to Come","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3894542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noor Abed","original_name":"Noor Abed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d4ac68c15b5500f0b6781e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32857606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ud6fel8uUc3GPM7UUk54BjUCkE5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2402}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i1CsIv2CfLFj5gS5wZB5EF7ODjS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":803,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lzqBvpkqPyCNktuxJYP75Jp7onw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Exhibition at Ikon Gallery (Birmingham)","release_date":"2021-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
