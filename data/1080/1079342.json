For Lito, his family, and millions of other urban slum dwellers across the city, a hard lockdown means no work. No work means no food. Hungry citizens take to the streets in protest.  The president orders the police and military to shoot anyone making trouble. Curfews are imposed and arrests are made. Aid arrives but it is not enough.  As the restrictions continue throughout 2020, Lito navigates a daily struggle to save his family - from hunger and the pandemic.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/pMtMwDbjgDDEmJw5gojOdyF9o7a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Al Jazeera English","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One of the Longest COVID Lockdowns","title":"Manila Lockdown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3893603,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonvic Lorenzo Digma","original_name":"Jonvic Lorenzo Digma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d405b2f14dad00cebcb3e9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ditsi Carolino","original_name":"Ditsi Carolino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/oUJHBcZPEO8ADpU0Xo5ZtOLLlTs.jpg","credit_id":"63d4059a4581990084c11d44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2804115,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Doy Ongleo","original_name":"Doy Ongleo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d405f5c8a5ac0080e19a5d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742009,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Gazmend Nela","original_name":"Gazmend Nela","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d40614d9f4a60081050798","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lawrence S.
