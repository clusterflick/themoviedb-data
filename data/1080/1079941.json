From the sky, the Cold War was waged in earnest - with cameras, aerial canons and rockets. There were countless weapons launched, prisoners taken and fatalities suffered. During the secret aerial war the superpowers forced patently western aircraft into Soviet airspace; Western Germany was a sort of base for America's espionage activities. The film discloses a multitude of heretofore unknown actions, elucidated by impressive, often emotional commentary by the actual participants. The contemporary witnesses discuss operations including the dropping of agents during night flights, and top-secret actions undertaken to detect potential bases for nuclear attacks.","popularity":0.355,"poster_path":"/3pwGWGqkWcdnhNf1Rf8OdNswr4W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ilona Grundmann Filmproduction","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":84339,"logo_path":"/xHTkcQihsN49kgVZNWEHT4omGym.png","name":"ZDF Enterprises","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shot down over the Soviet Union","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Tilman","original_name":"Alex Tilman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5b35922df2e00a0d96df5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fatima Almeida","original_name":"Fatima Almeida","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5b37122df2e008cc81ebd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felisberto Araujo","original_name":"Felisberto Araujo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5b38720e6a500890c7473","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Blais","original_name":"Isabelle Blais","popularity":0.1906,"profile_path":"/mHAGtfceogfaktpMkiLOuYMoS61.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5b55b955c65008c79f451","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":272408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damien Garvey","original_name":"Damien Garvey","popularity":0.3986,"profile_path":"/jLVN1BX9d8H7ubfRvve8pxtwBGK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5b5813dc313008231608e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wenham","original_name":"David Wenham","popularity":1.2785,"profile_path":"/F7CWSqUE75HtrcdqIQ7UMZ9aTX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5b59620e6a5007ffce28e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1609249,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dirk Pohlmann","original_name":"Dirk Pohlmann","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/qkAYivWMtZoSNC1WEeqZ3Anwoat.jpg","credit_id":"63d5b3a9c15b55008e435993","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202580,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivan Minov","original_name":"Ivan Minov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d5b3d112b10e0093e7b373","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2920150,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Reichelt","original_name":"Georg Reichelt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d5b3e622df2e00b208b131","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAcP4zsPWwyedAMuYjcu8La4o2r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3pwGWGqkWcdnhNf1Rf8OdNswr4W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
