Sophie arrives home from 10 hours of facial feminization surgery in a haze of pain and anesthesia. Waiting for her are Morgan, her queer actor girlfriend, and Randy, her country singer brother â€“ both just starting to get to know each other. As Sophie recovers, Morgan and Randy unite against a tragically unhelpful home nurse Donna, their common enemy on a difficult night made bearable with humor, love, music, and weed.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/gSCYR2AgNU98OLC9ZzRMemcqpOd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Funny Face","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krista Fatka","original_name":"Krista Fatka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63d555fa20e6a500bc004c16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015613,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jude Harris","original_name":"Jude Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63d55602c15b550079fa8558","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Harrison","original_name":"Charlie Harrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5561222df2e00a0d95250","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1218767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marieve Herington","original_name":"Marieve Herington","popularity":0.3832,"profile_path":"/hahOfW8PG20pTXtNF8FtZd5pqd4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63d5561a20e6a5007b00a13c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015613,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jude Harris","original_name":"Jude Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d555de955c6500a0ea543a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26179986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gSCYR2AgNU98OLC9ZzRMemcqpOd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
