A viral pandemic, where the country has gone into complete lockdown. Grieving the loss of his love in isolation and unable to bury her body, we follow his downward spiral into chaos as other powers deem to erase his memory of a past turning him back into a killing machine for the next campaign. Will he falter his memories and become a weapon yet again or will true love conquer the machine? Project Summer glistens in 80's reminiscence under a dystopian noir veil with a kick ass soundtrack which plays homage to 80's John Carpenter synth sounds and beautiful dark film grain visuals.","popularity":0.1277,"poster_path":"/1AnthAZbqMcsXAzseb0g2tnTu5u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Project Summer","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20562058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2220,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1AnthAZbqMcsXAzseb0g2tnTu5u.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1480}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
