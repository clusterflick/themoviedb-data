Today, researchers are exploring the exceptional resistance of these archaic organisms. British ecologists have even resurrected a \"zombie\" moss that has been trapped in the permafrost for 1,500 years. Associated with decay and disliked in Europe, mosses are deified in Japan. With 25,000 species worldwide, bryophytes - their scientific name - are the seat of real ecosystems, and can develop in inhospitable landscapes, through an extravagant reproduction cycle.","popularity":0.7893,"poster_path":"/17Z3ZXRTDCHduuixjoMlyTOAKev.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18740,"logo_path":"/11dLmhNuO6Pgd8tSDvktsOkP94R.png","name":"Zadig
