Terrified at what she may have done, she runs. Writer / director Ruth Paxton has made a disturbing journey into her own recurring nightmares. An episodic series of states of mind, the film contains realistic, symbolic and surrealistic elements. Her protagonist is fleeing the truth, dreading that she may have revealed her transgressions. Pleasant memories and alcohol temporarily block out the furies, but these fleeting moments of freedom and ease are cut brutally short by the relentless pursuit of her guilty demons. Ruth Paxton has combined narrative and experimentation to produce a film that is both visually stylistic and dramatically compelling, depicting the shredding of a conscience experienced at an intensity that is beyond words.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Wanted To Be Burnt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2206520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Paxton","original_name":"Ruth Paxton","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2faf85a07f50082f3a695","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1377784","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
