Catapulted to worldwide notoriety in 1999 by The Ninth Hour, a sculpture of Pope John Paul II toppled by a meteorite, Maurizio Cattelan's work has bordered on criminal activity (breaking into a gallery and stealing another artist's work) and regularly defies good taste - Him features Hitler in prayer and sold earlier this year for a whopping Â£12,000,000. Building his career on evasion, trickery and subversion, Cattelan is perhaps not the most reliable of interviewees, but ex-girlfriends, family members, collectors and dealers build a compelling and intimate portrait of an enigmatic figure. Bold, witty and playful as a Cattelan work itself, is this film really all it seems?","popularity":0.1142,"poster_path":"/cgDN7MY0bDwxNeG7KtuLaN0oasv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art World's Prankster: Maurizio Cattelan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d2f8a7a410c811e9befc04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314918,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maurizio Cattelan","original_name":"Maurizio Cattelan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6686bdbdb1bf09b3fd5ec0a5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599129,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maura Axelrod","original_name":"Maura Axelrod","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f8c3e72fe8007ca45f68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8708966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cgDN7MY0bDwxNeG7KtuLaN0oasv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
