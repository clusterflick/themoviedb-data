The movement, initiated by Paul-Émile Borduas, is explained by the artists themselves when narrator Bruce Ruddick drops in at their cooperative studio. The film also captures painter Paterson Ewen at his home and joins the crowd at L'Échouerie, the artists' rendezvous spot. Dr. Robert Hubbard, chief curator of the National Gallery of Canada, comments on non-objective art in general and automatism in particular.","popularity":0.5481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1954-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artist in Montreal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruce Ruddick","original_name":"Bruce Ruddick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63d3090f031a1d0079d5960e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1623874,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Mayerovitch","original_name":"David Mayerovitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d308e85a07f50082f3ab17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892281,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gwen Barnhill","original_name":"Gwen Barnhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d308f2cb71b80085ddf65b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Anderson","original_name":"Robert Anderson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d308fecb71b80085ddf661","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Palardy","original_name":"Jean Palardy","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d308b5a410c811e9bf01a1","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782827,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"E.C.H.
