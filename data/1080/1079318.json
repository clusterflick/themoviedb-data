In this documentary, Serge Lama reveals himself to Mireille Dumas as he had never done before. The artist comes back on the important moments of his life. He talks about love, about the women he has sung to throughout his career, about his possessive and tyrannical mother, about his father, an operetta singer who became a beer merchant out of necessity, and who he would like to avenge at all costs by shining on the stage of the Olympia. He also tells of the pain of having lost his first love in a terrible accident.","popularity":0.2077,"poster_path":"/uTcLxuI4AKdMQGphOPgQadfRgLb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1524,"logo_path":null,"name":"DD Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serge Lama, la vie à la folie","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Lama","original_name":"Serge Lama","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/nCWApYodIMTr7a8Tfk1On5l7RLa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6652684d597429e88e7f3b08","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2002200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mireille Dumas","original_name":"Mireille Dumas","popularity":0.2829,"profile_path":"/1OcZsaYQ4L5UEQEsCjYd2r8x5ay.jpg","credit_id":"63d3fa5b4581990084c11906","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vBm3qtC5qvWYYRBlhVpKEoiU6Yb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oWIKNte4C0CtuvNE5QihgQzwe42.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uTcLxuI4AKdMQGphOPgQadfRgLb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qFQ6j5jM83s5HYC7B27VovYTs9r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2032,"name":"pop singer"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
