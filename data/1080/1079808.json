Its exploration into Native American history also takes a hard and detailed look at President Ulysses S. Grant's Peace Policy of 1873, which was, in effect, a \"convert to Episcopalianism or starve\" edict put forth by the American government in direct violation of its Constitution. The devastation it had on the values of the people affected were dramatic and extremely long-lasting. Grant's policy was finally ended over 100 years later by the Freedom of American Indian Religions Act in 1978.  Interlaced with extraordinarily candid interviews, this documentary presents an insider's perspective of how the Dakota and Lakota were estranged from their religious beliefs and their long-standing traditions.","popularity":1.364,"poster_path":"/46IYG9EL6R4lwDO2RKozuJC83jH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sound View Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Will Burry The Dead?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fr Lyle Noisy Hawk","original_name":"Fr Lyle Noisy Hawk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55d5d22df2e008cc802c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reverand Sydney Byrd","original_name":"Reverand Sydney Byrd","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55d8ac15b5500d088a86b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Zephier","original_name":"Clark Zephier","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55dae12b10e007fdabd9a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Father Webster Two Hawk","original_name":"Father Webster Two Hawk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55dd220e6a500d5435d6d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Father Robert Two Bulls","original_name":"Father Robert Two Bulls","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55dff3dc313009def6f1a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reverend Terry Star","original_name":"Reverend Terry Star","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55e21c15b55008e433e4c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tilda St. Pierre","original_name":"Tilda St. Pierre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63d55e3f3dc31300864a7642","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Father Daniel Makes Good","original_name":"Father Daniel Makes Good","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55e5a955c6500a0ea574d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Respects Nothing","original_name":"Doris Respects Nothing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63d55e7d20e6a5009d22c583","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Lebeaux","original_name":"Jerome Lebeaux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d55eab22df2e00df3ce519","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella Iron Cloud","original_name":"Stella Iron Cloud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63d5600922df2e00b208995f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve","original_name":"Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63d5601f12b10e0093e79752","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tripp Hunt","original_name":"Tripp Hunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d5604b3dc31300864a76e5","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Metcalf","original_name":"Don Metcalf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d5606922df2e00df3ce59e","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rt.
