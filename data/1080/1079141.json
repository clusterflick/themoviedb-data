The surface knowledge of random teenage students was expressed and used in disseminating information about the current issues inclined to the climate crisis. The misconception that the youth are insensible about the alarming change in climate was also debunked. The film explains the significance of the environment in our lives. It principally aims to inform, educate, and raise consciousness about the necessity of communicating climate change. It tells us the narratives of the mechanisms of how climate change progressed throughout history and how it drastically changed the earthâ€™s landscape.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/8YtcsaH9ZlzIzm0K2Bo0DXB1duv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3C's: Communicating Climate Change","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaycee Malingcon","original_name":"Kaycee Malingcon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63d34bfdcb71b80085de2631","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Geoshua Ilao","original_name":"Carl Geoshua Ilao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63d34c065a07f5009e982474","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892605,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marvin J.
