Four large projections encircle the viewer, who is transported deep into the rainforest by images and sounds of buzzing insects, singing birds and raindrops falling on vegetation. They seem to emphasise the forest as a sublime, untouched, almost paradise-like space â€“ an illusion that is dissolved when suddenly huge trees start, one after another, to collapse into the tangle of green without a trace of human involvement.","popularity":0.0914,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Rosefeldt","original_name":"Julian Rosefeldt","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/hMsWR51LkNLHfo86qNk27gC0brX.jpg","credit_id":"6393384ed7fbda00a50452d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
