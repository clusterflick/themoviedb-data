The film departs from the port of Rotterdam and deals with loss, distance, death, and the undead. In 2020, the blast at the port of Beirut created a torsion in time. Diana narrates this experience from different perspectives. Port workers narrate their direct exposure to trauma and loss, while the filmmaker narrates her relationship to them, and how the disaster cannot be contained through a screen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disaster Cannot Be Contained","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3823739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Al-Halabi","original_name":"Diana Al-Halabi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6393aeceba480200888d9637","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.the961.com/al-halabi-film-screening-netherlands/","release_date":"2022-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
