It consists of a very targeted protest which contests the present dialogue in the struggle against AIDS. Due to the small number of participants it is important that everyone remains loyal to their spokesperson. The success of the \"zap\" depends on a contrast between the calmness and stubbornness of the spokesperson, and the \"latent violence\" of the group. \"From \"Act Up\" Paris we have become familiar with their actions which often involved the media... In \"Act Up\" Paris, I know some militants, either as friend or from having gone with them to several take-overs at protest marches. This film is a chronicle of 2 weeks spent with some of them\".","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/ll4FUYVAMpKyHuK2BuHESL2zXQ4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ZAP (Act Up Paris, été 95)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3594494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Martet","original_name":"Christophe Martet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Christophe Martet","credit_id":"639370c5e19de900a2dda53f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Martorana","original_name":"Vincent Martorana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6393701a283ed900b09716ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425141,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Jacques Mréjen","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Mréjen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639370f3cee2f600e27c33bb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3823322,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Emmanuelle de la Morandière","original_name":"Emmanuelle de la Morandière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63937142f04d0100d1d18040","department":"Crew","job":"Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2313837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Garnier","original_name":"Michael Garnier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63937103ba480200a1b64cff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ll4FUYVAMpKyHuK2BuHESL2zXQ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
