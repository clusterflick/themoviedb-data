McAllan assumes that his adversary died in the process. When a gang of rogue robbers board the train, McAllan's life doesn't seem worth a damn anymore. But then, almost out of nowhere, his faithful servant Lubzang appears and saves his master's life at the last moment. Malatti, also on board, falls into the clutches of the gang and is sent to Tibet by the sinister fellowsabducted to be offered as a sacrifice to the goddess Bhawani. However, a kind-hearted member of the gang of robbers takes pity on her and helps the exotic beauty to escape. A little later, Malatti meets Lubzang, who has meanwhile broken away from his master McAllan. He takes her with him.","popularity":0.1402,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Decla-Bioscop","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1921-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Jagd nach dem Tode - 3.
