A group of teenagers from a small city named Hidden Oaks Georgia, go searching for Halloween activities. James (Team-Captain and Preacher's Kid) and his closest teammates soon find out about a mysterious place called the 7 Churches. According to the small-town rumor, during the year only 4 churches appear; but only in the month of October, all 7 churches appear. A group of the schools most popular girls overhear them agree to accompany them to the 7 Churches. With both excitement and fear looming in the forefront of their minds, these prideful boys must rise to the challenge in hopes of impressing these girls. Only after their arrival on the church-grounds, do they fully understand the true horrors that lie within their midst. Will the group be able to avoid the snares of the 7 Churches and return home safely?","popularity":0.1271,"poster_path":"/1qZExceDaZP9qBue5Nb4pMOhplB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 Churches","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ponzo Houdini","original_name":"Ponzo Houdini","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hostage","credit_id":"657766e2ec8a4300c33a10c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duby Maduegbunam","original_name":"Duby Maduegbunam","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"James","credit_id":"657766e99451e70fec7ff8b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Monford","original_name":"Rob Monford","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Officer Rob","credit_id":"657766f14bfa5400c409f009","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3045136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terrance Sims","original_name":"Terrance Sims","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Trell","credit_id":"65776702bbe1dd00fe2c0108","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Spears","original_name":"Kevin Spears","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cody","credit_id":"65776712bbe1dd00c40d00bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wyllow Trawick","original_name":"Wyllow Trawick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Young Chanel","credit_id":"6577671aaf58cb0141feb65f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chyna Willis","original_name":"Chyna Willis","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jessica","credit_id":"6577672189d97f011dcd589e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425013,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kay Clark","original_name":"Kay Clark","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577675620ecaf00ad8614fc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Spears","original_name":"Kevin Spears","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65776768a1d33200febd95be","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Spears","original_name":"Kevin Spears","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577677789d97f00e3754594","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892638,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josh Dean","original_name":"Josh Dean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657766cdec8a4300c33a10b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892638,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josh Dean","original_name":"Josh Dean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577675f564ec700c473f563","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892638,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josh Dean","original_name":"Josh Dean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657766d335a61e00ad874269","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2999268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane J.
