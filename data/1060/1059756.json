The location is a nature preserve deep in the Japanese mountains. I.M. Pei is contracted as the architect. The project faces several hurdles: the building must be no taller than forty feet, the roof must be sloped, and so on. The architect, owners, and builders surmount all obstacles. A magnificent and innovative bridge connects visitors to the tunnel by which they enter the museum. After construction is complete, a large percentage of the building is covered with earth, which is then reforested to give the illusion that the site was hardly disturbed. Interviews with I.M. Pei show his awe and gratitude at being involved with such a grand project.","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Rosen Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The incredible story of a museum built on top of a mountain","title":"The Museum On The Mountain","video":true,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0238430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
