The joys of marriage and family are stressed. Long-term happiness should be the goal, not immediate gratification. A medical officer discusses sexual abstinence, saying that it will not adversely affect a man's virility. A commanding officer points out that sexual promiscuity among troops is not just the concern of the medical officer and the chaplain. He says that self-control should be practiced by everyone. Marriage and family should be the goal of every man. A chaplain speaks of abstinence and self-control as obedience to divine law. Shots include: sailors with their families; a wedding; sailors picking up girls and visiting prostitutes. There is some animation.","popularity":0.3227,"poster_path":"/keqelCTuy4I0zoMc1f5NM5f4E5g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9381,"logo_path":null,"name":"United States Navy","origin_country":""},{"id":10330,"logo_path":"/vevakirICdmHxRPeZUdbjFqcFLM.png","name":"Universal International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"United States Navy Training Film","title":"For Which We Stand: To Be Held In Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"For Which We Stand To Be Held In Honor","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wso4B19dkVqGV1lAtKq2mN1N1PE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/keqelCTuy4I0zoMc1f5NM5f4E5g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":549,"name":"prostitute"},{"id":4410,"name":"u.s. navy"},{"id":11011,"name":"morality"},{"id":46962,"name":"discipline"},{"id":172454,"name":"casual sex"},{"id":188720,"name":"shame"},{"id":199934,"name":"social guidance"},{"id":208328,"name":"training film"},{"id":216933,"name":"abstinence"},{"id":232418,"name":"squares"},{"id":237533,"name":"venereal diseases"},{"id":307763,"name":"scare film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1950-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
