From the serene courtyards of the University of Qarawiyyin to busling souk streets, from walled city of Fez to the mountainous sanctuary of Moulay Idris, the film shares the spiritual secrets of the places and their stories.  The beauty of the great city of Fez, founded by descendants of the Noble Prophet (May Allah swt shower blessings upon him), is shared by a visitor who is himself a direct descendant of that great household. The result is a moving meeting of two traditions that form the very core of great Islamic narrative.","popularity":0.4209,"poster_path":"/662DF8COSWPpa8kVFTh6YEUdbUc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188101,"logo_path":null,"name":"RadicalMiddleway","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2011-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fez: City of Saints","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3824996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Habib Umar Bin Hafiz","original_name":"Habib Umar Bin Hafiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eHtiP7yNIXvtdR3v1ytq92bcsro.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Scholar","credit_id":"6394f49f9f5dfb00916cf8b2","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"fezcityofsaintsfilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6qJls9C67Ufphq7Ew2qYQZYdrlT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/662DF8COSWPpa8kVFTh6YEUdbUc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":41610,"name":"saint"},{"id":208826,"name":"sufism"},{"id":268140,"name":"religious"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fez: City of Saints | Documentary | Trailer","key":"60996297","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-03-04T10:02:48.000Z","id":"6394f699a1a9ba007df842ca"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fez: City of Saints - Official Trailer","key":"CM8q_n_LzMY","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-08-20T16:25:22.000Z","id":"6394f684a0f1a200a0983072"}]}}}
