He received a hero’s welcome as the first man to set foot on the North Pole. He was greeted by the king, and given an honorary doctorate at the University of Copenhagen. Only a few days later, however, his endeavor was questioned, and in December the University rejected Cook’s documentation. Carl Th. Dreyer is seen as one of the journalists taking notes.","popularity":0.1487,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":188015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nordisk Films Kompagni","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dr. Cooks Arrival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Albert Cook","original_name":"Frederick Albert Cook","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tdti9xJaI2jrTsADwrYg818gvds.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6393402d283ed9008414e00b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Theodor Dreyer","original_name":"Carl Theodor Dreyer","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/l4g1K4ai3HgAIg0267O5ppnknVX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6393403df04d0100d1d172d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Christian X","original_name":"King Christian X","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6393404d6e0d7200c198755e","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3799,"name":"ship"},{"id":792,"name":"copenhagen, denmark"},{"id":1963,"name":"expedition"},{"id":236170,"name":"1900s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
