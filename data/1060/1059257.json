The ambitious structure of the five-part Fifth Symphony spans from the Funeral March to the roaring finale. It is a forthright attempt to resolve the tragic conflict with the surrounding world. The brilliant fourth part of the symphony, Adagietto, resembles a beautifully mysterious flower that every conductor reimagines in their own style. As one of the twentieth century’s most influential maestros, Mahler redefined the conductor’s role. For him, the conductor is just as integral to his own musical works as they are to the composer. When a maestro steps onto the podium and opens the score, he recreates musical universes from scratch. Teodor Currentzis and the musicAeterna orchestra have performed Mahler’s symphonies around the world for many years. The Fifth Symphony has earned its place as one of the highlights of the cycle.","popularity":0.4246,"poster_path":"/7CzfqVJhbtivriFkcxHIPlpW4oM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Jack Fébus","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":79564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony Classical","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahler: Symphony No. 5","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Teodor Currentzis conducts Mahler and Retinsky","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Teodor Currentzis & MusicAeterna Play Mahler 5th Symphony","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self – Conductor","credit_id":"63930634cee2f600e27c1117","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"musicAeterna","original_name":"musicAeterna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self – Orchestra","credit_id":"6393063dcee2f6009311367d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3818812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Blanch","original_name":"John Blanch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/6sK0ilgWGeSC3AdbBxMjsklWal2.jpg","credit_id":"63930622f04d0100bfae4a4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","credit_id":"6393070cba480200ea0aa2c5","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3818092,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maximilien Ciup","original_name":"Maximilien Ciup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639309bdf04d0100bfae4ba6","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431220,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julien Jaunet","original_name":"Julien Jaunet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639309e5f04d01008c421488","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3822763,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Théo Theres","original_name":"Théo Theres","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639309fef04d0100bfae4bc2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2635894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurent Lesperon","original_name":"Laurent Lesperon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63930a21283ed9008cdfe747","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustav Mahler","original_name":"Gustav Mahler","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/21kYlDN9JDw4cKw3Bs3pZyu81t0.jpg","credit_id":"63931210283ed9007fcbf823","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3203741,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexey Retinsky","original_name":"Alexey Retinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63931a88f04d01008c421aac","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7CzfqVJhbtivriFkcxHIPlpW4oM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/xA6T42xPS2R0aK7rblRQda1xg1u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"medici.tv","release_date":"2021-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Teodor Currentzis conducts Mahler's Symphony No 5 in C-sharp Minor","key":"Ufnb_n0FBVM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-17T16:00:10.000Z","id":"639316586e0d720084c1990c"}]}}}
