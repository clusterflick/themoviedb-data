G. Jung at Bollingen Tower Retreat","overview":"In 1951, Jung was filmed at his Bollingen retreat by two Americans, Jerome Hill, an artist and film-maker from Minnesota, and Maud Oakes, an author and researcher, whose book Where the Two Came to Their Father was the first major publication of the Bollingen Foundation. That book described a ritual and ceremonial sequence given to Maud by and old Navajo Medicine Man, along with its accompanying sand paintings. Maud had long been interested in Jung and his new psychology of the collective unconscious. She had met him in 1937 in New York, when she, along with her friends, Paul and Mary Mellon, attended a lecture he gave there.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":"/fDqREDIxS3jQSlYAciXFwFJiwq2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C.
