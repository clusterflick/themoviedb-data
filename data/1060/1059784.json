Sarah is mad at Thomas and steals his car, hitting him with a crowbar in the proces. As retaliation Thomas buries Sarah alive in the car. Sarah is panicking in the car, and doesn't know what to do. Then she hears something outside, it's Thomas. Realizing that she (Sarah) is not really buried, she puts the seatbelt around her neck to make it look as if she has committed suicide. When Thomas accidentally made a noise, he goes to check out the car, thinking Sarah must have heard. But when he sees that Sarah committed suicide, he rushes to call 911. When Thomas is busy calling, Sarah makes her move, and slips trough Thomas's fingers for the second and last time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lights Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3825047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wesley Versteeg","original_name":"Wesley Versteeg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6394ff692cefc200c389b9df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2202334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
