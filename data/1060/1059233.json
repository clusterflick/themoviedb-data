The play dramatized an old manâ€™s struggle to repossess his youth by searching through reels of audiotape. This performance was originally intended for television but never shown and subsequently put away and forgotten for nearly twenty years. The videotape has been restored and will remain a memorial to the late Jack MacGowran, Alan Schneider and William Ritman.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Krapp's Last Tape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Schneider","original_name":"Alan Schneider","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6392e7a8283ed9007fcbe7b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
