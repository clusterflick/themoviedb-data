Warm and compassionate, blunt and irascible, he leads us here through his preparations for a day in \"The Chair.\" In a remarkable and revealing conversation, he gives us an inside look at the hard life of a department store Santa including his unexpurgated opinions on kids, gold, Grammas, Mexican women, bad knees, good friends and money.  It is a bittersweet view from the other side of The Cozy Cloud Cottage -- touching, maddening and joyful. This is a portrait of Santa you've never seen before and will never forget.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/6qLSubEd97C8YE6W0Irhai7N4nE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Santa Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Jacobs","original_name":"Scott Jacobs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6392b2faf04d01008430c96f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0197849","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6qLSubEd97C8YE6W0Irhai7N4nE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
