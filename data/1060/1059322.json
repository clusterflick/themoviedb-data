Four days after the first SCUD missiles fell on Israel and weeks before the official start of the Gulf war, 8 members of Britain's SAS entered Iraq in secret. With many fearing a nuclear retaliation from Israel, their mission was to find and destroy the source of the missiles being fired. But the operation went spectacularly wrong. The SAS force was discovered and attacked. Some of the men were killed while others tried to escape by walking 200 miles across the Iraqi desert. Essentially abandoned, the men were left to fend for themselves, deep inside Iraq.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/rscPyLbyaC3ZCjt2kzyE5e3YqrD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SAS: Behind Iraqi Lines","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1352,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rscPyLbyaC3ZCjt2kzyE5e3YqrD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":901}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
