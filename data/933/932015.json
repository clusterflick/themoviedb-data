They work as rubbish sorters with the hope of one day returning to Zimbabwe and building a future for themselves there. On one of their routes, they come across an old, abandoned pondok, but they soon realize that it is no ordinary pondok: it can teleport them to anywhere on earth. They see a gap and use the pondok to transport people illegally to and from South Africa for a fee. However, Ruva's greed for money and ambition are causing life-threatening difficulties for him and his family.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AoAwfIkNp0DYvRf4NMM0Vw7levz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Walls and a Roof","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AoAwfIkNp0DYvRf4NMM0Vw7levz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
