The sound-track is a composition combining the musical score from the film Ballet Mechanique and the voices of film students testing various pieces of film recording equipment and complaining about grades and procedures.  The visuals reveal a modern day mechanical ballet performed by the instructor (myself) on the dada chessboard of absolute reality to the automatic beat of an intervalometer clicking time away one frame per second, as he attempts to relay technical data to his students.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SFAI (Art Institutionalized)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Angerame","original_name":"Dominic Angerame","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tX7O8nF6S7pdaL5BiIklBKdE6QF.jpg","credit_id":"61f734f97a97ab00732454f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
