Built like a nest, with the bare essentials, the film has a poetic dimension with its focus on the bird’s and children’s watchful observation and on a listening ear for their songs and flutterings. Home in the Air is not about aesthetics or anything premeditated, it’s a natural prayer of the soul, an ode to animal and human behavior. The sharp eye of a bird and the children’s voices off-camera give shape to this film which places itself somewhere between the Earthly and the Divine.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/lg2coZf9G99w0uFL8teJeaDXsTc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hogar al Aire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Home in the Air","type":"Translation - English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2037346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Verónica Font Alfaro","original_name":"Verónica Font Alfaro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625563d266ae4d0e832c5a85","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Vilallonga","original_name":"Elena Vilallonga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f4a1605f6c49008b82340f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Vilallonga","original_name":"Elena Vilallonga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f4a16bcedac40ec033827f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403106,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Demian Salvador","original_name":"Demian Salvador","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f4a1c7d71fb4001bafb23d","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Vilallonga","original_name":"Elena Vilallonga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f4a174bb1057006da5e4ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lg2coZf9G99w0uFL8teJeaDXsTc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
