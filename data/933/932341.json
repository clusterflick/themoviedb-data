The only contact to the outside world is the large window in the living room. Bo has for a long time kept an eye on Anemone and Karsten, who live in their respective apartments in the building opposite. He has created his own notion of who the two people are, and through his tape recorder, he has recorded his own narrative about them. But one day, Anemone and Karsten talk spontaneously together, which does not fit into Bo's reality. He is forced to leave the safe confines of the apartment and take a stand on the real world outside.","popularity":0.2697,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2012-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bag Glas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth M.
