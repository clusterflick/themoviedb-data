He is less known for his self-mockery, his humor and his fantasy. Talents that Philippe Bouvard or Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier have highlighted in their variety shows, since the 70s. A taste for comedy that opened the doors of the cinema, at over sixty years, in the film \"La Vérité si je mens\". Through rarely broadcast archives, it is an unexpected portrait of Enrico Macias, virtuoso artist, discoverer of talents and great showman, which takes shape thanks to his complicity with Mireille Dumas and his friends.","popularity":0.3391,"poster_path":"/iFW3txfVk0X2jhP727gQEhOdV7B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121241,"logo_path":null,"name":"MD Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enrico Macias, l'inattendu","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Macias","original_name":"Enrico Macias","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":"/pk2gnrs1Z5oHv9SNUpwrJWDr6vW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"61f6b5f2fe6c1800f432f545","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2002200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mireille Dumas","original_name":"Mireille Dumas","popularity":0.2829,"profile_path":"/1OcZsaYQ4L5UEQEsCjYd2r8x5ay.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrateur","credit_id":"61f6b64a559d220105cefbbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kendji","original_name":"Kendji","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/qjwVaLIYgplH2OpGXDv3jvZ9oe4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f6b693dfaae9009c4ecb35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dany Brillant","original_name":"Dany Brillant","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/dKoBtI5IWohnh4ZbJYpy4kGxysm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f6b6b457d3780065c2580e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Lecoq","original_name":"Yves Lecoq","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/5zevgL12G0wccqmSRSHnCvPsdsY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f6b6e6109230006b73aad9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gad Elmaleh","original_name":"Gad Elmaleh","popularity":0.6092,"profile_path":"/oxWWtXt59WrngUja6INnFlyxtD2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f6b70c028420006991c035","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Bouvard","original_name":"Philippe Bouvard","popularity":0.1588,"profile_path":"/bbTZrCAetCfnnczYsoXgJpIYZDo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f6b71e559d22006a033717","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Tovati","original_name":"Elisa Tovati","popularity":0.3807,"profile_path":"/2sTpOE58pcNUwlLiVsoTNTjFJLO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f6b7480c4c16004315e263","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2002200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mireille Dumas","original_name":"Mireille Dumas","popularity":0.2829,"profile_path":"/1OcZsaYQ4L5UEQEsCjYd2r8x5ay.jpg","credit_id":"61f6b49acb8028001c50976f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1275,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iFW3txfVk0X2jhP727gQEhOdV7B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 3","release_date":"2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
