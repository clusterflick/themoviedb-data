Juxtaposing static shots of stone buildings on \"sheer\" mountain sides with images of empty rooms, a ladder tilted against a wall, and a reflection of a car rounding a curve, Seaman suggests absence, unbalance, and the mystery of the everyday. A pair of hands clasped together, folding and unfolding, links the images together much as Seaman juxtaposes them for the viewer. Scissors on a table echo the \"cutting\" that is prevalent in Seaman's work, and provide another allusion to the title.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/e0CQrR6h0eR3mgETWSrzWe8YcK0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Seaman","original_name":"Bill Seaman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f4caac559d220043c34250","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e0CQrR6h0eR3mgETWSrzWe8YcK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
