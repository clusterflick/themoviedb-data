Tshidi is an award-winning artist and Jan is a PH abbreviation for \"professional hunter\". Tshidi does not know what a PH is and she is too shy to ask, but the Tinder dates go smoothly and they order an Uber. They arrive at Jan's Stellenbosch home. The lights are turned on and a wall full of hunting trophies is revealed. Is it a dream or a nightmare? Who is the hunter and who is the prey? The Vegan and the Hunter is a dark comedy about what happens when tastes radically differ - a wrong-com that investigates the trauma of generations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ag9Ql7niI1JIwdwm5skcDUh2Nzn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Vegan en die Jagter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ag9Ql7niI1JIwdwm5skcDUh2Nzn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
