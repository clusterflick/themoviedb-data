He arrives, and not being a good dodger, is knocked insensible by the first automobile he encounters. His disfigured face is shaven by a doctor, who adorns it with several large strips of plaster, gives him some new clothes and turns him loose. Arriving back in his home town he meets his wife's sister, attempts to embrace her and she, not recognizing his shaven face, summons the aid of a group of punchers who immediately put Alkali through a course of rough treatment, including a ducking in the watering trough, and finally land him in the town jail.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alkali Ike's Close Shave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augustus Carney","original_name":"Augustus Carney","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/9BIspBub8ZBUnhAo46xlndqcNC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alkali Ike","credit_id":"61f573de5f2db1011a45e56b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Potel","original_name":"Victor Potel","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/obZCOU7xnxvlkLLfHtlZPs3EB3Q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Slippery Slim","credit_id":"61f573ece9da69001ccf5d77","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
