Originally shot in Super-8 film, S.He is a lyrical rumination on the dualities of male and female, sound and image, motion and stasis. Seaman shot an industrial landscape from the window of a moving train, isolating the architecture's sculptural elements and subtly altering the images with slowed and staggered motion. Seaman's hypnotic, chanted text is a litany of associative and metaphorical phrases that, through linguistic and symbolic associations, defines the elusive, genderless identity of the title.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S.He","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Seaman","original_name":"Bill Seaman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f4c9f31130bd0102920342","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
