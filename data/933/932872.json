First made famous by Jonathan Safron Foer's 'Everything Is Illuminated', Trochenbrod was the only all-Jewish town to ever exist outside of Palestine. Trochenbrod's 5000 Jews were obliterated by the Nazis, except for 33 townspeople who escaped the massacre there. This personal search triggers a resurgence of interest in the town and reconnects the few remaining survivors who hadn't seen each other in over 60 years. 'Lost Town' utilizes contemporary documentary footage, original animation, and survivor testimonials to tell the story of how far one will go to claim their sense of identity.","popularity":0.0934,"poster_path":"/q0r6oZne2HHrUz9oF06F9Zk5YBo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Goldgewicht","original_name":"Richard Goldgewicht","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f711e86dc50700448e611a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3405639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Goldscheider","original_name":"Jeremy Goldscheider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f711d8c5ada500facc6dda","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Goldgewicht","original_name":"Richard Goldgewicht","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f711c65f2db100440968a3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3405639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Goldscheider","original_name":"Jeremy Goldscheider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f711b5bb10570117ac07c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Goldgewicht","original_name":"Richard Goldgewicht","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f711a5d7cd06001b48afde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2180459","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q0r6oZne2HHrUz9oF06F9Zk5YBo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2014-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallgrass Film Festival","release_date":"2013-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Philadelphia Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2014-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
