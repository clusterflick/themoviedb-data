Margaret Conneely (Chicago amateur filmmaker & CFA Collection namesake) frames stop-motion animation and trick photography with live action footage to fuel her very own Christmas fairy tale.  FAIRY PRINCESS (1956) was Margaret Conneely's most successful amateur film, winning a slew of local awards, and being named one of the Photographic Society of America's 'Ten Best films of 1956.' Conneely's film was also awarded the PSA's 'Harris B. Tuttle Trophy'; named after Eastman Kodak's innovator of the 16mm format, this trophy was awarded annually for the best amateur storytelling film on a family theme.  - Chicago Film Archives","popularity":0.4712,"poster_path":"/lDI6MGL51SkIUstyOz0oTUHvWY7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairy Princess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Conneely","original_name":"Margaret Conneely","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5d8bf37b3a90045a455cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Conneely","original_name":"Margaret Conneely","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5d8cec5ada500cd953bfc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Conneely","original_name":"Margaret Conneely","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5d8f7dcf87500c0a2f156","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDI6MGL51SkIUstyOz0oTUHvWY7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1991,"name":"santa claus"},{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":33630,"name":"doll"},{"id":193048,"name":"christmas spirit"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"},{"id":237866,"name":"chores"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1956-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fairy Princess (1956, Margaret Conneely)","key":"YfAAL-ANUME","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-06-16T20:17:19.000Z","id":"61f5dc8bd7cd0600a51882f4"}]}}}
