The collection spans 5,000 years of changing political dynasties and varying religious and foreign influences and represent every period of Chinese history. One of the most astonishing things about China is how little most Americans actually know about it, even though China’s culture is so present in our western world. We often see China as a nation casting off tradition in a mad rush to westernize. But below the hectic surface lies a steadfast culture that has influenced the West in deep and subtle ways.","popularity":0.6055,"poster_path":"/iFur7feyXCxBWaaQn84qcwrm9WR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"China: West Meets East at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"BD Wong","original_name":"BD Wong","popularity":1.5319,"profile_path":"/w7Hs9m6ocS2qlibvrLOvmyCKbAN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61f5f319bb105700a0ae7da8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Hearn","original_name":"Mike Hearn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61f5f37ee9da6900c428111f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe de Montebello","original_name":"Philippe de Montebello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61f5f39c559d2200c7c94407","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Leidy","original_name":"Denise Leidy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61f5f3abdfaae900f5dbbab1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Waat","original_name":"James Waat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61f5f50ac5ada500cd957bdd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Sun","original_name":"Jason Sun","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61f5f515e4886000d54a2321","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chesney Doyle","original_name":"Chesney Doyle","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f570dcf8750068456ee8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404471,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jon Miller","original_name":"Jon Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f5bac3926600d0af9914","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Doyle","original_name":"Marc Doyle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f34037b3a900c75254a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chesney Doyle","original_name":"Chesney Doyle","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f351c5ada50099957e62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404420,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Al Abronski","original_name":"Al Abronski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f59fe4886000a341a518","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Doyle","original_name":"Marc Doyle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f55737b3a9001bebbc27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193707,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven Zorn","original_name":"Steven Zorn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f56637b3a9006c523ea6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404421,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bobby Jones","original_name":"Bobby Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f5ad81140f00bd26d159","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3404418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chesney Doyle","original_name":"Chesney Doyle","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f5f54e57d3780065c16c8d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iFur7feyXCxBWaaQn84qcwrm9WR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
