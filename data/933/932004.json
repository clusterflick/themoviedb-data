It was her suggestion to arrange this Christmas dinner. A kind of tribute to her mother. But Stephan, her son, is less impressed that he is not allowed to invite his fianc√©e, Divan. Tilla thinks this romance will be just one too many for the old people to swallow. Grandpa's Alzheimer's was triggered by Grandma's sudden death. During the awkward Christmas dinner, Grandpa Andries decides to share big news with his family, but no one responds as he thought, and he shares the secret again - a few times.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eK8B7ImpDdnuEJi6nYnT7aKt1Tn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bittersoet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eK8B7ImpDdnuEJi6nYnT7aKt1Tn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
