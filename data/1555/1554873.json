Unable to pay his marker, Arizona reluctantly agrees to work it off by smuggling a woman up across the US/Mexico border for reasons unknown to him. While his own life is spiraling, he's forced to take on this new cagey, guarded companion with a veiled past of her own. Together they must navigate the inhospitable Sonoran desert, Cartel checkpoints, and their own unfortunate truths.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5xjfyaEUF6R6ViPFbKYTzWoWvXj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glass Features","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some Debts Can't Be Out Ran","title":"The Ballad of a Coyote","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428985,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trevor Riley","original_name":"Trevor Riley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/rcdapQ6mtc8BPfUeKgzlb1bt0zS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Arizona Meyers","credit_id":"68dbf7d18117ae5e07bb15c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1552359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Echeverria","original_name":"Marisa Echeverria","popularity":0.1975,"profile_path":"/uAOF32dqPO9D07YYOKbJS4d9dzK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martina Vasquez","credit_id":"68dbf7dedbc4b02213e1c92b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Rey Perez","original_name":"Anthony Rey Perez","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Angel Ruiz","credit_id":"68dbf7f31e26b5fddce1c9aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Earl Reid","original_name":"Michael Earl Reid","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/6nKhvKLHb8QCBmLCSddef3Tbri8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Clayton","credit_id":"68dbf800155d09fcdd2df2c8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Quaranto","original_name":"Anthony Quaranto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"68dbf81ba9e928635d38c9e4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428985,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trevor Riley","original_name":"Trevor Riley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/rcdapQ6mtc8BPfUeKgzlb1bt0zS.jpg","credit_id":"68dbf82a155d09fcdd2df2cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428985,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trevor Riley","original_name":"Trevor Riley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/rcdapQ6mtc8BPfUeKgzlb1bt0zS.jpg","credit_id":"68dbf8326cb09aefa038c93d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428985,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trevor Riley","original_name":"Trevor Riley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/rcdapQ6mtc8BPfUeKgzlb1bt0zS.jpg","credit_id":"68dbf845eb214f5134e1d2ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5720599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joel Stevens","original_name":"Joel Stevens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/llNsLkRNO99eBrwJtbC53Kf6rWA.jpg","credit_id":"68dbf8525cbc283030e1d308","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1552359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Echeverria","original_name":"Marisa Echeverria","popularity":0.1975,"profile_path":"/uAOF32dqPO9D07YYOKbJS4d9dzK.jpg","credit_id":"68dbf865a5ada44abbe1c89f","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17065572","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5xjfyaEUF6R6ViPFbKYTzWoWvXj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Independent Filmmakers Showcase Film Festival","release_date":"2023-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
