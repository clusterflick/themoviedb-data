They filmed the arrival of prisoners in the camp, workers in the battery factory and a football match organised within the camp. But also the horrific images of the departing trains to the extermination camps. Breslauer's material has always been preserved. A number of fragments of it are world-famous and are still used today in documentaries and other media. The residual material is virtually unknown, but at least as interesting because of the unique insight it provides into life at camp Westerbork.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kamp Westerbork - De Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel van den Berg","original_name":"Karel van den Berg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dbd1a6ad317f2b61bb14e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
