The film is titled Jafra, which suggests it was made in honor of solidarity with the Palestinian people. The word “Jafra” has been used through film and cultural resistance movements as a metaphor for Palestine itself – idealized, beautiful, longed for, and now lost or in exile.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jafra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiril Cenevski","original_name":"Kiril Cenevski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dbe1438117ae5e07bb1546","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
