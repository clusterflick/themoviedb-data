Space compresses but time stretches under this operation and instead of going nowhere, the repetition suggests infinity. As Dziga Vertov once said, there is time inside of time.  Merle Haggard was in the audience when Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins played this song, Folsom Prison Blues, at San Quentin. Carl Perkins' locomotive guitar solo gets caught up in the gears of this video and stretches like a penny on a rail under the weight of a passing train.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dFMHdLmf2CmRr0hrCKTgbOk2a1H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cash Crop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madison Brookshire","original_name":"Madison Brookshire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dbe5ac7fc0fbd47f2df7d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dFMHdLmf2CmRr0hrCKTgbOk2a1H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
