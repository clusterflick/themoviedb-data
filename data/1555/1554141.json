Mr Seymour, the hero of the book by London doctor Mr Paris, shows his invention – the thaumatrope – to a little girl and explains how it works. The superimposition of the images is not perfect, so he invents the use of elastic instead of the usual string. Only by recording the two successive images of the thaumatrope on a title bench can they be viewed perfectly. Numerous examples are shown.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2ngm5FLUooq72899ErYPRNNazSt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84534,"logo_path":null,"name":"SODEP","origin_country":""},{"id":229132,"logo_path":null,"name":"F.M.P.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thaumatropes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Levie","original_name":"Pierre Levie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da83a6569cc1dd02b41acb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Létang","original_name":"Frédéric Létang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da83c4ad317f2b61bb0e19","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134241,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alain Pierre","original_name":"Alain Pierre","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da83dee4955079ab530c0f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712411,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aliette Cremer","original_name":"Aliette Cremer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da8494569cc1dd02b41ad8","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Levie","original_name":"Pierre Levie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da84ee7148e624a1b9a2cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Forster","original_name":"Nadine Forster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da85150e484f2ea0b41ae4","department":"Art","job":"Draughtsman"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232381,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruno Zincone","original_name":"Bruno Zincone","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da852e9dfaa2792dc76901","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1314024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Françoise Levie","original_name":"Françoise Levie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68da8544ca2905bcaf530dcd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ngm5FLUooq72899ErYPRNNazSt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":320375,"name":"pre cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
