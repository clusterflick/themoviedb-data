Structured around a fictionalized interview with a real former member of the Italian extra-parliamentary radical left, the work highlights the subtle boundary between fiction, reality, and a constructivist approach to history. The piece employs both the language of documentary as well as cinematic language, probing how narratives are constructed and showing that the “fact” itself is ultimately inaccessible, existing only as a construction. The project was conceived for both single- and two-channel formats, comprising a single-channel screening version and a two-channel installation version.  The project was realised with the support of Injuve (Spanish Government), Community of Madrid, Cripta747 (Turin), and Torino Film Commission.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5aZBhw705cvMXNBSoNjMauqPIB6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":275816,"logo_path":null,"name":"Injuve","origin_country":""},{"id":275817,"logo_path":null,"name":"Community
