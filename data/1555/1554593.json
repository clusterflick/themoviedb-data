This summer, Nick is back at the farm to visit for a month and a half. And he's trying to make a movie about it.  There are lots of angles you could take when youâ€™re making a film about something as complicated as a farm. The movie jumps between interviews, animations, music videos, wizard battles and more, giving the viewer a fleeting look at the exciting, grueling, and beautiful aspects of a summer on Waterpenny Farm.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9owI9QVqylxLhoRxgzYfS35cAZL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A boy makes a movie about his parents' vegetable farm.","title":"Half a Summer on Waterpenny Farm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5719597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Bynum","original_name":"Rachel Bynum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rachel Bynum","credit_id":"68db2d9397e02aea2ebb1346","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5719596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Plaksin","original_name":"Eric Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eric Plaksin","credit_id":"68db2d8408335f4e5e2df2d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5719600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Plaksin","original_name":"Isaac Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Wizard 1 / Kid on Pogo Stick","credit_id":"68db2dd057468290a62df28b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5719599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bel De Coch","original_name":"Bel De Coch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bel / Wizard 2","credit_id":"68db2dc5c99913e8d0bb142c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5719601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Plaksin","original_name":"Nick Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator (voice) / Nicky P.","credit_id":"68db35d2506c444dbec76d0d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5719601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Plaksin","original_name":"Nick Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68db2e59ce2239051f38c89e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5719601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Plaksin","original_name":"Nick Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68db3059d747b9d0bd38c624","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5719601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Plaksin","original_name":"Nick Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68db3079f8fc54ac6e531a25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5719601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Plaksin","original_name":"Nick Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68db308752af5e3073e1d0cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5719601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Plaksin","original_name":"Nick Plaksin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68db31739bef492725e1d17c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1682,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sd7UX208CAdNCseJYjxj8HUJdoy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2991}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2928,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9owI9QVqylxLhoRxgzYfS35cAZL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1976}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer/Intro - Half a Summer on Waterpenny Farm","key":"wpWQJnkxK8E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-10T16:01:33.000Z","id":"68db31f02856ed0882530d5f"}]}}}
