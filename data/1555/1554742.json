One day when he hears a noblewoman in the audience complain that her beloved dog is missing, he performs magic that gives her a hint of the dog's whereabouts. Shortly afterward, the dog is discovered exactly where he hinted. Sandor is now earning a reputation as a magician gifted with clairvoyant powers, much to the delight of his friends Zsigmond, an inventor, and Gizella, a fortune teller, who work as his assistants.
