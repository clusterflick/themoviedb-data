Georgians who emigrated to France fight tirelessly for survival. One of the world’s most touristic cities becomes both a refuge and a last hope for many emigrants. The film uncovers corners of Paris that seem hidden within a city better known for its tourist attractions. Parallel Movements is a Georgia that exists beyond its borders. It resonates with the story of every Georgian who has already left, is leaving now, or will leave the country in the future.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/9ptzilzDDAvu2MG9SlupR6voAKy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chai Khana","origin_country":""},{"id":259590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chai Docs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exile, survival, and the search for home.","title":"Parallel Movements","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Bakradze","original_name":"Nino Bakradze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dbdff776719c573ee1cf39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davit Khukhua","original_name":"Davit Khukhua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dbe00576719c573ee1cf43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikheil Ninua","original_name":"Mikheil Ninua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dbe01357468290a62df595","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nestan Ivaniadze-Ninua","original_name":"Nestan Ivaniadze-Ninua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dbe03c004e86a2a1e1d1db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Shengelia","original_name":"Nino Shengelia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dbe049fed97aaddb2df3d8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalèa Rose Shengelia -
