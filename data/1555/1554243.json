Caught between work’s demands and his son’s birth, Abdul grapples with the fear of losing his job and the challenge of becoming a father from afar, and fights with his strict father-in-law for his right to perform the sacred tradition of reciting the Adhan for his newborn son.  The film Prayer, which explores the intersection of tradition, fatherhood, and the struggles of undocumented immigrant labor, is based on the autobiographical story of its screenwriter, Deo Mahameru. The project was created as a student film within the KinoEyes Joint European Film Masters at Lusofona University in Lisbon.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/g94nwZ2EcOIJDnUwSEfAXBtPFPK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lusófona University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Prayer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2015233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Regalla","original_name":"Igor Regalla","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/eMDNRoDxPK5vS5n8SobeXmAEFD8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Abdul","credit_id":"68daa8ac32fe147ee7e1cd21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3001432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joana Pialgata","original_name":"Joana Pialgata","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/onbFS9YS7Te1uqrOWF5lv9wLcE6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"68daa9f5487421c8cb38c446","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Santos","original_name":"Eric Santos","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/vl6BPoASiIcogIX0jZMgnGcXqxJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Baba","credit_id":"68daaa09358e0cdcdb530c4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5718473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inês Corino","original_name":"Inês Corino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aliya","credit_id":"68daaa3268491d4852b9a72d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Franco","original_name":"Sofia Franco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"68daaa4ad747b9d0bd38c2dd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5718483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Geweiler","original_name":"Sofia Geweiler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daaa6ace2239051f38c5ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3321009,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Deo Mahameru","original_name":"Deo Mahameru","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daaa81506c444dbec7699c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5718484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Piyush Garud","original_name":"Piyush Garud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daaa91358e0cdcdb530c78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661236,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michaela Hošková","original_name":"Michaela Hošková","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daaaa9950a51110ac768a2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425747,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olaf Taranczewski","original_name":"Olaf Taranczewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daaae9950a51110ac768a9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5718486,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Armen Papyan","original_name":"Armen Papyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daab0053f6f413a8c76e32","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3660075,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ashma Pokharel","original_name":"Ashma Pokharel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daab0f9221e538142deda1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5718489,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Natalia Castañola","original_name":"Natalia Castañola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68daab1c62db936e93b419b7","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2GPvQnBqwaYY0hogMOEPRhAgoEC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/olXfWQ035Uo50sok7F0FJLTPIEm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2622,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/6eNaCDtzvXFfbk4XFOpQo8Z9fiN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1860},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2622,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g94nwZ2EcOIJDnUwSEfAXBtPFPK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1860}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
