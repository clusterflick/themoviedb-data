The service facilitates re-ordering the house to fit the woman’s perception of success. None of the invitees show up beside the mailperson who spent the day delivering said invites only to realize they too received an invitation. The party of two proceed with the night of fine dining and connection, facilitated by the service workers, but all is not what it seems. Examining the commodification of success and its defining parameters, the film aims to explore the lengths one will go for a fleeting sensation of perceived achievement and purpose. If success is commodified then, just like any other good for sale, it has an expiry.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lTZLl85qDG6Jad4cF5V199Pwwle.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Central School of Speech and
