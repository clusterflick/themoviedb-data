In Limbo Transire brings to the screen a story of confrontation at the boundaries of love, resentment, and time. While focusing on the father–daughter relationship, the film builds an atmosphere that draws the audience in through the depth and unseen conflicts born of silence. It is not a classic “relationship” story; rather, it is a reckoning carried by the unsaid and the unspoken glances. “A daughter carries both love and resentment for her father; between them, the unspoken echoes in the silence of death.”","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/jlR1fkLAs463LklSuJHasIOvSbT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A father and a daughter… A reckoning suspended in time.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5258883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"SENA PEPE","original_name":"SENA PEPE","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Serap","credit_id":"68da6c84e4955079ab530b6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5717971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"HÜSEYİN MAZLUM","original_name":"HÜSEYİN MAZLUM","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"İhsan","credit_id":"68da6c9f1dd3ac1c35bb0f60","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5717966,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"A.
