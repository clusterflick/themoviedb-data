Expanding on the original with alternate cuts, added footage, and an “enhanced” mix, Packard adds a huge dose of hilarity and gore – most notably with a much louder guttural bear groan every time the classic Bear-POV cam appears, making its unnoticed approach on helpless campers even more hilarious.  Whether you’re a fan of the original or a newcomer to GRIZZLY, you’ll find something to love here. Crack a cold one, sharpen your pencils and don your camo for this “extra scary” redux.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/4tK5yzRe3WRdxtjSDHGV3sUs3u2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grizzly Redux","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damon Packard","original_name":"Damon Packard","popularity":1.3182,"profile_path":"/oOFRTIqiNxIWaWkNUqW2h5srNrs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dbe727c7b43c600db421a1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damon Packard","original_name":"Damon Packard","popularity":1.3182,"profile_path":"/oOFRTIqiNxIWaWkNUqW2h5srNrs.jpg","credit_id":"68dbe73cfab6402503bb153e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damon Packard","original_name":"Damon Packard","popularity":1.3182,"profile_path":"/oOFRTIqiNxIWaWkNUqW2h5srNrs.jpg","credit_id":"68dbe748899a5a5cf8bb142c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.38,"height":316,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aYaS5vQUmjMO0uhS7qwBkJRpHp9.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":752}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1266,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4tK5yzRe3WRdxtjSDHGV3sUs3u2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":844},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1262,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jRzeZJDZqCsYFh4lYqI2emVJ4IE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":841}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2522,"name":"grizzly bear"},{"id":280365,"name":"remix"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
