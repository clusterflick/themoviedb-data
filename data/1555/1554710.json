Raised in a caravan, the protagonists have settled in the countryside and are trying to cope with the responsibilities of running a farm. In a broader context, it attempts to tell the story of a person's attempt to adapt to new living conditions, to question their value in isolation from tradition, and above all, to express a longing for what is irretrievably lost.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agor Dromesko.
