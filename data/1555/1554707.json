He is about to begin his third circumnavigation of the globe. He practices a rare and little-known sport in Poland: ultramarathon running. In two days of continuous running, he is able to cover 378 km – the distance from Bielsko-Biała to Warsaw. What is commonplace for him is impossible and crazy for the average mortal. His achievements are impressive: third place in the world championships in the 48-hour run and second place in the European championships in the 24-hour run. Despite this, he remains unknown to most people.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Długodystansowiec","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
