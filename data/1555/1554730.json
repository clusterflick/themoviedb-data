The piece comprises a series of five essays that work both together and individually. Each essay studies the migration processes of an object: oranges, pineapples, feathers, poppies and corn. Seen together, they trace a bodegón that spans more than a thousand years, going from China to Europe and passing through Latin America, the Caribbean and the United States.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bodegón 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
