A type of conversation in which words are replaced by graphic equivalents articulated by the interlocutors, taking the form of typographic elements floating in the space between the characters. It is there that couplings, frictions and collisions occur at the junction of two worlds, revealing the fundamental shortcoming of everyday existence - the inability to communicate. Words travel along invisible trajectories, often not reaching their recipients, passing each other and losing their way. Repetitions of gestures, words and signals create a kind of mantra of meanings, attempts to define, name and set one's own boundaries of mental independence, which often makes mutual coexistence difficult.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374888,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcin Wojciechowski","original_name":"Marcin Wojciechowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68db8443dbc4b02213e1c74a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34526999","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
