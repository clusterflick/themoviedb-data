Composed of shots of the ocean and architecture at a small church on the island of Sifnos, each image is separated by sections of black film. In Anne Carson’s translation of Sappho square brackets represent missing or destroyed pieces of parchment. Likewise sections of black film stand in for the gaps in our vision, what’s forgotten, and what’s lost to passing time.  What do we long for in the absence of the image?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kHq0vN99U2EkMRTDGsXZZmcCpGl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Go, So we may see","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5720355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucinda Eva-May","original_name":"Lucinda Eva-May","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dbcc70358e0cdcdb5312e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kHq0vN99U2EkMRTDGsXZZmcCpGl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
