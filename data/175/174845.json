So when a night of partying leads to a new family of friends and fun, Kyle sees an opportunity for escape from reality. But Kyle's new friendship with Maia and Dusty and the trio's love of crystal meth eventually cost Kyle his job, his companion, his home and his family. Kyle's escape becomes his trap, the party is an illusion and the crystal is slowly killing him, physically and psychologically. When he finally bottoms out and is no longer the young man his father once boasted about with pride, Kyle must choose: life or meth.","popularity":2.4213,"poster_path":"/uD698lf6mJlUdGq3drchkQso8ZT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meth Head","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lukas Haas","original_name":"Lukas Haas","popularity":2.0985,"profile_path":"/6LNGu3o2aBiYNTDkbXMDIGyQtBh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"52fe4d53c3a36847f825af59","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blake Berris","original_name":"Blake Berris","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/pm6J4LQIFEnCbKsRrbCAcRr8Ejs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dusty","credit_id":"52fe4d53c3a36847f825af6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Necar Zadegan","original_name":"Necar Zadegan","popularity":0.6359,"profile_path":"/25cjlqMmnbfTCgh3kLijOH57URG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maia","credit_id":"52fe4d53c3a36847f825af5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Cruz","original_name":"Wilson Cruz","popularity":0.5141,"profile_path":"/lVvWWl3C01L8p7DimH4BERiTiN5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julian","credit_id":"52fe4d53c3a36847f825af61","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay Pulsipher","original_name":"Lindsay Pulsipher","popularity":0.4353,"profile_path":"/87tRNSIGJtSpmXEz5iutmDOgWkf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Judith","credit_id":"52fe4d53c3a36847f825af6f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Rossi","original_name":"Theo Rossi","popularity":1.4027,"profile_path":"/344QE41Jileu4OE41cmYgBxc5BF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"5563f4c9c3a368740e002928","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Patterson","original_name":"Scott Patterson","popularity":1.117,"profile_path":"/qTm0LFuV8DktunzKa5T3UZoq1tC.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hank","credit_id":"625dc53e33a3760065528dd4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1231526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candis Cayne","original_name":"Candis Cayne","popularity":0.4993,"profile_path":"/s0JDLERtTEWiNKe9VrU69iKdf8J.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Pinkie","credit_id":"625dc58a9ee0ef009a241385","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Snyder","original_name":"James Snyder","popularity":0.1817,"profile_path":"/ug22DUrWbCYNRp6ehrbD9lNMW6w.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"625dc5a8f10a1a31c03f749e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Profeta","original_name":"Victoria Profeta","popularity":0.4952,"profile_path":"/eY7E7cML1eHm2yzAYORCdIc1mqc.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Carolyn","credit_id":"625dc5bf33a37600a93e5bb3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3513063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johnny Carrillo","original_name":"Johnny Carrillo","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Bobby Blue (credited as John W.
