He is immediately spotted by a crook who dispatches a fetching lady to shake him down. At a restaurant, she gets him drunk and lays him out with knockout drops. But what's in the bag is not what she is expecting, and she flees. The now-drunken farmer has stepped dizzily outside to acquaint himself with a lamppost when another sharper steps up and hauls him into a crooked card game. While prospects do not look good for Farmer Al Falfa, he has more tricks up his sleeve than the city slickers realize.","popularity":0.1238,"poster_path":"/lb6fqGfLwwfdCOUlL2vO3ZKZFvN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farmer Al Falfa Sees New York","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Terry","original_name":"Paul Terry","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/9nUH3iMaImOynJyXfo11Hp8b4q4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d4cc3a36847f82598e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0146725","wikidata_id":"Q16250310","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3r6eNFClZ0un5GiXPvy4kUkM9JG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lb6fqGfLwwfdCOUlL2vO3ZKZFvN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Farmer Alfalfa - Sees New York - 1916","key":"y4XQqW0N9jA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-06T22:39:33.000Z","id":"67ad7cd553353f9bba36e870"}]}}}
