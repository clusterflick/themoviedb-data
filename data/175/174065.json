Autumn, 1918: Somewhere on Germany’s western front, Ernst Thälmann, age twenty-four, is calling on his fellow soldiers to put down their guns and join him in the communist struggle at home. When Hamburg’s Police Commissioner blocks a much-needed food shipment to the workers of Petrograd, Ernst battles to see it allowed through. Until his murder on August 18, 1944, Ernst remained true to his political convictions in the face of many setbacks.","popularity":0.7992,"poster_path":"/vOCjyJK2OXoDGMgvnXNwjRv2tKb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1955-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ernst Thälmann – Leader of the Working Class","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ernst Thälmann: Leader of His Class","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Эрнст Тельман – вождь своего класса","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Ernst Thälmann – Líder de su clase","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","title":"Ernst Thälmann – Lãnh đạo của Giai cấp mình","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Simon","original_name":"Günther Simon","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/sti941HR8eflY6aeFkXfi1vOSP5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ernst Thälmann","credit_id":"5728a6ad9251415f75000542","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Peter Minetti","original_name":"Hans-Peter Minetti","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/2d2L5sFS59G0awAgfupSje4ki0r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fiete Jansen","credit_id":"5728a7ed9251414d7300260e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karla Runkehl","original_name":"Karla Runkehl","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/svjHeuSsMcvyWeP3RYXDYVpMEzD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Änne Jansen","credit_id":"579277489251410d120034bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Piccoli","original_name":"Michel Piccoli","popularity":0.6123,"profile_path":"/4OgjMYKH3qi67HOeEvYoIeENMDW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Maurice Rouger","credit_id":"57927759c3a36828a6001563","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Peters","original_name":"Werner Peters","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/q17exadTllfGAQ2qfAGO2S3plFb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Quadde","credit_id":"579277699251410cbb00386f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Delmare","original_name":"Fred Delmare","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/xQtIdXUM5J8qtkXlPxfiHbwXeFY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Soldat","credit_id":"579277789251416dad00459e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul R.
