A story of a Jewish girl forced to hide her identity in order to attend medical school in St. Petersburg, the movie is a melodrama of multiple oppression. Lea, as played by Negri, is at a disadvantage as a woman, an orphan and a Jew -- and yet has immense persistence and an insatiable ambition of becoming a doctor. The film includes more than one plot twist (the final one further complicating the issue of Lea's identity), but it's first and foremost a testimony to a spirit impossible to suppress.","popularity":0.2577,"poster_path":"/5uYzqspXz0VFlMWGyIU7DuWGSfc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG Union","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1918-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Yellow Ticket","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Devil's Pawn","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pola Negri","original_name":"Pola Negri","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":"/2KI4sZ31LcUR9dBN2ij9GTr8pMd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lea, the Professor's Adopted Daughter","credit_id":"52fe4d55c3a36847f825b4e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Liedtke","original_name":"Harry Liedtke","popularity":0.331,"profile_path":"/6uub4Y8JGTi2MmzbFVq5DD2Yf5o.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Demetri, a Medical Student","credit_id":"533ad7789251417d9e0069aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Janson","original_name":"Victor Janson","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/jmjkAwDfzOFMyDcyYYsaBl99NFS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ossip Storki","credit_id":"533ad78c92514129100004e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf E.
