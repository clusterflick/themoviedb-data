She was married to a revolutionary and the matrimony ended in tragedy. She likes to flirt with men but due to her traumatic sentimental past, she doesn't allow herself attachments. That is until she meets a young diplomat who will help her to make up her mind and exorcize her old sentimental traumas.","popularity":0.1735,"poster_path":"/30JdKhinReDareP5o8ncFuOOlGw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Itala Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1916-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Royal Tigress","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Menichelli","original_name":"Pina Menichelli","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/lKzds3ubxoJPxO8fJeRBuCG0rYs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Countess Natka","credit_id":"58f3a57cc3a36807bd011e3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Nepoti","original_name":"Alberto Nepoti","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Giorgio la Ferlita","credit_id":"58f3a5c2c3a36808350140f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Febo Mari","original_name":"Febo Mari","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dolski","credit_id":"58f3a5c99251413dbe01466f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Frascaroli","original_name":"Valentina Frascaroli","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/oaomvRuXr26x2hLUmCp4KS92hKK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Erminia","credit_id":"58f3a5d19251413d6e0152b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Vaser","original_name":"Ernesto Vaser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Il droghiere","credit_id":"58f3a5d9c3a3680845014647","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Gemelli","original_name":"Enrico Gemelli","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"58f3a5dec3a36807df0131ee","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonaventura Ibáñez","original_name":"Bonaventura Ibáñez","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"58f3a5e39251413d7201460d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Moreau","original_name":"Gabriel Moreau","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"58f3a5e99251413d72014612","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Pastrone","original_name":"Giovanni Pastrone","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/dU5FZLU78TWOjdP8qRn1GRrUc6o.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d4cc3a36847f825996f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236429,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giovanni Verga","original_name":"Giovanni Verga","popularity":0.231,"profile_path":"/8VP7T9mB2RG1KLlbFiuJx7bNUPI.jpg","credit_id":"58f3a55f9251413d80013a05","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236429,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giovanni Verga","original_name":"Giovanni Verga","popularity":0.231,"profile_path":"/8VP7T9mB2RG1KLlbFiuJx7bNUPI.jpg","credit_id":"58f3a564c3a36807df013189","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Segundo de Chomón","original_name":"Segundo de Chomón","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/3iCsGlo1XUbvy61411fMHb8bZdP.jpg","credit_id":"58f3a56b9251413dbe01460d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":41614,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giovanni Tomatis","original_name":"Giovanni Tomatis","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f3a5739251413d6e015262","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0007459","wikidata_id":"Q3991294","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/30JdKhinReDareP5o8ncFuOOlGw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
