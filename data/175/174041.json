We see the book enacted: Weakhands loses his girlfriend to Bruteforce, but chances upon a design for a weapon to vanquish his rival and win her back. His tribe sees this and sets him up as their leader. With the club, he fends off various creatures (a winged lizard, a snake, a dinosaur) and a rival tribe led by Monkeywalk. The women even manage to repel an attack. But the rival tribe discovers the secret of the club themselves, and capture the women. Weakhands, sitting in despair, chances upon a new weapon: the bow and arrow.","popularity":0.188,"poster_path":"/wmpiB0hZkwXwWBY6X9AmbaLIBod.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A psychological comedy founded on the Darwinian theory of the evolution of man","title":"Brute Force","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Primitive Man","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harry Faulkner (Prologue) / Weakhands (The Old Days)","credit_id":"52fe4d42c3a36847f8257563","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Marsh","original_name":"Mae Marsh","popularity":0.2742,"profile_path":"/1PDFSBQCwJ1yteuffEJgwSrAVra.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lilywhite","credit_id":"52fe4d42c3a36847f8257567","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William J.
