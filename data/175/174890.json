Can cannabis cause schizophrenia? Is it addictive? Can it lead you on to harder drugs? Or is it simply a herb, an undervalued medicine?  Addiction specialist Dr John Marsden discovers that modern science is finally beginning to find answers to these questions. John traces the cannabis plants' birthplace in Kazakhstan; finds the origins of our sensitivity to cannabis in the simple sea squirt; and shows just what it does to our brains.  He meets people who have been changed by this drug in drastically different ways - from those whose lives have been shattered to those who lives have been revived.","popularity":0.1047,"poster_path":"/noQEl0zjbav9w1PvQZFGEOwNqYy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cannabis: The Evil Weed?","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Cannabis En Ond Urt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":145244,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Marsden","original_name":"John Marsden","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Presenter (as Dr John Marsden)","credit_id":"52fe4d54c3a36847f825b323","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1387875","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3jrzsTMPJnp1pWYd3RNUWAWnO34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/noQEl0zjbav9w1PvQZFGEOwNqYy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
