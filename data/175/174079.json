Leaving their matchbox, they line the film in circular, concentric movements.  In an almost aquatic momentum, the squadron of little bits of wood mould the contours of a character, a run-of-the-mill smoker, before transforming into a funny harness.  The film ends when the matches, again transformed, take on the appearance of a distinguished man who, after several attempts, finally finds a way of lighting his cigarette.","popularity":0.1918,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Générale des Cinématographes Éclipse","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1914-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fancy Matches","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Cerillas fantasiosas","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les allumettes fantaisies","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les allumettes magiques","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Magic Matches","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émile Cohl","original_name":"Émile Cohl","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/pQ9gkv6SkohobpGlzxMqGYfWd6G.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d43c3a36847f8257753","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0139827","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
