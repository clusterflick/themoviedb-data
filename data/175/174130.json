The picture opens with our hero riding a mule through a creek bed, when he is set upon by some robbers. Gussle outsmarts them by attempting to hand over his goods by stretching across the stream, but dropping the goods into the water thereby making the robber also fall in. He makes his way to an inn and recounts his experiences to the other guests and then they all go out and spend time playing in the snow. Some trick photography is used to make it appear that Gussle is making a mule walk backwards.","popularity":0.1398,"poster_path":"/yekZjd1LUnFRU9xFBhRFVfBnVns.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gussle's Backward Way","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syd Chaplin","original_name":"Syd Chaplin","popularity":0.1273,"profile_path":"/rjmxPFkDw1TNCblSAmUsxtxwuQx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gussle","credit_id":"52fe4d44c3a36847f8257afd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Avery","original_name":"Charles Avery","popularity":0.1172,"profile_path":"/jusDHfvZ1jfzF9wNoeZ3DtIuQrJ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d44c3a36847f8257af3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syd Chaplin","original_name":"Syd Chaplin","popularity":0.1273,"profile_path":"/rjmxPFkDw1TNCblSAmUsxtxwuQx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d44c3a36847f8257af9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0005435","wikidata_id":"Q120730430","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yekZjd1LUnFRU9xFBhRFVfBnVns.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1156}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
