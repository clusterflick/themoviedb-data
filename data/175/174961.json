Because her daughter, who knows nothing of her mother's station in life, is to return the next day from her school in the east, Rosie is granted three days of grace to be spent in company with her daughter at a nearby cabin. The three days begin happily enough, thanks to the serenades of heroic bandit Alvarez and the poetry of romantic Randolph. But Bagley, the dance hall manager, has seen the daughter and has determined to make her his own.","popularity":0.3858,"poster_path":"/liQNvx1GbIrvIgtMratWr42JEZM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4759,"logo_path":null,"name":"D.W.
