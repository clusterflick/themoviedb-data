Grieg's \"Peer Gynt Suite\" accompanies images of common objects and abstract forms photographed in soft focus and through prisms: rings, pyramids, the staff of musical notes, and floating lights are all seen in multiple images, sometimes as if through a kaleidoscope, other times as if in animation. Images appear and patterns move across the screen. Sparklers celebrate at the film's end.","popularity":0.104,"poster_path":"/qkiE6YYJ8GB56SXVgbZtrSHC1Y6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rhythm in Light","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melville Webber","original_name":"Melville Webber","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f82581fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Nemeth","original_name":"Ted Nemeth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jXi8fwyjGpoZrF9TOT9ix0i6nLD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f82581f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Ellen Bute","original_name":"Mary Ellen Bute","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/D9vJ1Q994vHhDlPkgFo3ifm4Go.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f82581ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025716","wikidata_id":"Q68924480","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qkiE6YYJ8GB56SXVgbZtrSHC1Y6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mjKkIEN1t81NVwMxxOnclm4NI8o.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
