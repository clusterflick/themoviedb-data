We see hands close up: working, playing, praying, whittling, and strumming. Hands use saws and hammers, lift stones, turn wheels, then write, type, apply a bandage, play a violin, use a compass, and hold a U.S. Treasury note. Hands put a shoe on a customer, shake a thermometer, and count out bills and coins into other waiting hands. A hand places an engagement ring on a finger, buys a movie ticket, and reels in a fishing line. There are multiple images repeating what we've seen. A chicken is basted; other chickens get grain. It's a national celebration.","popularity":0.0737,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hands","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willard Van Dyke","original_name":"Willard Van Dyke","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/mwowj0Z5rj6UBvBeqF5hDE57L63.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f82581e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Steiner","original_name":"Ralph Steiner","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573125b0c3a36819c2000e19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0125776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aNy7GfHAiZgCXEKVY2NvNWQWkan.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
