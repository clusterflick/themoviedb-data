Many wild things occur to him in the cartoons and they are meant to be silly entertainment. Here, he gets into a fight with a kangaroo.

And, as a result, there is a funny lingering after-effect.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/1IzXQuYuoAlEJwreviTcNN8ul8d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colonel Heeza Liar on the Jump","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110408,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Randolph Bray","original_name":"John Randolph Bray","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/mdWa0YdpPaZvpprJqD2kRjDGuyg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d4fc3a36847f825a359","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0007812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1IzXQuYuoAlEJwreviTcNN8ul8d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Colonel Heeza Liar on the Jump (J.R.
