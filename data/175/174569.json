Telling the story of the Life of Christ, the film is divided into three segments-- three Mysteries. The first of these includes the Birth of Jesus, the arrival of the Magi, Herod and the slaughter of the innocents, the flight into Egypt. The second Mystery features the expulsion of the merchants from the Temple, Mary Magdalene's conversion and Christ's entry into Jerusalem. The third Mystery is itself divided into three separate parts, which are The Passion, The Death and The Resurrection.","popularity":0.4136,"poster_path":"/uLTwa9ATsVRPCsCmSBudFXAhVkJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Italiana
