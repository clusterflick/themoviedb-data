Later, he weds the grateful young Turkish girl whom he saved from the waters of the Danube. While skillfully managing his wife's fortune, entrepreneur Tímar becomes an important wholesaler of wheat and exports his products to Brazil. But his marriage of convenience proves a failure. He is torn between the demands of bourgeois civilization, governed by money, and the ideal of freedom, consisting of living simply within nature. He then takes refuge by the side of the sweet Noemi on an island on the Danube.","popularity":0.1833,"poster_path":"/7Z8CakydMh60uaREYpzXRkckib7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corvin Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1919-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man of Gold","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Man of Gold","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Red Half-Moon","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der rote Halbmond","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Demi-lune rouge","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Златният човек","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyula Bartos","original_name":"Gyula Bartos","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Az öreg Krisztyán","credit_id":"53a387b60e0a2667d90002fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Beregi Sr.","original_name":"Oscar Beregi Sr.","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/ktBvBRP1d2s3YsVd2osbr1f5hwX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tímár Mihály","credit_id":"53a387c60e0a2667cd00035f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Berky","original_name":"Lili Berky","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":"/nEySDpaxijh5YdYDK8v08oIe7oG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Athalia,Brazovic lánya","credit_id":"53a387dc0e0a2667bf00031e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenõ Horváth","original_name":"Jenõ Horváth","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/hL1H1SoY6mD9WdyAYyaEWg31wn0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Brazovic Atanáz","credit_id":"53a387eb0e0a2667c9000366","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1515312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mari K.
