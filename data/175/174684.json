The marvelous natural music at the tops of the eponymous trees makes way for the rhythmic cadence of civilization—men baring axes and the natural clatter of daily life—before their unforgettable return home from the forest. The singular artistry of director Michelangelo Frammartino (Le quatro volte) is beautifully displayed in this mesmerizing homage to nature.","popularity":0.3463,"poster_path":"/5LLFVJSq4JvBlTpNIe82f2we2mF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7144,"logo_path":"/wqc8HTYdCCFnguN2Ma55lr2HIyC.png","name":"Vivo
