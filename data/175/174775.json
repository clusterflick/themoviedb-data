They seek to sell insurance to the wealthy womanizer Israel Israeli, and use all available means for this purpose: Katz's elder daughter Naomi uses her feminine charms on Israeli, while Carasso's elder son Osi does the same with his actress friend Daniela. Despite the rivalry, Naomi and Osi grow fond of each other. Meanwhile, Katz's beatnik daughter Tiki meets Eliyahu, Carasso's younger son, and they start an affair. The fathers are very displeased from the growing romance between the two couples, and they become even more irritated to find out that they are competing on the same potential client.","popularity":0.2386,"poster_path":"/icGb7FA5ZhO82lJTdSpYTOxfv3h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noah Films","origin_country":""},{"id":76565,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Motion Picture Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1971-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katz and Carrasso","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Contract","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Katz V'Carasso","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehuda Barkan","original_name":"Yehuda Barkan","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/Ac6AYVXJ8JZSvWgcKwQv32cI17v.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joseph 'Osi' Carasso","credit_id":"52fe4d51c3a36847f825a9bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yosef Shiloach","original_name":"Yosef Shiloach","popularity":0.2993,"profile_path":"/nykPPj1fWjPAtpBoFJLOuFGBvNQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kadosh Carasso","credit_id":"52fe4d51c3a36847f825a9c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nitza Shaul","original_name":"Nitza Shaul","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/dc1rP8gntPkAJoCxyFkaZb0MP8I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tikva 'Tiki' Katz","credit_id":"52fe4d51c3a36847f825a9c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmuel Rodensky","original_name":"Shmuel Rodensky","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/1vdD0MY4OpVdsyBdlIdslZuUNgp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shmuel Katz","credit_id":"52fe4d51c3a36847f825a9bf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Menahem Golan","original_name":"Menahem Golan","popularity":0.3251,"profile_path":"/qGtHMLd4E7tRyw75H4lWTRelW7B.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d51c3a36847f825a9cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Menahem Golan","original_name":"Menahem Golan","popularity":0.3251,"profile_path":"/qGtHMLd4E7tRyw75H4lWTRelW7B.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d51c3a36847f825a9d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157371,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yosef Gross","original_name":"Yosef Gross","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d51c3a36847f825a9d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Menahem Golan","original_name":"Menahem Golan","popularity":0.3251,"profile_path":"/qGtHMLd4E7tRyw75H4lWTRelW7B.jpg","credit_id":"5d3e7de7b87aec2c3d3a40c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33009,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoram Globus","original_name":"Yoram Globus","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":"/bKbeXNvErtCQiK3pEEnFgmR9cvo.jpg","credit_id":"5d3e7dd221621b0012f352ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142428","wikidata_id":"Q6601662","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/plRREFkg6TcWnagItfml4N512AF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/icGb7FA5ZhO82lJTdSpYTOxfv3h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
