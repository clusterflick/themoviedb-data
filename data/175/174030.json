The offending golfer, Ambrose, and his wife feel terrible about the erring ball; but if they knew what Gussle was capable of, they'd have left him lying on the green. Later, at his social club, Gussle gets thrown out of a card game for cheating. Ambrose, ignorant of the exiting Gussle's dishonesty, greets him warmly before joining the game himself. Gussle suddenly has an idea that will give him revenge on the card players and get rid of Ambrose so that Gussle can make his moves on his gullible friend's beautiful wife.","popularity":0.171,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gussle, the Golfer","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syd Chaplin","original_name":"Syd Chaplin","popularity":0.1273,"profile_path":"/rjmxPFkDw1TNCblSAmUsxtxwuQx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Reggie Gussle","credit_id":"52fe4d42c3a36847f82574c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mack Swain","original_name":"Mack Swain","popularity":0.1784,"profile_path":"/xYULwPUrtqZz50Eaiz3BeZP83iq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ambrose","credit_id":"52fe4d42c3a36847f82574c7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dell Henderson","original_name":"Dell Henderson","popularity":0.2378,"profile_path":"/gA4BPbRHPSvI16n1QcRlAd3gmSo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d42c3a36847f82574bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0248057","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
