(Maybe it's because Popeye isn't squinting here.) Anyhow, Olive has made the mistake of hiring them. She hasn't finished packing yet, so the boys, smitten as soon as she answers the door, compete to help her. Once packed, they compete to move more impressive piles of her belongings. Popeye easily wins these contests, even though Bluto locks him in the van at one point. At the end, Bluto socks Popeye into the piano, then into a table; though he hardly seems to need it, Popeye still eats his spinach, then thrashes Bluto.","popularity":0.5701,"poster_path":"/5cg7CntvHtp8wrapB4OPL2wtBGi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Haul in One","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f8258337","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f825833b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f8258333","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a36847f825832f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"654aa57f532acb011b10ee90","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116338,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dave Tendlar","original_name":"Dave Tendlar","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654aa592fd4f80011ed2d115","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654aa588fd4f800101b7a45e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b479ae1d1bf400a02f9d6d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Larz Bourne","original_name":"Larz Bourne","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b479b95ad76b0094c969c5","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148158,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Al Eugster","original_name":"Al Eugster","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b479e0c56d2d00f310ae31","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423777,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Owen","original_name":"Robert Owen","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b47a28391b9c0083c1dda7","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093238,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Wm.
