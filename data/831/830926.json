The machines are better, faster and more efficient at everything, outstripping their makers. However, one aspect of humanity escapes them: love. Their guidebook attempts to capture the phenomenon in 64 terms, including jealousy, regret and ardour. Posing in homey and romantic settings, they run through the entire spectrum with digital precision, yet without a hint of passion.  Director Ashish Avikunthak outlines a worrying, yet confusing impression of a posthuman future in which technology has overtaken and annexed humanity. He presents the new masters of the universe as 2.0 versions of the Hindu pantheon. Yet while Hanuman, Shiva and Kali sometimes reveal all too human traits, this is definitely not the case when it comes to love. Loves dies out with humanity.","popularity":1.4253,"poster_path":"/xcZ8susD7CfdFY4jfuPdGmwvoad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glossary of Non-Human Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1966860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satarupa Das","original_name":"Satarupa Das","popularity":0.1638,"profile_path":"/7d6P6CYCB50VIhTCBGeGYDMYbVX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60c7287048333a0041bcda32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3124538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayshree Mukherjee","original_name":"Jayshree Mukherjee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60c7287a99259c0041158ae2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sagnik Mukherjee","original_name":"Sagnik Mukherjee","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60c72881d132d600416ae714","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3124539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megha Roy","original_name":"Megha Roy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60c72888b6c2640058afea1c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3124540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bijoli Sarkar","original_name":"Bijoli Sarkar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60c728916c0b36005920f0db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3124541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prasanta Sarkar","original_name":"Prasanta Sarkar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60c7289518864b002974abc0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2317080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debleena Sen","original_name":"Debleena Sen","popularity":0.3186,"profile_path":"/3AZgWVWvnSzDM4Ix4M1i8N581jC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60c7289c4e6742003e3400a0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ashish Avikunthak","original_name":"Ashish Avikunthak","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/6b9VddGlYieZnVJOaVTlhbP0EiK.jpg","credit_id":"60a3af90764b990029dcf994","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208688,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Basab Mullick","original_name":"Basab Mullick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c728aa58efd30078a5ce4b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14685864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1276,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xcZ8susD7CfdFY4jfuPdGmwvoad.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":850},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wnLGTEFEiYyrzAPGPNXI6GKqVih.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":906}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Glossary of Non-Human Love – trailer | IFFR 2021","key":"KXrWlVW0aZI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-10T18:41:01.000Z","id":"60ab69311a32480058f52e18"}]}}}
