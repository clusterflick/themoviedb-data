It is impossible not to be profoundly moved when confronting such immensity. But it is more than a chasm, it is alive with  mule deer, mountain lions, coyotes, bighorn sheep, wild turkeys, blue grouse, blue heron, desert tortoises, and the rare kaibab squirrel, found only in the Grand Canyon. Long before the Spanish arrived, the Anasazi (Ancient Ones) lived here. Included is an exclusive segment, never before filmed, of Shaman's Gallery, a significant Anasazi find of rock paintings in the Grand Canyon area, dating between 2000 B.C., and A.D 1. Established in 1908, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed the Grand Canyon a parkland and said \"do nothing to mar its grandeur, keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who will come after you.\"","popularity":0.2679,"poster_path":"/bZOPDqwIHIXNRlCulGFDlzhVaB5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trailwood Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":72120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Questar Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Astounding!
