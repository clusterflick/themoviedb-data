A group of students at Qinghua University who issued 2 big-character posters in May-June 1966 called themselves Red Guards. The students criticised the university administration of elitism and bourgeois tendencies.  In August 1966 Mao Zedong expressed support for the Red Guards. This gave the student movement political legitimacy and it spread outside Beijing.  The Red Guards started to attack the Four Olds and marched across China to eradicate old ideas, old cultures, old customs and old habits.  Ultimately the struggle between different Red Guard factions led to a chaotic civil-war-like situation. During 1967-68 the Peoples Liberation Army got the movement under control and restored social order.  Beginning late 1968 members of the Red Guard movement were sent to the countryside to undergo re-education. We met and filmed them in August 1971.","popularity":0.3283,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Guards after The Cultural Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dino Raymond Hansen","original_name":"Dino Raymond Hansen","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a1d03551e6ab0057dd9eb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349710,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gregers Nielsen","original_name":"Gregers Nielsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a1d04d8390180029f22583","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":478,"name":"china"},{"id":4004,"name":"cultural revolution"},{"id":263189,"name":"mao zedong"},{"id":280297,"name":"red guards"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
