This marked the beginning of shooting for a documentary called \"The Great Earthquake.\" The crew continued to shoot through the rest of 1988, even staging a large-scale rock 'n' roll concert and performance art event on the Great Wall, and into 1989, including footage shot at the famous 1989 Avant-Garde Art Exhibition, where one artist fired two gun shots at her exhibit. More footage was shot during the Tiananmen protests, up until the events of June 4th shut down production for good. Shortly before, a two-hour \"rough cut\" was assembled by main director Wen Pulin and Assistant Director Hao Zhiqiang, which screened only once (and is preserved at University libraries in the U.S.). The footage has been recycled in some of Wen's later films, notably \"China Action,\" but \"The Great Earthquake\" itself was never finished.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/pmUV4Wh1jEQVAeBXPSWp43w57W7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Earthquake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2326741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wen Pulin","original_name":"Wen Pulin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/n2DnyKuGwSmMiJd9ditrotStUwG.jpg","credit_id":"60a093fa2fccee0057267e72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yue Jiang","original_name":"Yue Jiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a956bd5a3b4e7c92dab422","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2687736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hao Zhiqiang","original_name":"Hao Zhiqiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c810f5787d82bae8ead506","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jinchuan Duan","original_name":"Jinchuan Duan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8110594dabbb04d5ece58","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmUV4Wh1jEQVAeBXPSWp43w57W7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1989-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
