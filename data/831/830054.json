The photographs taken by the architect Heide Moldenhauer, who worked for IBA, and various archival materials form the basis of the film. Nearly forty years after they were taken, Öğrenci finds the people in the photographs to hold interviews with them and displays the hidden history of Kreuzberg through the experiences and solidarity stories of women immigrants.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/bX0Chpuq6A978p2TcHqnYINrvp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abroad Is A Home Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esra Akçan","original_name":"Esra Akçan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60a03764924ce6006f4d2982","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pınar Öğrenci","original_name":"Pınar Öğrenci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9OUqMMblh26PRQPaJZHvRMfhMBe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60a0376d0f365500295f05d9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pınar Öğrenci","original_name":"Pınar Öğrenci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9OUqMMblh26PRQPaJZHvRMfhMBe.jpg","credit_id":"60a036c5b0ba7e00583def50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bX0Chpuq6A978p2TcHqnYINrvp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"40.
