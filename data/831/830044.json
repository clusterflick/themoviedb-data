Drawing on Moravian folklore, Janáček faithfully and deeply conveyed the drama of a peasant girl. The composer followed the path of Mussorgsky, revealing the spiritual life of people through the recreation of intonations of living speech. The libretto is based on a drama written in a naturalistic manner. Free from naturalism, Janáček's music has powerful emotional strength and psychological truth. It was written during a difficult period in the composer's life (illness and death of his daughter).","popularity":0.1153,"poster_path":"/g0JVJD8LAInoOEz6L1d3VJ1XkSH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Leos Janáček's Jenůfa performed at the Teatro Real, Madrid","title":"Janacek: Jenufa","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Roocroft","original_name":"Amanda Roocroft","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jenůfa","credit_id":"60a02fac924ce60029310df3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Polaski","original_name":"Deborah Polaski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kostelnička","credit_id":"60a02fb9924ce60058a86de4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2451100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miroslav Dvorský","original_name":"Miroslav Dvorský","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Laca Klemen","credit_id":"60a02fc66c1e0400443704c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Schukoff","original_name":"Nikolai Schukoff","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Števa Buryja","credit_id":"60a02fd4e635710079ee5c83","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mette Ejsing","original_name":"Mette Ejsing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Grandmother Buryjovka","credit_id":"60a02fec6c1e0400591cb52d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2573886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kàroly Szemerèdy","original_name":"Kàroly Szemerèdy","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Foreman of the mill","credit_id":"60a02ffc6c1e04007aab7fa4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Ferrández","original_name":"Sandra Ferrández","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Barena","credit_id":"60a030082fccee0029176827","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Braunschweig","original_name":"Stéphane Braunschweig","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a0301b8072980040173f62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivor Bolton","original_name":"Ivor Bolton","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/bdkL76voeiJzIMky1cEQWs8Klwp.jpg","credit_id":"60a03029839018005776ba14","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g0JVJD8LAInoOEz6L1d3VJ1XkSH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
