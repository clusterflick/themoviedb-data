Inside police found the bodies of two adults, later identified as Jen and Sarah Hart, and three children. From the very onset, it seemed more than a normal traffic accident, and it continued to be a confusing and shocking story - both for the local community and the online supporters who had followed the family’s adventures for years. They were known as a couple leading an idyllic life. Two white women who adopted six black children, promoting a core mission of activism, travel, and community service. As the story of the crash circulated, many began to wonder how this could have happened to a family like theirs, and if maybe the life they showed to the world, wasn’t exactly what it seemed.","popularity":0.2086,"poster_path":"/daAJdvsOuJk9KZgouxF2Ndb2Oy7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Harts","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1739942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Palmer","original_name":"Gregory Palmer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6319befdfac502007c3591c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2132119,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jon Vesey","original_name":"Jon Vesey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d52ca122df2e00df3cd260","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Allen Laws","original_name":"Allen Laws","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d52caac15b5500843b1351","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895139,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mark Smith","original_name":"Mark Smith","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d52cba22df2e00a0d94364","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895138,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shelton Mansfield","original_name":"Shelton Mansfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d52c9b20e6a500890c4913","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14638362","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d7zQ3C4y8V49jvj101OABIkg8YH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/daAJdvsOuJk9KZgouxF2Ndb2Oy7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/1mvbepBpEA0qf9efxAeG5ueie60.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Broken Harts | Now Streaming on discovery+","key":"VrKtu0UFI-g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-05-18T18:45:52.000Z","id":"61fd2b4a68929c0068b2a771"}]}}}
