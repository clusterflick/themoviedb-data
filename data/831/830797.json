I do not intend to respond to questions about political correctness, but also try to show the unsolved issues of art itself. What I care about is how they find enough channels between history, reality and the public. In short, my creation is the crystallization of personal complexity. As long as the perception that can be obtained through the idea, it can be regarded as a style in the development of my personality. All the warriors related to experience may become artistic associations. They are the result of profound meaning and endless reproduction. There is a mysterious place. ---Dean-E Mei's self-report","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sU7Zow3WtPRbfKU1xA73ydQ6ZJe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Formosa Filmmedia.co","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2012-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dean-E Mei: A Pungent Patriot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3094171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean-E Mei","original_name":"Dean-E Mei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a2ef109a9e20006f5dbb7c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ming-Chuan Huang","original_name":"Ming-Chuan Huang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pV5bJoIO2ICNiws71aID5f3L5GM.jpg","credit_id":"60a2ef1bb0ba7e003f6eed66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sU7Zow3WtPRbfKU1xA73ydQ6ZJe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
