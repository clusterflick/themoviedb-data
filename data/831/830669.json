Produced by the Crown Film Unit for the Ministry of Defence and the Admiralty in 1943, Close Quarters is an authentic impression of a routine wartime Royal Navy submarine patrol in the North Sea, off the coast of Norway.  At first the patrol is uneventful until HMS Tyrant comes across a U-boat. All the roles were performed by serving submariners (led by Lieutenant Commander Gregory) and much of the film was shot on a genuine British submarine which was still in service.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/mchcM9fPO1CoYZEfaWyNSncGTl4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1943-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Close Quarters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0221880","wikidata_id":"Q102126588","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1085,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mchcM9fPO1CoYZEfaWyNSncGTl4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
