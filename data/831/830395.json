Europe is at war, but without bluster.  On the city streets, as well as in the countryside, everyone pretends not to know or not to remember that.  There are international cooperations that “help” the poorest countries, leaving a fragrance of infinite dependency in the air.  This film speaks of this dependence and also of the “white” desire to have the cliched image of extreme African poverty.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mains propres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1989566,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louise Botkay","original_name":"Louise Botkay","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a184742fccee0040cc2014","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
