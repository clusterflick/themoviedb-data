Since then he has lived a mercurial existence; often caught between moments of glory and controversy as he continued to battle for his ideals. With the country knee-deep in a crushing financial crisis, Glezos is back in the limelight, elected as the oldest member of the European Parliament in 2014, at the age of 92. Yet he won't even discuss \"the flag incident\" refusing to be pigeonholed as a one-hit-wonder. Scolding, lecturing and joking along the way, he develops a tug-of-war relationship with the filmmakers, as they uncover the man behind the myth.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/ku2HlKx01kYExVhsCRUwnVRg2yg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Exile Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2018-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Partisan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Last Partisan","type":"International Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2687012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manolis Glezos","original_name":"Μανώλης Γλέζος","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mZwFATPNE6cRt1lqsayy0XmrHeN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6060ef660e64af0054102517","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2578448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Hadjipateras","original_name":"Andreas Hadjipateras","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060ef8353866e005265b835","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2957434,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teemu Takatalo","original_name":"Teemu Takatalo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060efd0b7b69d0054e14090","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Despina Pavlaki","original_name":"Despina Pavlaki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060efa84a52f80028154ca8","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2578448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Hadjipateras","original_name":"Andreas Hadjipateras","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060ef771f98d10028c57e4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2578448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Hadjipateras","original_name":"Andreas Hadjipateras","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060ef8d1f98d10028c57e78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718460,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hronis Theoharis","original_name":"Χρόνης Θεοχάρης","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060efc68f26bc002a679f31","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620619,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giannis Misouridis","original_name":"Giannis Misouridis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060efbb356a71003dd903c0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerie Kontakos","original_name":"Valerie Kontakos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060ef99b7b69d00753f2fea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488727,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pantelis Mantzanas","original_name":"Παντελής Μαντζανάς","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060efb24a52f8003f8d1915","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8223316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ku2HlKx01kYExVhsCRUwnVRg2yg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":952}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"20th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2018-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
