In this one-hour film Phillips dismantles and studies the movement from wood to dust, damp paper to mold, and ponders the house folding back into the land and sea. Phillips' performance constantly seeks evidence of dissolving boundaries, thingness, history and intersubjectivity of space, place and species. Through the poetics of the ruin \"The Quoddy Fold\" is an interrogation of dwelling and landscape giving space to entertain the ecological, cultural and societal anxieties surrounding impermanence.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jZXEwINbeg3JSiFEvLuo3pFJESz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quoddy Fold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulette Phillips","original_name":"Paulette Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f8f871b7c590054fff854","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulette Phillips","original_name":"Paulette Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60625b888d22fc0053df02a9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jZXEwINbeg3JSiFEvLuo3pFJESz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Internet","release_date":"2019-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2021-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
