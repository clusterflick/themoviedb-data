She graduated first in her class and returned home to serve as doctor to her Omaha tribe. During this heartbreaking and violent time she never gave up hope.  The reverberations from her shattered world continue today as Native Americans suffer from alarming rates of disease, suicide and mental illness. Like Susan, these modern day medicine women from the Omaha, Lakota and Navajo tribes are fighting a war and sharing a confident, even joyful, approach to the work of healing.","popularity":0.3457,"poster_path":"/cNEFXZVsWvAmfPfVFEboELZtPlS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116199,"logo_path":"/hjQ3Ue0YPisUfcHjn0AuC1TUeuM.png","name":"Nebraska Educational Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of America's First Native Medical Doctor","title":"Medicine Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Bedard","original_name":"Irene Bedard","popularity":0.6731,"profile_path":"/nCm5940cLixwcSoB5kIqLAKNmGL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Voice of Doctor Picotte (voice)","credit_id":"6061e94e1b7c59006b0ea156","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275045,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joy Harjo","original_name":"Joy Harjo","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/lcBbiH2HMZ7102l9dioU8ACOPBQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66a251a8a1fe12003672d8cd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Lesiak","original_name":"Christine Lesiak","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/njfpCWeRPUKetxYy01yWYdaLVb8.jpg","credit_id":"6061e9428f26bc0055a0da5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Lesiak","original_name":"Christine Lesiak","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/njfpCWeRPUKetxYy01yWYdaLVb8.jpg","credit_id":"66a244bbf7a114a083e100e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Lesiak","original_name":"Christine Lesiak","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/njfpCWeRPUKetxYy01yWYdaLVb8.jpg","credit_id":"66a244c881483e9ea180f2a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4849003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Princella P.
