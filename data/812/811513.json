The vast majority of these were plexiglass objects: most were sculptures although a few are formally closer to paintings. From a cinematic point of view one could describe the Optochromi sculptures as metaphysical colour animations frozen in time – so much so that modern composer Jan Wilhelm Morthenson made his film Interferences (1966), a tribute to 1920s abstraction à la Richter, with the use of Olson’s works. Gösta Werner did something similar five years earlier with Levande färg – only that he mainly circles the sculptures, and contemplates them more than he interacts with them. A respectfully curious distance is always kept.","popularity":0.1337,"poster_path":"/AsB1nsU1kCpZ7OaTjSFJKRifbY3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LIving Colour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gösta Werner","original_name":"Gösta Werner","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zslmBwrvCZUgGl9MVQevLqtSZsJ.jpg","credit_id":"6061652ff056d500282a87c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":898,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AsB1nsU1kCpZ7OaTjSFJKRifbY3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":598}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
