Delta Don, however, has the staying power of a good 70's pop tune. In spite of all odds, he inspires us to push harder, even if that takes us to the truck stops and rest areas along the I-75 in Georgia and Tennessee. A bittersweet, hummable comedy.","popularity":0.1189,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delta Don","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Mitchell","original_name":"Roy Mitchell","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6061864646f3540053580d9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
