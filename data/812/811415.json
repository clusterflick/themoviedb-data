Dressed in animal costumes, two people in an empty theatre switch between the roles of illness and patient, actor and audience, wolf and butterfly. The animals are associated with the illness, which the director has: lupus means wolf in Latin, whilst patients often have a 'butterfly rash.' With blue medical curtains paired with red velvet stage curtains, it echoes the uncomfortable feeling of being on show when in hospital.","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lupi Lupi Lu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Alcock","original_name":"Margaret Alcock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6060f2e255c1f40054a3d37c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Watson","original_name":"Scott Watson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6060f310e0ca7f0054a7e01f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028698,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aidan Teplitzky","original_name":"Aidan Teplitzky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060f220356a710028926db3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028704,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikita Gaidakov","original_name":"Nikita Gaidakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060f2b04a52f8006b55d730","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3028701,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kieran Colquhoun","original_name":"Kieran Colquhoun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060f25f6af9dd003eb93baf","department":"Camera","job":"Focus Puller"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028702,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jack Darrer","original_name":"Jack Darrer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060f2761b7c590054021298","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028703,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nathan Satin Silver","original_name":"Nathan Satin Silver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060f2911130bd006c803e30","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Castle","original_name":"Adam Castle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060f1d30b5fd6002aa2f6bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028699,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Cook","original_name":"Daniel Cook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060f23501b1ca00546b5c56","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
