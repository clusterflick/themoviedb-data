Shot from the interior of a room from which can be seen a plant, a person’s head, raindrops on the window, houses, the sea and the horizon. The point of focus and the film’s exposure are continually changed and are set into flux with each other while simultaneously the image is superimposed onto itself allowing even the slightest difference between sequences (of time and image) noticeable, bringing into question the very act and accuracy of cinematic depiction.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distancing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Gawthrop","original_name":"Rob Gawthrop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606152351365450054d180b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
