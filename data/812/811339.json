He resides in an old house with his elderly parents in a small town. It is as if the past memories of his ancestors lodged in his body. It is as if he were reincarnated. He finds it particularly difficult to sleep on rainy nights. On rainy nights memories of past lives awakes - his boyhood, his national past; his vision gets distorted, he couldn't help leaving the house. He seeks to escape from this troubled, hectic, suffocating modern world. He seeks peace on the paths, past memory ladened old walls, on the face of common people of this land,  ancient trees. This journey is to absolve his burdened parents, to emancipate himself. It is a journey into the void.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/5I0ha8cBl66ZAa3hCZ0YOKBZOJ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2997063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debashis Das","original_name":"Debashis Das","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060c5d26f6a99006afb4a12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akhteruzzaman Elias","original_name":"Akhteruzzaman Elias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060c61f1130bd00555d2fb7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2997063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debashis Das","original_name":"Debashis Das","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060c5ac356a710028922950","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2997063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debashis Das","original_name":"Debashis Das","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060c5c155c1f40029874f11","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2997063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debashis Das","original_name":"Debashis Das","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060c5e86f6a99003da40c92","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14344520","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5I0ha8cBl66ZAa3hCZ0YOKBZOJ6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dO97ecEoKKcb3NBzY35jidgXQC8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
