Through grainy Super 8 film and an immersive soundscape, the film shows that the making of a Toro Y Moi album is not always about grinding it out in a music studio. In this case, it’s about seclusion, proximity to nature, relaxation and even boredom. Through this process we witness Chaz endeavour to find the peace and purity at the core of his creativity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kQ76qGB3x6A8Qqrr5dAbYvhnLJI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creating Outer Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chaz Bear","original_name":"Chaz Bear","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"606098e28f26bc002a670a4e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tyler McPherron","original_name":"Tyler McPherron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606098fd0e64af00540f8c20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xFg8ZGAZD4dWR2nWXbdVYvK2Pe0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":809,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g8ndb9VHAFlMnr4P7SGgEbISKQe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kQ76qGB3x6A8Qqrr5dAbYvhnLJI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
