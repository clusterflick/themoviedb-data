Our society is obsessed with the car, with coming and going, getting somewhere. I used very intricate matting, some shaped like knives. I wanted the cars to slice each other in two, creating a kind of hurdy gurdy atmosphere…an abstract rushing to and fro, going nowhere. The first half of the film is silent. The second half, a grainy dupe of the same images, has sound and is far more urgent and aggressive.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.5786,"poster_path":"/szp2sWDXh6uhaEAA00U1Dhlxptk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cars","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Winkler","original_name":"Paul Winkler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/l9Z46PsCsfZWoehytV3iji3ccGD.jpg","credit_id":"606295ee27ff9900772d29be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wwwCTOmZw5mSDDMs3u9yiJmoNEK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kDPJ5ThUukucqw92Q6ShbpIdKSc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xiATayQO9aWoCPvFeg75387lGrp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u5kYyPLY6FUJEyI6ivufuSBNqqq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nU8wD1BmKkEylbpG2VGWCxV4tcl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kGOpaIUBzSUeyNzyMBL9kEIogEI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f63jXfqCsKbur4ttWwPIpTsFspl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pCC0Bg8hYO9bqJl1rJE6WzAOwpG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fyeKTk0FLjEzAWkJDe6qyAOFwu4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kyJLvgcJ4avyXt5Wv9so3zNs5ns.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gRyzHkGnfwqs4GLigvxFrNMtblV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/szp2sWDXh6uhaEAA00U1Dhlxptk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/60rDb2Wby1gpupNqWPyM2PBOJzr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
