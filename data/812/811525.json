She longs to know more but her Grandmother is silent. To find the story of her past, the Child enter the land of The In-between and travels to the beginning of time when Fairies roamed the earth. But the story she finds is not the one she wants. In a fit of anger she sends her Grandmother down into the sea to find the magic story she wishes for. Filled with remorse, she plunges into the sea to bring her back. As the Child sinks, the sleeping world of fairies begins to stir and the long lost secrets are awakened.  The Water’s Tale is a story of the interconnection between a woman and the past – herself as a child and the burden of history through the ages.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/1bCMe6P0ds8jnDbm805GqbG9yii.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Water's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Verrall","original_name":"Ann Verrall","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606174000b5fd60056ca6f50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029124,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Beaudry","original_name":"René Beaudry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60617549b7b69d003dcfea35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029115,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chuck Clark","original_name":"Chuck Clark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60617476b686b900282aebaf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Verrall","original_name":"Ann Verrall","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60617421e0ca7f006ab0c408","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029119,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jennifer Tilley","original_name":"Jennifer Tilley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606175071b7c5900288705a3","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029115,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chuck Clark","original_name":"Chuck Clark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606174587464570028976791","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029121,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"James Nicholson","original_name":"James Nicholson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6061752b6f6a99002862dcfa","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Verrall","original_name":"Ann Verrall","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60617432f056d500529e4bbc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2394532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Badessi","original_name":"Barbara Badessi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/1zpMfRnKsjnbjCMTu9zIfk9mkgt.jpg","credit_id":"60617469d1857200597d3778","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2605130,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Doug Porter","original_name":"Doug Porter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/teTSPCcXBesRCvMoNDBX0t3i6g.jpg","credit_id":"606174ebb7b69d00754012ce","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Verrall","original_name":"Ann Verrall","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60617440356a7100524e511c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384116,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sandy Moore","original_name":"Sandy Moore","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606175671b7c590028870656","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1bCMe6P0ds8jnDbm805GqbG9yii.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TWT - first 5 min.","key":"131609160","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-06-24T01:02:11.000Z","id":"606175baad50f0003d4dcfa4"}]}}}
