We start the journey from his home—an Ambulance parked outside a community centre—and venture across town to the local coffee shop.  We gain powerful insights from Andy as he weaves his way down the street, takes shortcuts through alleyways, runs through a forested ravine and skates uphill. \"It's the dead space I'm excited about.\" We observe how his attitude toward each spot—and every random encounter—brings them to life.","popularity":0.2677,"poster_path":"/mXQN8YtbLOWMzpiJMhoZTa4Zvul.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Powell Peralta","origin_country":""},{"id":151774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zenga Bros","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Many Worlds Are In Your World?","title":"Seen Him","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Anderson","original_name":"Andy Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6061fa791130bd0029aa3cbc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zenga Bros","original_name":"Zenga Bros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6061fa8de0ca7f003e9acf0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"zengabros","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m4PRZZlzFX9k6o03cE593XT8z57.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mXQN8YtbLOWMzpiJMhoZTa4Zvul.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":833}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":390,"name":"skateboarding"},{"id":2006,"name":"extreme sports"},{"id":274494,"name":"skateboard  video"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Powell-Peralta Presents: \"SEEN HIM\" a Zenga Bros Film Featuring Andy Anderson","key":"-bpsHh5nwe4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-25T16:00:00.000Z","id":"6061fb965c071b0074e92674"}]}}}
