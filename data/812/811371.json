His passion for animation began with The Simpsons and South Park. And while American TV series are generally created by huge studios, the distinctly recognizable characters that make up this whole absurdist world come from the hand of an amateur artist from a village in Khmelnytskyi oblast (province). Anatolii Surma never writes scripts for his cartoons. The ones he does write end up in the oven. This is a documentary about the author of the visual identity of Docudays UA Festival 2021 that reveals the secrets behind his creative process, the source of ideas and the inspiration for Anatolii Surma.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/e36p28C4k0juurzsw1XzFe58p0B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teofipol Welcomes Guests","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3028564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatolii Surma","original_name":"Anatolii Surma","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yQDpE7D3ZDuvFeKBvY0CuWbovRq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6060d3fca14bef00540ae87c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Bondarchuk","original_name":"Роман Бондарчук","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/bJhtE7H5rLr20pVT9d82RZOuSfm.jpg","credit_id":"6060d4121130bd0029a8b7ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1640026,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Baibakov","original_name":"Антон Байбаков","popularity":0.1704,"profile_path":"/jQuYDwWQVov8thY7xlBtWTg86Wj.jpg","credit_id":"6060d42b136545006a94f3bb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2030077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadym Ilkov","original_name":"Вадим Ільков","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/8sPl5WnobKBveN9xbhnFie7vjqT.jpg","credit_id":"6060d43e1b7c59003cd9a3e3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2195644,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrii Rohachov","original_name":"Andrii Rohachov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060d4531b7c59006b0d3083","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14342302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e36p28C4k0juurzsw1XzFe58p0B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"(virtual cinema) (Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival) ","release_date":"2021-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
