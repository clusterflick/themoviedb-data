Rather than choose to move to Lancaster County to finish raising them there herself, or let them be separated by the foster care system, Sarah decides to take them with her back to Portland where she believes she can make a new life for them. However, she soon realizes that the modern world has forced them to compromise who they are, and that she has moved them there for all the wrong reasons - a motive which is soon exposed - because secrets can really never be kept secret. In order to find her own redemption, she knows she must make a choice to give them back their lives in Amish Country. And whether she remains part of their lives will have a lot to do with how much she has grown to love them.","popularity":2.3355,"poster_path":"/A6s9fCd0cKkOuWBawFPOT4YoDyt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17669,"logo_path":"/rEkkdhNo0lS6jWW88iAEEGFvJGw.png","name":"Believe Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":78805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Redemption Films","origin_country":""},{"id":26574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faith for Today","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saving Sarah Cain","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Erlösung der Sarah Cain","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Un monde à part","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abigail Mason","original_name":"Abigail Mason","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lyddie Cottrell","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Pepper","original_name":"Lisa Pepper","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/cjwxRtmusgsymo6nvYcVf6kWkZJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sarah Cain","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fcf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Gould","original_name":"Elliott Gould","popularity":1.8493,"profile_path":"/vqjRBbuqXOvalAx5JZEaWx6kQOw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bill Alexander","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolanda Stange","original_name":"Yolanda Stange","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/12jOYy5HivapQb161JHYGPSkwvg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Norma","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer O'Dell","original_name":"Jennifer O'Dell","popularity":1.0095,"profile_path":"/fQ3nLCHfxj5hVsYQWSEA1ZeVzo7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Madison Miller","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fdb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Tate","original_name":"Tom Tate","popularity":0.1912,"profile_path":"/oWFfwZn0fjSAilGgVg34i2EdKty.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bryan Ford","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fdf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Nelson","original_name":"Carl Nelson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Waiter","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fe3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Markus","original_name":"Tom Markus","popularity":0.2072,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Bishop Stoltzfus","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113fe7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soren Fulton","original_name":"Soren Fulton","popularity":0.2566,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Caleb Cottrell","credit_id":"52fe46d2c3a36847f8113feb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle C.
