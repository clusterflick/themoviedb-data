Tormented by his ungrateful co-workers and trapped in a life of tedium as a welder in a local factory, Roman's one pleasure is his obsession with the elusive beauty (Kristen Bell) who lives in another apartment in his building complex. When a chance encounter with the young woman goes horribly wrong, a moment of frenzied desperation triggers a chilling turn of events leading to the girl's murder. As he teeters between deranged fantasy and cold reality, Roman's struggle to hide his grisly secret is further complicated by an eccentric neighbor named Eva (Nectar Rose) who develops an unlikely attraction to Roman and forces herself into his dark and tortured world.","popularity":0.7779,"poster_path":"/q37bd5zJoZATqSqEIScJxxI4Cyo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Auteur Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes Death Is Not So Natural","title":"Roman","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucky McKee","original_name":"Lucky McKee","popularity":0.2317,"profile_path":"/hmmtlOeOuBTAYsZo42KQQKWOwK3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Roman","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a36847f811252b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nectar Rose","original_name":"Nectar Rose","popularity":0.2621,"profile_path":"/xHTHeT2NpGoJ0UzlWP5LQN3L8O5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eva / Dream Girl","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a36847f811252f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Bell","original_name":"Kristen Bell","popularity":3.0379,"profile_path":"/rP74dJXl7EjinGM0shQtUOlH5s2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Isis / The Girl","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a36847f8112533","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucky McKee","original_name":"Lucky McKee","popularity":0.2317,"profile_path":"/hmmtlOeOuBTAYsZo42KQQKWOwK3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a36847f811253f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Bettis","original_name":"Angela Bettis","popularity":0.5499,"profile_path":"/4EntT31XmvVCKDI1XfWDEKlYgiq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a36847f8112539","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0454932","wikidata_id":"Q1401088","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bIAxyd6YcVmFXG7CZFFEIHSCA5w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q37bd5zJoZATqSqEIScJxxI4Cyo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ROMAN Trailer","key":"nMAx9YrNBeA","published_at":"2006-12-25T00:52:23.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6a5c3a36854480052e8"}]}}}
