At home, she's a loving mother, with two kids and a devoted husband, Frank (Michael Bowen), a fellow FBI agent. But her idyllic home life is shattered when a three-time loser she took down in a failed bank heist escapes from jail and vows revenge. Frank - is becoming increasingly irrational and distant after losing his job with the bureau. Theresa's former partner Danny McBaine (Brian Bloom) is seemingly the one relief valve in her ever-spiraling predicament. But can Danny help protect her from the madman who is stalking her - or will his presence only serve to inflame her husband's simmering paranoia and growing suspicions? The explosive climax threatens to sweep Theresa, her family, her life and her skills as a Hostage Negotiator to the very brink of terror in this edge-of-the-seat thriller!","popularity":1.7861,"poster_path":"/1laWIomtPCKG0yP1alStNlmODA2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nasser Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Former FBI Agent has to conduct the most important negotiation of her life.","title":"Hostage Negotiator","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail O'Grady","original_name":"Gail O'Grady","popularity":0.8034,"profile_path":"/5OrxiE9AHlLxIUrV06Us5voVY4j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Theresa Foley","credit_id":"52fe46d7c3a36847f81151b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bowen","original_name":"Michael Bowen","popularity":0.794,"profile_path":"/dYIzQQ4yozTIlpqJbmDkSyDd86C.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frank Foley","credit_id":"52fe46d7c3a36847f81151b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bloom","original_name":"Brian Bloom","popularity":0.9474,"profile_path":"/9mZKhI3aVbzZ5Xq43n7fGzWAqi0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Danny McBaine","credit_id":"52fe46d7c3a36847f81151bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don S.
