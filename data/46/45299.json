Discussing an issue the BBC calls \"as fierce as ever,\" the two go head to head in a remarkable match of intellect. Holding the Atheistic position is Prof. Richard Dawkins, celebrated author of The God Delusion and regarded by many as the spokesman for the \"New Atheism.\" Opposing Dawkins is fellow Oxford professor John Lennox. Lennox, like Dawkins, has dedicated his career to science, but arrives at very different conclusions.","popularity":0.336,"poster_path":"/7Vsz6MOIsRiRmeEUMbDgabdUJph.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawkins vs Lennox: Has Science Buried God?","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dawkins vs Lennox: Has Science Buried God?","type":"Alternate"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dawkins","original_name":"Richard Dawkins","popularity":0.4353,"profile_path":"/eHM9PMTDmdtwsfjFVC8S0ugd7rn.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f299","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennox","original_name":"John Lennox","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/alMn6WMUvl3TIsPNU7lJE9N9h44.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f29d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132867,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Woodbridge","original_name":"David Woodbridge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f277","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carson Lennox","original_name":"Carson Lennox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f28f","department":"Production","job":"Location Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132870,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael Bradshaw","original_name":"Michael Bradshaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f289","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Lennox","original_name":"Michael Lennox","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f265","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carson Lennox","original_name":"Carson Lennox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f295","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132864,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Taunton","original_name":"Larry Taunton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f26b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132869,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary Warmington","original_name":"Gary Warmington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f283","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132866,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ryan Kernaghan","original_name":"Ryan Kernaghan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f271","department":"Crew","job":"Lighting Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132868,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles Beasley","original_name":"Charles Beasley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bbc3a36847f810f27d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2379700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1070,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7Vsz6MOIsRiRmeEUMbDgabdUJph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":758},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l3qUJXcHwcdkHkauwk5Kot3jMbE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
