Always a strong, charismatic singer, McLachlan now conjures a rare balance of delicacy and power, measured here in performances of signature songs that add a new, more muscular edge matching her band's rock firepower. Thus, \"Possession\" expands beyond its already sensual promise to touch on truly erotic abandon, while \"Building a Mystery\" focuses its portrait of a narcissistic poseur with a harder edge and a newly amended, R-rated lyric that's entirely appropriate.","popularity":0.3401,"poster_path":"/oS8bx0MlInnhAypbKZeI4aLPJJT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sarah McLachlan Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":93295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oil Factory Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sarah McLachlan: Mirrorball","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"SARAH MCLACHLAN MIRRORBALL","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah McLachlan","original_name":"Sarah McLachlan","popularity":0.35,"profile_path":"/90cgoecmN8sRPe5ch9qTeQqrpPl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself -
