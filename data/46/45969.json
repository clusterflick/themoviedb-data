The latest installment of the adrenaline-packed Ghost Rider series features incredible on-board footage from the highways of Sweden and busy streets of Stockholm. Join Ghost Rider as he weaves through traffic, rides the Nurburgring, \"off-roads\" in a city center, goes sledging without snow and comes within seconds of disaster during unexpected encounters with a police van and a huge lorry! Ghost Rider swaps two wheels for four as he burns rubber in a high performance Subaru, showing he has skill and style whatever the machine. All the way the Swedish police are on his tail, the pursuits captured from incredible on-board camera angles and shown in split screen - so you can see what's ahead as you leave the pursuers behind. Plus, Ghost Rider finally agrees to take on a street race, with his bike at stake as well as his pride.","popularity":0.483,"poster_path":"/qtkkFsrqqsqOvdMdEIQ1eJCtLy8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Rider 5 Back To Basics","video":false,"vote_average":9.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ghostrider 5 - Back To Basics","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":114851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ghost Rider","original_name":"Ghost Rider","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ghost Rider","credit_id":"52fe46dcc3a36847f81166b1","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pI9qxggnhQya05wrq0qbZRwlA5v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4KMMIPKN4nasbMc8lY6C78t3e6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mf1lWCFzsCTNvkgQq1Yp2cER8SO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/209F6mvb75F2K5CsWDX4FhfbFtr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cL06tBBweUyLSj1SnbALkKq3f1B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qtkkFsrqqsqOvdMdEIQ1eJCtLy8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eVMGM3uu8YKBAecqGDTEN9ubA7p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":608}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":167043,"name":"road movie"},{"id":195295,"name":"motorcycle chase"},{"id":242128,"name":"motorsport"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ghost Rider 5 Back To Basics trailer 2","key":"wO7Bc4HGAM8","published_at":"2008-01-01T14:39:27.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6a5c3a368544800536b"}]}}}
