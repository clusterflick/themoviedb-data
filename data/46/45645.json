Known worldwide as a pioneer of women’s professional surfing, in the Islands Rell Sunn achieved the stature of an icon — not only for her physical power, grace and luminous beauty, but for her leadership in a community that loved her as much as she loved it. Named one of Hawai’i’s most influential women of the 20th century by ABC television, Sunn - whose Hawaiian name means Heart of the Sea - was eulogized in the New York Times for having “captured the heart of Hawai’i during a 14-year battle with cancer.”","popularity":0.1837,"poster_path":"/dK5phdiwXtS4r4C4Zkm9FDLPRTo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart of the Sea: Kapolioka'ehukai","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rell Sunn","original_name":"Rell Sunn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe46ccc3a36847f8112da9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Lagarde","original_name":"Charlotte Lagarde","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46ccc3a36847f8112d8d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133395,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lisa Denker","original_name":"Lisa Denker","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46ccc3a36847f8112d93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Lagarde","original_name":"Charlotte Lagarde","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46ccc3a36847f8112d99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133395,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lisa Denker","original_name":"Lisa Denker","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46ccc3a36847f8112d9f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janet Cole","original_name":"Janet Cole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46ccc3a36847f8112da5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lora Hirschberg","original_name":"Lora Hirschberg","popularity":0.2312,"profile_path":"/8IJl1itNV99LhKg24yeIGHjYaQd.jpg","credit_id":"66d8ee820c711cc77429e8c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lora Hirschberg","original_name":"Lora Hirschberg","popularity":0.2312,"profile_path":"/8IJl1itNV99LhKg24yeIGHjYaQd.jpg","credit_id":"66d8ee8d779e1ff192bf56a1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0366560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1005,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dK5phdiwXtS4r4C4Zkm9FDLPRTo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":670}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Heart of the Sea - New Day Films - Native Hawaiian and Indigenous Studies - Women's Studies","key":"ub2JKfM32wY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2014-07-17T15:06:54.000Z","id":"5f838b9a028420003718447e"}]}}}
