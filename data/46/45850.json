Tinseltown. Sin City. A town that's built its reputation on money, power and sex. A typical talent agent, Simon Teller is no different that the rest of the Hollywood elite. He'll do anything to seal a deal. And he and his starlet fiancee, Lacy Lloyd, like to push the envelope of their sexual boundaries. They get off by video-taping their erotic indiscretions with other men and women and watching them together. But eventually Simon picks the wrong woman to fool around with. When Donna, the sultry conniving wife of the agency's CEO, seduces and then black-mails him, he'll have to summon more than the usual tricks to land on his feet.","popularity":0.8741,"poster_path":"/x82fTxv6PuXXKyklRnGSWcIx84K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mystique Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The steamiest stories take place behind the camera","title":"Hollywood Sins","video":false,"vote_average":3.25,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Pecados de Hollywood","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Vices à Hollywood","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Hollywoodi erkölcsök","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Hollywood Günahlari","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Love's Hidden Talent","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Carroll","original_name":"Justin Carroll","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/22YmDRefx6zFANsQWhAftBbTC60.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Simon Teller","credit_id":"5c11b92692514147921022f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Dawson","original_name":"Kim Dawson","popularity":0.857,"profile_path":"/e2xUZkAPb2Ep3iYcR9KPoFVSWU2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Donna Silverstein","credit_id":"52fe46d6c3a36847f811508f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Acsell","original_name":"Eric Acsell","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/dfB8MmtuMskzN5O88Mu98rGFtc2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"52fe46d6c3a36847f8115093","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Zottoli","original_name":"Mia Zottoli","popularity":0.4392,"profile_path":"/yzTlBYLI02dJNvzBG5kIFr3PzR1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lacy Lloyd","credit_id":"52fe46d6c3a36847f8115097","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":174551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tess Broussard","original_name":"Tess Broussard","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/4yY6VnEetm42HbSQlchTv3PdJEw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Debbie","credit_id":"5c11b946c3a3682b4aeea247","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":42246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Avalon","original_name":"Jennifer Avalon","popularity":19.585,"profile_path":"/r65k0filKJW1ymF5BXfwjUB3lyK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kayleen","credit_id":"52fe46d6c3a36847f811509b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":138674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginger Justin","original_name":"Ginger Justin","popularity":0.158,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Lillian","credit_id":"5c11b9770e0a2638af119cd6","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":222411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicca","original_name":"Vicca","popularity":8.319,"profile_path":"/rp1gbyjvR8YUPc1P6gkOOmAp1j.jpg","cast_id":31,"character":"Linda","credit_id":"62ad6c03d2b2090051b1d33d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Muser","original_name":"Wolf Muser","popularity":0.3337,"profile_path":"/pjtffZMshARfyYvFdFJrPqykkXl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"David","credit_id":"5c11b9570e0a2638bc10f181","order":8},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":997589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee","original_name":"Dee","popularity":3.177,"profile_path":"/gqQBTR9n67H25524wCfb7Uw4MWk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ashley","credit_id":"5c11b9600e0a2638b810f5de","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Hajdu","original_name":"Steve Hajdu","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/AaS457shYfKSoLSTajkipwcFZzz.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46d6c3a36847f8115087","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Holzman","original_name":"Edward Holzman","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46d6c3a36847f8115081","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diane Laney","original_name":"Diane Laney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6265a5be1d820f00500d815b","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darren B.
