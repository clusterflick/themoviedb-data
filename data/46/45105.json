Somewhere along the line in all action sports it became uncool to show how stoked you were when you did something sick. What's that all about?

A truly epic film shot in the most amazing locations, featuring the best and boldest skiers in the world today.","popularity":0.0697,"poster_path":"/cLbeG7rtBwhBqgR2lW01kcsjs93.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3755,"logo_path":"/krZgEDPup3ejRjIpGBtmK49jzSc.png","name":"Matchstick Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Greatest Ski Movie...
