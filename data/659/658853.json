Now, experts at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History are meticulously conserving this fragile volume, page by brittle page. Along the way, they discover subtle hidden clues to Jefferson himself.","popularity":0.0526,"poster_path":"/4djKcs60fVjgRIhYJQzkPmLirlH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jefferson's Secret Bible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2282825","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/waq1CaWj809V43OvFhK8oYDeoSR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4djKcs60fVjgRIhYJQzkPmLirlH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
