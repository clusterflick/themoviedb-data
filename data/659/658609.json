The DVD also includes the previously unseen Blue Screen versions of Jeepster and Life’s A Gas from Germany’s Beat Club plus the actual broadcast versions of Jeepster and Life’s A Gas. The rarely seen official promo videos for Get It On and Jeepster are also included, plus live performances of Girl and Cosmic Dancer which were recorded at the performance of T. Rex’s historic Wembley Empire Pool concerts on March 18 1972.  These were not included in the concert film Born To Boogie (which used none of the matinée concert footage).","popularity":0.3428,"poster_path":"/gvEaGwYxc3MP5K7OE5zGmk1gHb5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74382,"logo_path":"/3W1gOKEbPfvL0O0tEusVvYuI8Ju.png","name":"A&M Records","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4614,"logo_path":null,"name":"A&M Sound Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":11043,"logo_path":null,"name":"A&M Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":49782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal/Music/DVD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"T-Rex: Electric Warrior","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1237916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Bolan","original_name":"Marc Bolan","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/slAN2KMEPMSYJL8OeKkzfyAGOTo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e06b42d4c1d9a0015e063c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2492134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Finn","original_name":"Mickey Finn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e06b468278d8a001367d19e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2492135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Currie","original_name":"Steve Currie","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e06b4784c1d9a0019e047f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2492136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Legend","original_name":"Bill Legend","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e06b487223a8b0015ad3299","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elton John","original_name":"Elton John","popularity":0.9181,"profile_path":"/9G3k29OWPyZtScEDZEAsFJpqiM7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e06b4f3d236e600129cdbf6","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gvEaGwYxc3MP5K7OE5zGmk1gHb5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5699,"name":"music video"},{"id":12197,"name":"compilation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
