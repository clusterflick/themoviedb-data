Did he fake his own death, or do doppelgangers really exist?  A mysterious call, a photograph of a man and a private detective compelled by the one case that has finally got to him. One stark but brilliant day in London, Austin Peterson takes a job from an anonymous client, a demand he knows he should refuse. He uses the feelings of the woman who loves him to get information. But this only raises more questions than it answers, leading Petersen deeper into the maze.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/gQRAwhKopUjgW14C7sI2PteQAr4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126973,"logo_path":null,"name":"BrownCrowe Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Met Himself","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Crowe","original_name":"Dan Crowe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Austin Petersson, Private Eye","credit_id":"5e05f3cad7dcd20012f84e4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siubhan Harrison","original_name":"Siubhan Harrison","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/wdHgNUzLxdHZcNTu77jtDAkNQFf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Faye","credit_id":"5e05f3db26dac100176f8616","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Brown","original_name":"James Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The client","credit_id":"5e05f3f288c659001628a684","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Donovan","original_name":"Lucy Donovan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"5e05f406d7dcd20017f84e8a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silas Hawkins","original_name":"Silas Hawkins","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Maker (voice)","credit_id":"5e05f4249bcd0f001a0db6bf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wontner","original_name":"Tom Wontner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3LvNe2Ct75WQ1xsG9pg97qyvlXR.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Michael (voice)","credit_id":"5e0623f19bcd0f001a0e650b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1083178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennie Lathan","original_name":"Jennie Lathan","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/AsK3FwD75c4yfxIs93yYz1f38Hm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Maker (voice)","credit_id":"5e06240688c6590011296639","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Trestain","original_name":"Richard Trestain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Officer Bell (voice)","credit_id":"5e06241beda4b7001229ac39","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Crowe","original_name":"Ben Crowe","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e05f443d236e600129b247b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Crowe","original_name":"Ben Crowe","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e05f44cd7dcd20012f8568b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Crowe","original_name":"Ben Crowe","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e05f45c4c1d9a0015de8c3a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491635,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Preti Taneja","original_name":"Preti Taneja","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e05f46bd7dcd20014f84f9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491636,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Bartlett","original_name":"Oliver Bartlett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e05f481d7dcd20014f84fb3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0458422","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gQRAwhKopUjgW14C7sI2PteQAr4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
