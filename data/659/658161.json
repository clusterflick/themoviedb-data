How will Claudine and Maxime react?  Turnarounds, an inimitable sense of dialogue make this comedy the feeling of back to school.  How easy it is to be tolerant when you are not involved yourself!  Because when Claudine and Maxime, an open-minded couple, who even demonstrated for marriage for all, come across, by leafing through a celebrity newspaper, on a photo of their son in the company of a man, the sky plummets them. the head.  Claudine, more benevolent, tries to reason with her husband, but he finds it difficult to digest the news.  Each in turn, the mother and father will question themselves, question themselves, and try to face this revelation, which cannot alter the love they have for their child.","popularity":0.1425,"poster_path":"/hzsUi6KcmaG5QObH3gry7KDizxY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pourvu qu'il soit heureux","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Huster","original_name":"Francis Huster","popularity":0.7048,"profile_path":"/v2q1DoC8HPOKzo8uRpllC7nnRhQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maxime","credit_id":"5e0484c80284200019b6e364","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Cottençon","original_name":"Fanny Cottençon","popularity":0.2954,"profile_path":"/9uRzXYEgsDvdxRfT8F6cRFPAgdh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Claudine","credit_id":"5e0484d44c1d9a0019dba536","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2490866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis le Barazer","original_name":"Louis le Barazer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AslK5hW19zes9WRTDeuKVTDoZkN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Camille","credit_id":"5e0484e226dac100176ccc0a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Khalfon","original_name":"Serge Khalfon","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":"/hTaUfZ8r47TxfxtF5JtX1O6Mr4P.jpg","credit_id":"5e0484a826dac100176ccbb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":964932,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Laurent Ruquier","original_name":"Laurent Ruquier","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":"/tkSFPAugX6SscalzmEjsNp3c95E.jpg","credit_id":"67966523c7b01b72c723df63","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7uLyTg3a2xh0nqn3yQ7MOD75Ar9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1284,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hzsUi6KcmaG5QObH3gry7KDizxY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":864}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
