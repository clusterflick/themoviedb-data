He bought a ring and pre-booked a table in a restaurant and, it seems, almost does not doubt the correctness of his decision. But on the right day, Sasha didn’t voluntarily linger on the set and was therefore forced to hurry terribly. In his car, he drives to the chosen one and rehearses the speech of the sentence, reflects on how to present the ring more correctly and what to say. During the rehearsal of the speech, Sasha suddenly realizes that she does not want to get married and must leave Marina.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/vnJsz6gfhbXXKz05DnEH8ohynfc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116840,"logo_path":"/91bcb9YuxXMWgPIKV0Wzn8ai6gD.png","name":"Industry Film School","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Предложение","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Predlozhenie","type":"Transilteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgiy Kudrenko","original_name":"Георгий Кудренко","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/cxNsp9ZxEoWgEIRMncMEXNmyDAR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sasha","credit_id":"5e066d68223a8b0018acd13d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1998058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniya Vays","original_name":"Евгения Вайс","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":"/iGHUXDbTTIHTIYj3O44loL4MOab.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Masha","credit_id":"5e066d6ef495ee0012eab9f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2002085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Muravyov","original_name":"Сергей Муравьёв","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":"/6nSsfsHMYaePM6JYp28aE2BAzYL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"director","credit_id":"5e066d74223a8b0013ace6b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2052879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artem Shevchenko","original_name":"Артем Шевченко","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/bJQrPvwrpVHxWnY0VhqaB9QABte.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sasha's friend","credit_id":"5e066d8b9bcd0f00150f286e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2283979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrey Rebenkov","original_name":"Андрей Ребенков","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/yxuMawRZn6rXrJ8BEPi5MmDWhUl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"traffic police inspector","credit_id":"5e066e2d4c1d9a0015e00150","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2491976,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Mariya Antonchik","original_name":"Mariya Antonchik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e06766b88c659001129d02b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2491958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Pozdnyakov","original_name":"Andrey Pozdnyakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e066e47eda4b700172a0be3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2491959,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrey Kapetsky","original_name":"Andrey Kapetsky","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e066e6c9bcd0f00170f4e65","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400569,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexey Kazakov","original_name":"Алексей Казаков","popularity":0.32,"profile_path":"/8NXun3tDrYXolbKQCbh3RvOvC7Q.jpg","credit_id":"5e067024d7dcd20017f9935d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2491960,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boris Korostyshevsky","original_name":"Boris Korostyshevsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e066e9a11386c0014c9b013","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztmHSz9qqsdmxhz4bjvrOV9lI7i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/vnJsz6gfhbXXKz05DnEH8ohynfc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
