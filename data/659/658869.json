Terry Ghusto is the returning émigré moving in with his brother-in-law, newly unemployed road-sweeper Bobby Channels, while attempting to make a name for himself in local politics. The film follows the varying fortunes of the two, as Terry's high-flying pretensions come into sharp conflict with Bobby's own more humble voyage of self-discovery.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film exercising our non-existent democratic freedom","title":"Shamrocracy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Canavan Hayes","original_name":"Laura Canavan Hayes","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Laura Fox","credit_id":"64307533310325009a20f6bb","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2427114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Shamrocracy","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"terryghusto"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
