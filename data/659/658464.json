The show is an archaic study of passion, a sacrifice of bodies that do not deny their fluids: sweat, saliva, blood. With a dramaturgy organized in paintings, Wolf can be considered a moving painting. Performers form a chorus of crowd into extreme existence, in an unbridled sequence of actions / images: they run, fall to the ground, have sex with each other and recite Emily Dickinson's poems. The montage circulates in several languages, articulating text, dance, performance and theater.","popularity":0.1829,"poster_path":"/tkGgHFQiv2hPQPzX2vydNwLdDYU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1836659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Bianchi","original_name":"Carolina Bianchi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/gIrjOGCvJrdCJctnMzxeLxdw19o.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e05fec9eda4b7001429678b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1836659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Bianchi","original_name":"Carolina Bianchi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/gIrjOGCvJrdCJctnMzxeLxdw19o.jpg","credit_id":"5e05fde5eda4b70014294e8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491677,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cara de Cavalo","original_name":"Cara de Cavalo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0602d2d236e600129b8bce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l1ZbLH2HiFFq3CKKhPj61DdaFRA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tkGgHFQiv2hPQPzX2vydNwLdDYU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fadyCvwd4l94bkoNlpzriz5WOOB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MITsp 2019 | Lobo","key":"iMHLE2WohG4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-19T21:06:10.000Z","id":"5e05fdb5eda4b70014294c2e"}]}}}
