In Mrs. Smith's enrichment class they put away textbooks and learn to question the ordinary, take risks and solve problems themselves. With no interviews or commentary over a seven-month arc, it's a chance to observe the emerging personalities and natural drama of eight 10-year-olds. It's a heartfelt fifth-grade experience of creativity, frustration, hilarity and triumph.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sitting Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Hunt","original_name":"Paul Hunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e70e5d2f9aa470015cef16d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Kauffman","original_name":"Julie Kauffman","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e70e5e1b1f68d0014db1f52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1480688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
