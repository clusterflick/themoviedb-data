The filmmakers own families are battlegrounds over loyalty to Israel, interpretations of the Holocaust, intermarriage and a conversion to Islam, and a secret communist past. Filmed in the United States and Israel, this first person documentary begins with a near riot at a Jewish Film Festival in San Francisco, shows an agonizing battle over divestment from Israel on a university campus, and reveals how hard it is for minorities in America to maintain ethnic identity in the face of generational change. Who speaks for a divided community at the crossroads? 'Between Two Worlds' has the exhilarating energy and fierce commitment of Jewish conversation itself.","popularity":0.1697,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Two Worlds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fred Frith","original_name":"Fred Frith","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/ldqW8zj9lCakZYsy4Zd1qTJVjkF.jpg","credit_id":"623558c2df29450079a4ec03","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454558,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kenji Yamamoto","original_name":"Kenji Yamamoto","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623558fe8e8d3000783fd0ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1781502,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marsha Kahm","original_name":"Marsha Kahm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6235583a34e152001cc6c0cc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2062084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Kaufman","original_name":"Deborah Kaufman","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e70eeb3cabfe4001517eb66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2062085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Snitow","original_name":"Alan Snitow","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e70eebecabfe40011184a75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1956441","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
