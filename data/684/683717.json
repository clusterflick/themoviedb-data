It's about the meeting of two men and women. It's a bit like a road movie. The first person to show up was Alan (Liu Yali), a cashier in a bar on the Hong Kong Shenzhen highway. She watched people coming and going, and seemed to be familiar with each other, but she was not familiar with each other. She only felt deeply for the container truck driver, ah Chun (Lu Huiguang), and believed that he was the one who took her away from this boring world. On the other side, cat (Li Huimin), who has become a prostitute, wants to sell her body and mind in exchange for a sum of money so that she can leave this ugly world. But Danny, the groom who supervises her, disillusioned her desire. Because of their long-standing relationship, Danny was in huge debt. Every penny cat earned paid his gambling debt. However, in a dark night, they resolutely embarked on the road of no return.","popularity":0.1816,"poster_path":"/tyVMJ69qsLFrhlhJFuCiUDyNcr1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1996-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Movie Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":224928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Lee Wai-Man","original_name":"李蕙敏","popularity":0.3385,"profile_path":"/iA5hOdOMMSG3YeuynLteucoa3Pe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cat","credit_id":"5e6fb41aa097dc001518a0a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moses Chan Ho","original_name":"陳豪","popularity":0.9418,"profile_path":"/gvZcLkr1GMPajHROKd7rqzYWQbj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Brother Man","credit_id":"5e6fb4274f9a99001151cce1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2568226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Lau","original_name":"Alice Lau","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lorna","credit_id":"5e6fb436cedac400154ddda3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Lo Wai-Kwong","original_name":"盧惠光","popularity":0.7734,"profile_path":"/aecWmrSbnZTTnBJ8vgyNAaphOLp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Chun","credit_id":"5e6fb443cabfe4001116f5ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Chan Lung","original_name":"陳龍","popularity":0.5916,"profile_path":"/couTpPFlMcd5B9EAFB3Vx5dchUJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kwong","credit_id":"5e6fb451cabfe400151687fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lam Suet","original_name":"林雪","popularity":0.8732,"profile_path":"/5ZvphtA3dwsDu81lF3TV8rIwt4l.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"646fc61f5437f500c327cab2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wu Ma","original_name":"午馬","popularity":0.8702,"profile_path":"/zfvulEXVw72RAf4OkOdkykDnqUH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64f82529ffc9de00c4a1ad17","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Hon Kwan","original_name":"Victor Hon Kwan","popularity":0.1022,"profile_path":"/ohZCzpQwVizynmZGpqUOrahnmQH.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"657eb77c48333a3d49cb027b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chan Chi-Fai","original_name":"Chan Chi-Fai","popularity":0.1445,"profile_path":"/r7eyb8VATUMfB8h30wV97Cq8oDV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65cd018a894ed60163277795","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Yip Wing-Cho","original_name":"叶荣祖","popularity":0.4797,"profile_path":"/tfJWAnUqq312lO64fEP7jVP8MPl.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"65e3c925a672540162a8d0d8","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3054460,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Maggie Choy Yin-Ching","original_name":"蔡彥菁","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6344072bb7a154007cc6f743","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sze Mei-Yee","original_name":"Sze Mei-Yee","popularity":0.2571,"profile_path":"/AnOAC41KgtJNam3MUlto9kpM6Lc.jpg","credit_id":"5e6fb3ec2f3b1700174634a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sharon Hui","original_name":"Sharon Hui","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6fb3fbb1f68d0019d9d06f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":777,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tyVMJ69qsLFrhlhJFuCiUDyNcr1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
