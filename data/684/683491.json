In order to get out of his confinement, he accepts a job from the Jerusalem post office, unaware that it is for a very special division: The Department of Letters to God. Through the letters sent by people from all over the world, Moshe will face humanity in its most secret privacy, sometimes most fanciful wishes. He doesn't believe in anything anymore but a series of strange events will transform his bitterness and lead him to discover how forgiveness can reconcile him with his wife and bring him peace again.","popularity":0.4241,"poster_path":"/xuKf93hKdboTwTeiPCIULSrzuVh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters to God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Michtavim le Elohim","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Lettres a Dieu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reymonde Amsallem","original_name":"Reymonde Amsallem","popularity":0.2667,"profile_path":"/79G5CHsOHHbfvDqXu99RzzDTCVB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e6e8686cedac400154c956c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uri Klauzner","original_name":"Uri Klauzner","popularity":0.1142,"profile_path":"/9pSo0leamZkW2BNjDonMJG0B2uk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e6e868ecedac400134c7e27","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092920,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tal Keller","original_name":"Tal Keller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645f6f34e3fa2f01662079b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2332894,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniella Nowitz","original_name":"Daniella Nowitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645f6f2edbbb420170a83b9e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Cohen","original_name":"Yves Cohen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6e8654b1f68d0014d85917","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Cohen","original_name":"Yves Cohen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6e864ccedac400194ca730","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5116860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Blanco","original_name":"David Blanco","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c4cd2c27f1565f579f0e4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10481952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"letterstogodyvescohen","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xuKf93hKdboTwTeiPCIULSrzuVh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3575,"name":"jerusalem"},{"id":164881,"name":"death of daughter"},{"id":262205,"name":"letters"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
