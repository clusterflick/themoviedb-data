Chiara Stella, Domenico and Alessio are all 15 years old and every Monday they go to theatre classes at the Centro Asterix, a recreational space with a small theatre, located in San Giovanni in Teduccio, a district in the eastern suburbs of Naples.  The film closely follows the relationships between the children and their teachers; Nicola encourages the children to look into themselves and find ways of facing life with a conscious and above all calm approach. The stories, the needs and personalities of Chiara Stella, Domenico and Alessio emerge through crises, successes and reflection; they open up to each other thanks to the methods and direction of Nicola and through improvisation on the stage. The theatre thus becomes a space for discussion and self-analysis.","popularity":0.0914,"poster_path":"/hwhLqTTfkFdUkVb1wF9OuVyBqDk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88415,"logo_path":"/eILTlrcolO64UUvODgfKtvgNLcH.png","name":"Parallelo 41","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“It can’t always be summer\" is a documentary that examines the development of a group of teenage kids from the outskirts of Naples and their involvement in a theatre group.","title":"It can't always be summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601251,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Saitta","original_name":"Marco Saitta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616811e55cea18002612e5c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2566158,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simona Infante","original_name":"Simona Infante","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6cfda2459ad600136453cc","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2566158,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simona Infante","original_name":"Simona Infante","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6cfd30a9b9a40012a05985","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2566156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Iannucci","original_name":"Sabrina Iannucci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/miIt5MjQNFqSSNn58IZmCFhMJCn.jpg","credit_id":"5e6cfd02357c000019424281","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2566157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margherita Panizon","original_name":"Margherita Panizon","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/z2gczdHySnQrTioimqdQqpcaZCl.jpg","credit_id":"5e6cfd1dcabfe40011137acc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1405,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hwhLqTTfkFdUkVb1wF9OuVyBqDk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
