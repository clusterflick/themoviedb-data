I spent several weeks working with this camera and found that its mechanics were marvelously thought out and that the way the camera was made was proof of the skilled craftsmanship back then. I developed a procedure which also allowed me to use the camera as a printing machine. The printing process is not so different from the filming process, as far as the transport of the film goes . . . It was a lot of fun to try to exhaust the possibilities of the Debrie. It was not only the mechanics that were exciting, like the works of a wonderful old clock, but the numerous possibilities for the realization of the second part of the film, too. This consists mainly of what has already been shot, but offers at least 50% more experimental manipulations in the printed part.\" (HHK)","popularity":0.0582,"poster_path":"/oPm3N9OrCjNjSKav03qv7xLP3ED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1971-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wrecked Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raphaela Schoenherr","original_name":"Raphaela Schoenherr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e6f90232f3b170011465b09","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e6f903fcedac400194df511","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e6f9046cedac400194df51a","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e6f904d2f3b17001946e6ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e6f90544f9a99001351d78f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e6f9065cabfe400151667c7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPm3N9OrCjNjSKav03qv7xLP3ED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Planken Lichtspiele, Grosses Haus, Mannheim","release_date":"1971-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
