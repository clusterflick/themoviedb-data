His marriage has collapsed; he is without a job; and his father has just died. There is no reality, only an indistinguishable mixture of images and moments drawn from some space in time that could be his past, his present, or his future.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":"/rEO3pwVzPzXDJS5uYPqsa1lhQ67.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winter There Was Very Little Snow","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Max","credit_id":"5e6d3f94459ad600136495e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gracie Kiley","original_name":"Gracie Kiley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Louise","credit_id":"6063cf090b5fd600764739ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Donahue","original_name":"Andrea Donahue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Margaret","credit_id":"6063cf188f26bc0055a410cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Nuner","original_name":"Robert Nuner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"6063cf31d6d64d003e2bb861","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Ungerer","original_name":"Irene Ungerer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"606410fe46f35400281889c8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Ungerer","original_name":"Max Ungerer","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6064110e46f3540069f032f5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6063cf760fb398003dd470ba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6063cf94db8a00003c1cc745","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6d3ff0cabfe4001513a6df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3257484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.743,"height":1345,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rEO3pwVzPzXDJS5uYPqsa1lhQ67.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
