To us, it looks like something out of a picture book. And this kind of landscape always has a history. And many good artists come from this landscape. And then the cows in this landscape. In Emmental, there are cows that look at passers-by sweetly, with big, pure cow eyes--and gaze after them. Long...  In Emmental, each hill has a north side and a warm, beautiful south side.  The filmmaker and sheep farmer, Guido Haas, live on the north side of a hill in Emmental, which is called Cold Ground and his house lies low in the valley and is a real Emmental house, with a raised driveway to the barn and a big shingle roof on top. Spiteful, rich neighbors must have gotten the idea of calling it Foxhole.","popularity":0.0496,"poster_path":"/vflpq5ZOPxxjoU8dg1bnuOGwxp2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1979-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Down Below in the Foxhole under the Cold Ground in Emmental","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2393841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guido Haas","original_name":"Guido Haas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e70e669f9aa470013cefd51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gorgon Haas","original_name":"Gorgon Haas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e70e678cedac400154f769c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raban Haas","original_name":"Raban Haas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e70e682cabfe40018177d3d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e70e693cedac400134f3c1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e70e69d2f3b170019485f9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e70e6a4cedac400175014f0","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e70e6b0cedac40017501524","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e70e6b72f3b1700144791a5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2005918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HHK Schoenherr","original_name":"HHK Schoenherr","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jQinN8fmu5VyK5qaqh5Bbe3HC0K.jpg","credit_id":"5e70e6bfcabfe4001517e3e6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vflpq5ZOPxxjoU8dg1bnuOGwxp2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Cinémathèque Française, Centre Pompidou, Beaubourg, paris","release_date":"1979-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
