Beethoven thought she was a bad influence on the boy. Sadly, the nephew isn't receptive to Beethoven's \"overtures\", and resents his boorish uncle's efforts on his behalf. The nephew is a complete nonentity, lacking in both interest and talent. He seems to wish only to be left alone.","popularity":0.3753,"poster_path":"/D7fEBBQKw55ANU0rwQOklacPel.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":163627,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBL
