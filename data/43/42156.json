Wim Wenders is working on his own film Hammett (1983) in Hollywood, but flies to New York to help Ray realize his final wish. Ray's original intent is to make a fiction film about a dying painter who sails to China to find a cure for his disease. He and Wenders discuss this idea, but it is obviously unrealistic given Ray's state of health.","popularity":1.087,"poster_path":"/7xMqesS7iyCE1TAUS41Hl2vXRE8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basis-Film-Verleih
