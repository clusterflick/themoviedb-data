She frequently corresponds with a pen-pal named Night, a boy about the same age as her that she's never actually seen in person. Although Minato and Night are very different - Minato is upbeat while Night is brooding, they get along anyway and she regularly updates him on the happenings in her daily life. Minato is even willing to confide in Night that she's falling in love with a boy she's recently met named Sho.","popularity":0.6549,"poster_path":"/sOPRcDJhNCGvIuSshyjFzOSPkJf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Boy","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"동경 소년","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maki Horikita","original_name":"堀北真希","popularity":0.7107,"profile_path":"/lqzxzOqQgg4sjpY4aTetfr06sz6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Minato Fujiki","credit_id":"52fe461cc3a36847f80ed5bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takuya Ishida","original_name":"石田卓也","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/aHQk6XxqyJinfvrVRADEIg31nOk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shu Karasawa","credit_id":"52fe461cc3a36847f80ed5c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuru Hirata","original_name":"平田満","popularity":0.4985,"profile_path":"/nIWerC0q1ztA0hzG90VdQT32BpP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5df6730465686e0018851e38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1052343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reiko Kusamura","original_name":"草村礼子","popularity":0.3374,"profile_path":"/nwMnEl2EBIESdxatT1nP4NRR33H.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5df67309d1a893001279a69d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":138572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mutsuki Watanabe","original_name":"渡邉睦月","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/yIOMLJ3QrsxpDCjGu71k8hOLRvV.jpg","credit_id":"611dc0c8c14fee005dc5ace5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shunichi Hirano","original_name":"平野俊一","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b05737ec3a36864ab00a0c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1179301","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Rh1p0ndL4fvGCELyf3azdGGPh6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sOPRcDJhNCGvIuSshyjFzOSPkJf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
