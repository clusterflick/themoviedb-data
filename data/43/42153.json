More than eight years later, she was at his side when he died. During this entire time, she only entered his room when he rang for her, sleeping from 9 AM to 3 PM to wait during the night while he wrote. Marcel uses her as more than a servant: she is his muse, telling stories of her childhood to stir his remembrance of things past; she's in cahoots with him as he manipulates those he wants to draw on for his writing; she listens appalled to his descriptions of the underside of Paris. Hers is a life of love and sweet devotion as he races time to finish his work before death.","popularity":0.2762,"poster_path":"/uxaYK9kmDWlAjWT2RURULTrw4Qa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pelemele
