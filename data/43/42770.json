Life is rough in Reykjavik's post-war slum of Camp Thule, where the abandoned US military barracks have been turned into makeshift homes. Struggling wives and their hard-working husbands try to make ends meet. The younger generation dreams of dollars, Rock'n'Roll and the American way of life. To celebrate or to drown their misery - they're never short of a good reason to booze. Devil's Island vividly depicts the everyday life of a wacky family, their neighbours and friends and shows how some of their dreams come true and others don't.","popularity":1.0139,"poster_path":"/7z4ZGmhkfEGH0lphI3f9RoKEcLR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14937,"logo_path":"/yfwZ3LaFHOrek8BWdAnmfpQV3dQ.png","name":"Íslenska kvikmyndasamsteypan","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":76,"logo_path":"/nebkQYtQKhZyHJfh5v0oGpNbPzu.png","name":"Zentropa Entertainments","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Rommel Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":136563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmhuset AS","origin_country":""},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1996-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devil's Island","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Devil's Island","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Djeveløya","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baltasar Kormákur","original_name":"Baltasar Kormákur","popularity":0.2855,"profile_path":"/bpWHj7MUtv0bNRuCET69UWQRa0o.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Baddi","credit_id":"52fe4618c3a36847f80ec72d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigurveig Jónsdóttir","original_name":"Sigurveig Jónsdóttir","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Karolina","credit_id":"606743461e9225002b5e7d1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gísli Halldórsson","original_name":"Gísli Halldórsson","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"52fe4618c3a36847f80ec729","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir","original_name":"Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/jql991uFCSrH8vldewDHojv30q7.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Dolly","credit_id":"6067437debb99d00598b9c09","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sveinn Þórir Geirsson","original_name":"Sveinn Þórir Geirsson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Danni","credit_id":"606743880d2f5300409d7d9c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996538,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saga Jónsdóttir","original_name":"Saga Jónsdóttir","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Gógó","credit_id":"60892bbbe19de9006ebfa742","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingvar E.
