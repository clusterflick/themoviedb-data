It features the work of some of the world’s greatest artists and sculptors, who across two millennia, have depicted the Buddha’s life in art rich in beauty and complexity. Hear insights into the ancient narrative by contemporary Buddhists, including Pulitzer Prize winning poet W.S. Merwin and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Join the conversation and learn more about meditation, the history of Buddhism, and how to incorporate the Buddha’s teachings on compassion and mindfulness into daily life.","popularity":1.1531,"poster_path":"/1nMwkLdJNvHKlqxl4iUN31yCSYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27649,"logo_path":"/xqVQVDFxOuvgEhonUoYqJuNVRNA.png","name":"David Grubin Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of Buddha","title":"The Buddha","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Buddha","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Buddha - La vera storia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gere","original_name":"Richard Gere","popularity":6.6943,"profile_path":"/dVlutWZ75StO0KWGj26sLXe0bjH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe45fac3a36847f80e556d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Brown","original_name":"Blair Brown","popularity":1.1114,"profile_path":"/hnVybZLBUJNr93gCTwgRQRCkjpm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe45fac3a36847f80e5571","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenzin Gyatso","original_name":"Tenzin Gyatso","popularity":0.162,"profile_path":"/dAtWYY56kQURZFKmdgrCTkakXTw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c666d6c3a368626c001eb8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Epstein","original_name":"Mark Epstein","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Psychiatrist / Author","credit_id":"53c666efc3a3686266001f47","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Stanley Merwin","original_name":"William Stanley Merwin","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Poet","credit_id":"53c66705c3a368626c001ebb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Grubin","original_name":"David Grubin","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45fac3a36847f80e557d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Grubin","original_name":"David Grubin","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45fac3a36847f80e5577","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2753562,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michaela von Schweinitz","original_name":"Michaela von Schweinitz","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea86f21feac1011b2df3e0","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2753562,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michaela von Schweinitz","original_name":"Michaela von Schweinitz","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea86fdc613ce014dfc9f31","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1478841","wikidata_id":"Q7720490","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1RoXnKKYGAeTlh1tuASvWwDtyvc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1nMwkLdJNvHKlqxl4iUN31yCSYO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188,"name":"buddhism"},{"id":5722,"name":"buddha"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Buddha Documentary Trailer","key":"RpOAnGcwqlc","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-08-12T07:54:34.000Z","id":"64ea877845819900e3532425"}]}}}
