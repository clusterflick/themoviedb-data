The movie is of the old-school nomadic, skate-everything-in-your-path genre with interludes of stopping to rip-up a big ramp, pool or kicker. After much searching and skateboarding, they locate a large ramp in the desert. They also find a Chinese character on the inside of the ramp's spine. They conclude that in searching for Mr. Chin, they may have found his spirit.","popularity":0.3577,"poster_path":"/vK2fr7P6HwdR0EyiiXzoQs6W58X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Have you seen him?","title":"Powell Peralta: The Search for Animal Chin","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Caballero","original_name":"Steve Caballero","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/jf4HGZpQmXPO0vIorUMI9hw9d2C.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe461ec3a36847f80edaf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":401443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skip Engblom","original_name":"Skip Engblom","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self -
