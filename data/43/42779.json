Cam dreams of building a sanctuary for the geese that fly over the area each year, and he tries several schemes to buy a nearby lake for this santuary. He is thwarted at every attempt, it seems; he and his son try to get enough furs from their trapping venture to get the money, but the bottom falls out of the fur market. He uses the little money they get for a down payment on the lake, thereby losing their house when he can't make the mortgage payment. They move to the lake, where their friends help them build a cabin. A salesman stops in town, and tries to get the people to sell their land for a tourist venture; Cam is outraged at his tactics and takes desperate measures after he himself is tricked.","popularity":2.5685,"poster_path":"/9bXyO4tmktrmqnkntcXw1bJpafP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They dared to dream the impossible!","title":"Those Calloways","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Keith","original_name":"Brian Keith","popularity":1.0004,"profile_path":"/c5Tnce8aeEVigEgctnkNcy4jc2l.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cam Calloway","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec897","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Miles","original_name":"Vera Miles","popularity":1.0845,"profile_path":"/ke0e0i8RkzGfTixKk6nuh6HuQkz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lydia (Liddy) Calloway","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec89b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon De Wilde","original_name":"Brandon De Wilde","popularity":0.5742,"profile_path":"/cl8hufW5kHzDeuzHUgbj2QjdenT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bucky Calloway","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec89f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Brennan","original_name":"Walter Brennan","popularity":0.7364,"profile_path":"/7hlZ3WbT4JQxeN3fLMongUXNHma.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alf Simes","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec8a3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Wynn","original_name":"Ed Wynn","popularity":0.3778,"profile_path":"/ephGLfQWundnRnvMR0JdK2NhJBQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ed Parker","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec8a7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Evans","original_name":"Linda Evans","popularity":0.8422,"profile_path":"/84NeQbNqSFgzBIOiRrW2pGAROgV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bridie Mellott","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec8ab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Abbott","original_name":"Philip Abbott","popularity":0.4913,"profile_path":"/owI8AT0bU0uKPDlRAjp0wvlyFmv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dell Fraser","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec8af","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Larkin","original_name":"John Larkin","popularity":0.2607,"profile_path":"/rSsrUPD7NDYqfSiVyLBwlSquzkP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jim Mellott","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec8b3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parley Baer","original_name":"Parley Baer","popularity":0.4759,"profile_path":"/a6b9pONRmi03ggBpHpevyGokxgJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Doane Shattuck","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec8b7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank De Kova","original_name":"Frank De Kova","popularity":0.5388,"profile_path":"/lVlseygvknUVOgCVOPVDzURKOst.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Nigosh","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a36847f80ec8bb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Roberts","original_name":"Roy Roberts","popularity":0.3969,"profile_path":"/960bdEPTe4A53Skop8J6cfhjuo3.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"E.J.
