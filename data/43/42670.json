But over the last century and a half, it has been the idea of what a missing link is that has evolved. The history of this scientific quest - peopled with fanatics, frauds, amateurs, professionals, the lucky, the unlucky, the unfairly neglected and the undeservedly praised - is the subject of this documentary. Reenactments depict scientists making their discoveries and then stretch back hundreds of thousands, even millions, of years to depict the typical lives of our human and human-like ancestors. Interviews with leading scientists fill in the details.","popularity":0.4969,"poster_path":"/lncLfyIcuB0XnwpDRQADyaUuWpb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harrington Talents","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ape to Man","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Herrmann","original_name":"Edward Herrmann","popularity":1.0067,"profile_path":"/sO9IoAlw3CLJZT6UF35cZBcTYRV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4610c3a36847f80ea8d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Aiello","original_name":"Leslie Aiello","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself - Head of Graduate Schoo","credit_id":"589e9c57925141171e0063d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692601,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joe Caine","original_name":"Joe Caine","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Science & Technology Studies","credit_id":"589e9c6d92514117180066b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Hudson","original_name":"Kevin Hudson","popularity":0.1321,"profile_path":"/1OrwAIDUYbwZXOWbF5FZtgGMsCI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Human","credit_id":"589e9c7c925141172d0065b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tessa Jubber","original_name":"Tessa Jubber","popularity":0.0874,"profile_path":"/242z5k2QUkkwyrNYXjKvK8q4eFM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dora Dart","credit_id":"589e9c8992514117180066cb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Rogers","original_name":"Chris Rogers","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sv√§nte Paabo","credit_id":"589e9ca4925141172a0061ed","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1755432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thorsten Wedekind","original_name":"Thorsten Wedekind","popularity":0.1534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Johann Fuehrott","credit_id":"589e9cb2c3a3684bbf005f04","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nic Young","original_name":"Nic Young","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4610c3a36847f80ea8d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1221123","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lncLfyIcuB0XnwpDRQADyaUuWpb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
