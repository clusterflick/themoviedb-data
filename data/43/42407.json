Played with devilish charm by George C. Scott, Jones takes on a new protégé in Curley, a wide-eyed Army deserter eager for direction. Together, they crisscross the backroads of the rural South, pulling off a string of homespun cons while staying one step ahead of a relentless local sheriff. Along the way, Curley falls for Bonnie Lee Packard, a rebellious heiress who joins their misadventures. But as the scams grow riskier, Curley begins to wonder whether a life of flimflam is worth the price.  With its colorful characters, offbeat humor, and standout performance by Scott, The Flim-Flam Man is a rollicking Southern caper about cons, conscience, and unlikely camaraderie.","popularity":2.5138,"poster_path":"/zNKLe9v0ioYM6foZ3hGFaPTcQYo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-08-22","revenue":1200000,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meet Mordecai Jones; Master of Back-Stabbing, Cork-Screwing and Double-Dealing!","title":"The Flim-Flam Man","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George C.
