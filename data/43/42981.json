Frank and Ollie, the talent behind BAMBI, PINOCCHIO, LADY AND THE TRAMP, THE JUNGLE BOOK, and others, set the standard for such modern-day hits as THE LION KING. It was their creative genius that helped make Disney synonymous with brilliant animation, magnificent music, and emotional storytelling. Take a journey with these extraordinary artists as they share secrets, insights, and the inspiration behind some of the greatest animated movies the world has ever known!","popularity":0.6524,"poster_path":"/eUIELE2IkuWkAc3JzjYz6J2Lpx5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theodore Thomas
