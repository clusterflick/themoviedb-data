For over forty years, he has helped thousands of people physically and emotionally recover from life-threatening diseases and physical traumas. In the small town of Abadiania, Brazil, he has been performing miraculous surgeries without having received any formal training beyond the fourth grade. His patients describe little pain or bleeding, despite the fact that he works with simple instruments and no anesthesia.  As a trance healer, he has no recollection of either the physical or invisible surgeries he performs. His methods defy conventional medicine, yet the results challenge our traditional beliefs. His work of healing the sick began as a young man, and he feels blessed to have found his true purpose in life: To be in the service of God and humanity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miracle Man: John of God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5676182","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
