From Sweden’s coastal landscapes and at a distance from her home in Spain, the filmmaker reflects on her grandmother’s love story to approach a highly political period of Spanish history, one that remains unresolved and that many prefer to forget. Past and present intersect as the lover’s descriptions of southern France in the letters resonate within the Swedish landscape, weaving together memory, exile, and place.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zSQqDJxdA285JSM03zYBtgF9RCR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2024-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solamente puedo esperar","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"All I can do is wait.","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laia Ricart","original_name":"Laia Ricart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e4693368df447890d743","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laia Ricart","original_name":"Laia Ricart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e4758d99f86732dc4a54","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laia Ricart","original_name":"Laia Ricart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e47e02613d279cdb21cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laia Ricart","original_name":"Laia Ricart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e48ab88a80c224dc4a3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5262976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Abbati","original_name":"Diego Abbati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e4a98d99f86732dc4a64","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laia Ricart","original_name":"Laia Ricart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e4ba5cefb0fa14db2240","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934197,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Victor Merino Montes","original_name":"Victor Merino Montes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e4d35a4b70106493496e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934197,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Victor Merino Montes","original_name":"Victor Merino Montes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964e4e5b052df80cab3527a","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":"ES","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/zSQqDJxdA285JSM03zYBtgF9RCR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
