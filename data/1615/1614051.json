In the 1970s, Brendan Hughes from County Tyrone planned jail breaks and bank robberies for the IRA. But when he stole for his own benefit, he found himself being hunted by the police, army and gunmen from the IRA.  After spending long spells in prison, he began to question the use of violence. He now calls for a forum to hear the truth about the Northern Ireland Troubles, in which more than 3,500 people were killed.
