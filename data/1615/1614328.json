They are said to be small (1.5 meters tall), with long ears, and their bodies are completely painted. During the day they hide in caves high in the mountains and only come out at night to hunt.  This is a myth that has become reality. When we speak of a past marked by wars and cultural disappearances, this is precisely what is happening today. Though elusive, the Rabbit Indian is one of the last remaining links in the Naso culture.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4wTieOEx7SkawPnyNq2J5AhJs6C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Milagros Producciones","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PA","name":"Panama"}],"release_date":"2025-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When a myth becomes real and reality becomes a myth","title":"En busca del Indio Conejo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María Neyla Santamaría","original_name":"María Neyla Santamaría","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69643e528613e14953dc47f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie Canavaggio","original_name":"Annie Canavaggio","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69643e665f1f49ed877b1801","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie Canavaggio","original_name":"Annie Canavaggio","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69643e7b90ad508b37dc46e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie Canavaggio","original_name":"Annie Canavaggio","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69643e89763c9c7e5db34d77","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María Neyla Santamaría","original_name":"María Neyla Santamaría","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69643e962f5b19da659345ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María Neyla Santamaría","original_name":"María Neyla Santamaría","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69643ea4769b3ff8ddd8c4a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349430,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carlos Arango De Montis","original_name":"Carlos Arango De Montis","popularity":0.4552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69643ec567bcaafc4e934620","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":726,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oNLv6QB30xJjepkfORmiQf0vEoh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1291}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1417,"iso_3166_1":"ES","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4wTieOEx7SkawPnyNq2J5AhJs6C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":992}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"En busca del indio conejo | Tráiler","key":"lNo7FNGi0qA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-12-04T16:17:52.000Z","id":"69644156c0ff623ee7b34d5d"}]}}}
