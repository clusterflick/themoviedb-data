The protest joined the transnational Baodiao movement, launched by overseas Chinese students in America and taken up across Taiwan and Hong Kong in defense of Chinese territorial claims.  The film was produced by 70s Biweekly, a radical publication that served as a crucial platform for political debate among young Hong Kong intellectuals. Co-founders Ng Chung-yin and Mok Chiu-yu, who organized the demonstrations themselves, commissioned directors Law Kar and Chiu Tak-hak to create a documentary from inside the movement. The camera moves with the protesters, capturing chants, gestures, and surging crowds as they unfold. This approach transforms cinema into a tool of activism—the filmmakers weren't documenting history but participating in it, positioning the camera as part of collective action rather than a neutral observer.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hong Kong's 1971 Diaoyutai Movement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Law Kar","original_name":"Law Kar","popularity":0.839,"profile_path":"/gU8EwIVpK3OIYVKuPIk4WZUiJMk.jpg","credit_id":"6963d72a6aaa6dbdecb5586a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
