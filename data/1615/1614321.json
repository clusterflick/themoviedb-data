Fidan lives in two time periods - the past and the present. In modern times, when entrepreneurship is developing, Fidan, a businessman who has lost his way and thinks that arbitrariness and the possibility of solving everything with money, falls in love with him, so he wants to privatize the \"Maid's Tower\" and somehow buys the tower. However, just as Fidan protected the tower from foreign usurpers in the past, he also fights against the businessman in the present. In the film, the girl's lover Sabir is also a militant young man who participates in the process of demanding rights at rallies and pickets.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":285918,"logo_path":null,"name":"\"Step\" Ltd Kinoşirkəti","origin_country":"AZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Maiden Tower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5932898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Halimat Mammadova","original_name":"Həlimət Məmmədova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vtwibMmJDi9PUVI4TWUCm1HZhD3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c39961eae87bab34e79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2081049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vagif Azeryar","original_name":"Vaqif Azəryar","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/i32hiPnL6y2TtZpoAkAhxQ6yRzp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c3d5cefb0fa14db1eb0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabir Mammadov","original_name":"Sabir Məmmədov","popularity":0.1648,"profile_path":"/3FQrY8Qsq1rZfNcvc6vHBoZmjah.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c448abb743e8990d51a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5481974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Təranə Əliyeva","original_name":"Təranə Əliyeva","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c59aac10f2b6d28441d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5393670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Məhərrəm Qurbanov","original_name":"Məhərrəm Qurbanov","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/e7ROnnGDTsVPGgdzRqIsNScqpog.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c64961eae87bab34e7c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2054518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nahida Orujova","original_name":"Nahidə Orucova","popularity":0.1713,"profile_path":"/mrqL0XZPtm6KzEZ0BDnGRisbjFm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c6a3563ac54da7b170d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2048031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asgar Rahimov","original_name":"Əsgər Rəhimov","popularity":0.3448,"profile_path":"/uGxRTZWeacfDQml1JzjFe2vtpD4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c7c63a2e70e427b16d1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1811686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zarnigar Aghakishiyeva","original_name":"Zərnigar Ağakişiyeva","popularity":0.4096,"profile_path":"/4OdcewJKxcp5fSgHWjF6jHu6f7g.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c8250cde2cd64dc4763","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2078100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fidan Akhundova","original_name":"Fidan Axundova","popularity":0.1713,"profile_path":"/nvOqVYlMpNPyuUS923Gze9K16OB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"69643c9d63712db1d490d2ef","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2083384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nofel Shahlaroglu","original_name":"Nofəl Şahlaroğlu","popularity":0.3246,"profile_path":"/ahTgPCn9ICDbtAzltqd09w82Ds2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"69643cab69c576f47ddc46c0","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4466289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruhengiz Allahverdiyeva","original_name":"Ruhəngiz Allahverdiyeva","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"69643cb08c5e6f9561284452","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2081049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vagif Azeryar","original_name":"Vaqif Azəryar","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/i32hiPnL6y2TtZpoAkAhxQ6yRzp.jpg","credit_id":"69643c267d3a3edb99b34d18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4480,"name":"businessman"},{"id":3754,"name":"legend"},{"id":4379,"name":"time travel"},{"id":6162,"name":"past"},{"id":260112,"name":"present"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
