Each issue is debated using well-known Malian social advocates. In Mali, ‘madmen’ are seen as those who speak truths uncompromisingly, and are prepared to say what others are too scared to say. In addition, they naturally elicit a sympathetic and tolerant response from others in Malian society, so their words may be better absorbed by the general public. In the film, the clothing they wear symbolises environmental pollution caused by plastic, a serious global issue.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fatow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
