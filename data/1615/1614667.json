(2024), Gio Petti's new documentary The Train to Nowhere shifts focus from buses to rail, centring on the Line 2 expansion of Ottawa’s Light Rail Transit (LRT), a project that many commuters hoped would mark a turning point for transit in the city. The documentary follows Petti as he documents the circumstances surrounding the expansion, the project's transition to a hot-button political issue, and the broader impact on riders who depend on the various systems every day. It also explores themes of retaining optimism and taking charge for change in the transit system in the face of cynicism.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vwun7vGrIIkJXpyJfwhL9rcyGAt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE TRAIN TO NOWHERE -
