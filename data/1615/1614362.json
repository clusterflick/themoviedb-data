From the struggles of being led by an alpha male, to fighting the lusty desires of old flames, this mother decides to explore what happiness means to her, without permission or transparency. They say the grass isn’t greener on the other side, but what if you have more than one lawn?  HOE is structured around an upper middle-class family’s life in southern California. A stay-at-home mom with no financial worries realizes she isn’t as happy as she portrays on social media and to her family and friends. Thirsty for fulfillment romantically and in a career, Ciara begins using her free time to test the pros and cons of attaining what she wants. Using music as the narrator, HOE will have you second-guessing the double standards society has placed on women and their role in their household.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"H.O.E
