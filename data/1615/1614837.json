Cuba – Coocuyo Remix is a neorealist comedy that observes their everyday life without filters, moving between clichés and moments of truth, and transforming daily existence into a collective portrait. The film follows both the pioneers and the new generation of Cuba’s electronic music scene, showing how their dedication continues to shape the island’s nightlife culture, in a story where music gives way to the full force of reality.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/hh3uHLwEBcbgatDvhnzN5u3kGsC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198303,"logo_path":"/bJ9ZkJ0tQ5Qmg2B7iTxWI36eO5v.png","name":"ElectroWish Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CUBA - COOCUYO REMIX","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.151,"profile_path":"/83uRlpeeez7fkA3RwTAzIeE9v09.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Screenstory","credit_id":"6965750c9d2ab32de3d4f636","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.151,"profile_path":"/83uRlpeeez7fkA3RwTAzIeE9v09.jpg","credit_id":"69657296409cb929e87b1d19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hh3uHLwEBcbgatDvhnzN5u3kGsC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":184345,"name":"neorealism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
