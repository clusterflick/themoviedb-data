A reckoning with rebellion, violence, and fear - facing a world to which he no longer belongs, yet which continues to shape him. The film Children of Peace explores the complex legacy of a vanishing minority: the Anabaptists. A radical Reformation-era faith community committed to the principle of nonviolence. But centuries of bloody persecution have repeatedly put their ideals to the test, eventually pushing them to take up arms themselves. Growing up in a German-speaking family in a remote village in the French-speaking Jura, Jürgen learned at a young age that standing up for one's beliefs often comes at a price. The story of the Gerber family is the story of the Anabaptists. It is the story of a long struggle between resistance and submission, between idealism and compromise, driven by the question: How do we find peace?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eFOjWvglAlaAw1yrLDmj9y25L3B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":252202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schwarzfalter GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2025-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"documentary","title":"Children of Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Enfants de la Paix","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürgen Gerber","original_name":"Jürgen Gerber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6963c8cc49a611cc843d70eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Gerber","original_name":"Karin Gerber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"herself","credit_id":"6963c8e3772a118c201721cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Ulrich Gerber","original_name":"Hans Ulrich Gerber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6963c90320171fecf53d6856","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelly Gerber-Geiser","original_name":"Nelly Gerber-Geiser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"herself","credit_id":"6963c91f5e285ee5ad17217b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5931895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Duerr","original_name":"Andreas Duerr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963c7e36f1f895864f41156","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932458,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andreas Duerr","original_name":"Andreas Duerr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963c8110cb2479034171f59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3687699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan-Marc Furer","original_name":"Jan-Marc Furer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963c8580a947848aff41295","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37428935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Gh8zV1LSnUX9gqOkXlpWVI9tQ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFOjWvglAlaAw1yrLDmj9y25L3B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kinder des Friedens | Trailer","key":"1068053236","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-11T09:25:50.000Z","id":"6963cc4deb83cb1025d1564f"}]}}}
