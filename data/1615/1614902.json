More than sixty years later, the filmmaker pairs these fragile images with a personal narration that asks what survives of us when memory fades, and whether wonder can keep us alive in the stories we leave behind. Intimate in scope yet universal in resonance, marigold is not nostalgia but rescue, a cinematic elegy about holding on before it is too late.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/j0JU9zh7QexxmoMoOVviL2KEI9F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"someone has to remember","title":"marigold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5313428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dusty Dale Barker","original_name":"Dusty Dale Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5eApNvM4jsP3TwA0C2Rve0KC4ho.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6965a4f1b1b84a14fd2edad2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5313428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dusty Dale Barker","original_name":"Dusty Dale Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5eApNvM4jsP3TwA0C2Rve0KC4ho.jpg","credit_id":"6965a500b1b84a14fd2edada","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5313428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dusty Dale Barker","original_name":"Dusty Dale Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5eApNvM4jsP3TwA0C2Rve0KC4ho.jpg","credit_id":"6965a509f274ae7a82b9b4d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38049121","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1280,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j0JU9zh7QexxmoMoOVviL2KEI9F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":864}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
