The film follows the lives of elephant bulls towering tuskers whose presence embodies resilience, wisdom, and the legacy of an ancient lineage. Set against the dramatic backdrop of Mount Kilimanjaro and the open plains of Amboseli, Tusker offers a rare glimpse into the complex lives of these giants, from solitary journeys to the subtle social bonds that form between males.
