He knows all about what is going on in his city of Maribor. But above all, he is a first-class percussionist. He has appeared on stage with some of the greatest Slovenian and international musicians, playing rock, world music, and jazz. At the pinnacle of creativity, Mario learns he has terminal cancer.
