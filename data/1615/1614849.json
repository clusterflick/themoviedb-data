So this was a chance to record the everyday life that we and others don’t see, of what its like to be queer and live in Hackney, how we exist and support each other, the challenges and ways the community comes together, to cover working, creativity, expression, housing, mobility, ageing, support, love, all in one day as a snap shot of life, to show its diversity, and not just the more visible members, but the everyday people and a glimpse into their daily routine.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/phoxjB1mXm2bQxTMFSVmsxF1Y0t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"One Queer Day In Hackney","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849462,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrew Woodyatt","original_name":"Andrew Woodyatt","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69657ae0f7e8c42809d8cba3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/phoxjB1mXm2bQxTMFSVmsxF1Y0t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":814}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://riocinema.org.uk/Rio.dll/WhatsOn?f=2066095","release_date":"2026-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
