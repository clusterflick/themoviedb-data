Despite their differences, the two engage in a spirited discussion about life, responsibilities, and regrets. Beatrice, weighed down by adult responsibilities, questions Olivia's eagerness to grow up, while Olivia, frustrated with her teenage struggles and longing for more control over her life, believes that adulthood will offer her the escape she desires. Their conversation reveals Beatrice's unhappiness with her career and Olivia's strained relationship with her family, each reflecting what the other resents or longs for. As their trains come in, Beatrice steps off with a renewed determination to alter her future, while Olivia remains the same, holding tightly to the assurance of her initial direction.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Station","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5148266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mo Paquette","original_name":"Mo Paquette","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Beatrice","credit_id":"6963dc258b3aa3d99d5967a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernanda Kinzel","original_name":"Fernanda Kinzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"6963dc33991409c5313d73e6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5699774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arian Nazemrazavi","original_name":"Arian Nazemrazavi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963dbb829df01c724bd4190","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5699774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arian Nazemrazavi","original_name":"Arian Nazemrazavi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963dbc4089275bf50b55755","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932626,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rie Uchida","original_name":"Rie Uchida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963dbd833b7c612f81d9280","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5699770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Gothreau","original_name":"Justin Gothreau","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963dbe477676bf5d5365648","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5699770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Gothreau","original_name":"Justin Gothreau","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963dbed5e285ee5ad172213","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932627,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sue Santos","original_name":"Sue Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963dbfd6980926cf91d922e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932629,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aidan Burke","original_name":"Aidan Burke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963dc102664de36691d9189","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36575320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
