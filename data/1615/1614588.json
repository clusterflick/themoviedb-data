Her dentures become a darkly comic metaphor for everything she can't control: desire, loss, and mortality. Both tender and unsettling, the film is a chamber piece about defiance in decline, a woman refusing to go quietly, holding on to her bite until the very end.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joan's Teeth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Turner","original_name":"Kathleen Turner","popularity":2.5412,"profile_path":"/hvmMGjWKy1CGmaJzPtOtbb3fD57.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joan","credit_id":"69650019e67dcce31adc4c4f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Padraic Lillis","original_name":"Padraic Lillis","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6965002eee0baeb778284931","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5934378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dipti Bramhandkar","original_name":"Dipti Bramhandkar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6965004edf0d4a115b7b1c67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831681,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Liza Gipsova","original_name":"Liza Gipsova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69650074aac10f2b6d284893","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Rios Lin","original_name":"Kim Rios Lin","popularity":0.3429,"profile_path":"/vjEHonL9ia3lLgnXfrZ2yIsyB1J.jpg","credit_id":"696500923af6831885d4f284","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coley Campany","original_name":"Coley Campany","popularity":0.5884,"profile_path":"/vg7YQrnWAx3nINkzpbKSVimWXXg.jpg","credit_id":"696500a8a469d5d99c284852","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3946918,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paloma Ruvira","original_name":"Paloma Ruvira","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696500fb3f9220523990d768","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38571417","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
