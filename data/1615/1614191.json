This first systematic genocide of the 20th century was committed by the Young Turks (Ottoman Empire) and would not have been possible without the support of some Kurdish local rulers and their family clans. The Assyrians are the indigenous people of Mesopotamia and have lived in Mesopotamia for thousands of years. The film includes testimony from several European, Turkish and Assyrian historians, as well as genocide researchers, including Professor Taner Akcam, Dr. Gabriele Yonan and Professor David Gaunt. The film includes testimony from survivors of the genocide.  Various journalists and publicists also have their say with well-researched information in this documentary. The Assyrians refer to the Genocide as \"Seyfo\" (ܣܝܦܐ), which translates as \"sword\".","popularity":0.1357,"poster_path":"/bTfD3OCL4o9Aib7T6chd7EERgCd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":285893,"logo_path":null,"name":"Assyrian Federation of Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":285902,"logo_path":null,"name":"Assyrian Union Berlin eV (Berlin)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seyfo 1915 -
