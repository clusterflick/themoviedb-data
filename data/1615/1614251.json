Once owned by prominent American family, the Carnegies, much of the island came under the National Park Service in 1972, while some heirs retained lifetime rights to remain. Today, more than 60,000 people visit the island each year. Tourism sustains the nearby town of St. Mary’s, and the island’s feral horses have become a defining symbol of its history and appeal. But the presence of more than 140 non-native horses within a fragile ecosystem has sparked an ongoing debate about ecological balance, animal welfare, and preservation. In 2023, a federal court acknowledged the horses’ suffering and environmental impact, but declined to require intervention. The Horses of Cumberland Island is an observational documentary examining the tension between history, tourism, and ecology in a place where what we cherish and what the land can sustain are not always aligned.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/arWvb0rABrZqCfSPFyU7hRsc9Iz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Horses of Cumberland Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125655,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jess Lowe Chaverri","original_name":"Jess Lowe Chaverri","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69640f1ca469d5d99c284306","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125655,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jess Lowe Chaverri","original_name":"Jess Lowe Chaverri","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69640f23076e3bab407b1658","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":813,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/arWvb0rABrZqCfSPFyU7hRsc9Iz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
