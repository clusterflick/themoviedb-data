Alice travels through a wormhole, and is transported into an alternate version of the recent past where she encounters different versions of herself and her friend and lab partner, Bob. Trapped in a world that has diverged from ours during the Cold War, and which prizes collectivism over individuality, Alice is forced to confront her life choices, grappling with profound questions about identity, fate, and the search for meaning. Shot on anamorphic lenses with a wide range of creative in-camera effects, and in collaboration with experts in the field, The Alice Paradox is a philosophical sci fi grounded in real world physics, which touches on the cosmic and spiritual feelings inspired in scientists when studying nature at the grandest scale. It offers a new perspective on the genre of sci-fi.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alice Paradox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4626615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Kinsey","original_name":"Jessica Kinsey","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alicia Narcissi","credit_id":"6964d64c3af6831885d4f16e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwithian Evans","original_name":"Gwithian Evans","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Robert Echo","credit_id":"6964d663325a8ea32bdc49a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeline Smith","original_name":"Madeline Smith","popularity":0.9307,"profile_path":"/xivbxX80KtHYWRKVjNu7FtgDzmZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Angela Hobbes","credit_id":"6964d678c893dab95edb21bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffery Kissoon","original_name":"Jeffery Kissoon","popularity":0.4707,"profile_path":"/8jlJSjdk9uNMXkS0hlIGinT3jzy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dean Gorgias","credit_id":"6964d695e9b4a7a5e4db226b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Zimmerman","original_name":"Phil Zimmerman","popularity":0.3294,"profile_path":"/9kYoNUQ1Gb9cZ8JfN2IsiW9KHH8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cranny","credit_id":"6964d6a2372d20bba2d8c780","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4626614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Brooke","original_name":"William Brooke","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964d621951d66765bd4efe9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4626614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Brooke","original_name":"William Brooke","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6964d63363712db1d490d505","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
