The story moves so fast that a typical cinemagoer may find it difficult to follow it to understand the core message it delivers. But that is typical of all Handagama creations. Unless you dive into them several times, with patience in mind and heart, you cannot learn of what he says. But once it dawns on you, you will find them rare gems that have been carefully cut and polished for you to enjoy the hidden beauty in them. Till then, Handagama himself is magic, mystery, and wonder.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gVb5B2VtUSRaHzPWjByw4u9rEmc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","name":"Sri Lanka"}],"release_date":"1996-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sinhalese","iso_639_1":"si","name":"සිංහල"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanda Dadayama / Moon Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":801468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaushalaya Fernando","original_name":"Kaushalaya Fernando","popularity":0.3862,"profile_path":"/fhT26HjNGsGHy34nwGlhJg8qmgS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69651039ee983b62e1d4f244","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahendra Perera","original_name":"Mahendra Perera","popularity":0.4795,"profile_path":"/5dTGjqorQHlXH0yYZMzYTrOyx9t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6965105b3af6831885d4f2c9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asoka Handagama","original_name":"Asoka Handagama","popularity":0.3159,"profile_path":"/4Qmuh9GuVr9PlpGwrnmqnEzY4nx.jpg","credit_id":"6965107517c4d9100a7b19c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1019958","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gVb5B2VtUSRaHzPWjByw4u9rEmc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"si","note":"","release_date":"1996-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
