Surrounded by silence and routine, her focus is subtly disrupted by a news broadcast playing nearby. What first feels like background noise begins to resonate more deeply, awakening emotions she has long kept buried.  As the outside world intrudes, the confined space becomes increasingly oppressive. Through tight framing, shifting colour tones, and an immersive soundscape, the film traces Louise’s inner unraveling as suppressed trauma surfaces. Reality and memory blur, and the act of studying turns into a struggle for control.  A restrained psychological drama, Quod Corpus Tenet explores the weight the body carries when silence becomes unbearable, inviting the audience into an intimate and unsettling experience of repression, vulnerability, and emotional collapse.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2026-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quod Corpus Tenet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anfisa Tymchenko","original_name":"Anfisa Tymchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Louise","credit_id":"6963ed60ee983b62e1d4ebdf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5734969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lavinia Ineza","original_name":"Lavinia Ineza","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Clinton Solan (voice)","credit_id":"6963eda0325a8ea32bdc4521","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliyo Baron-Imaizumi","original_name":"Eliyo Baron-Imaizumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"News reporter (voice)","credit_id":"6963eddae5c2a04fb5d8c279","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anaya Cash-Abbey","original_name":"Anaya Cash-Abbey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Secretary (voice)","credit_id":"6963ee19a709ef9b9fb34ba7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5734992,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luis Swan","original_name":"Luis Swan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963ee35e9b4a7a5e4db1d04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5734971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Bellare-Creswell","original_name":"Kai Bellare-Creswell","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963ee54578d434f6993436a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932741,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lina Amsellem","original_name":"Lina Amsellem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963ee755374061fc9b34b93","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
