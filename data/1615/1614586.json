The reason for their separation is that Aytekin is the daughter of a king, and Tuncay is a simple engraver. Another issue is that Tuncay takes a shaman as his apprentice. As a result of a miracle, Tuncay arrives a thousand years later - in modern Baku and manages to find both the girl he loves and her father. But what has changed in Baku during these thousand years? Will our hero be able to reunite with the woman he loves in conditions that are completely alien to him, in the vortex of time?","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/8HXdukBrDVlbZYCp6a4l4v7j795.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":259100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kintamani Film","origin_country":"AZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2019-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Love Legend","title":"The Maiden Tower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","title":"Qız Qalası: Bir məhəbbət əfsanəsi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Maiden Tower: A Love Legend","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4461678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamala Piriyeva","original_name":"Kəmalə Piriyeva","popularity":0.459,"profile_path":"/7qF4uLxHYqpU0u0ktQOL3e5462f.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aytekin","credit_id":"6965025b3f9220523990d76f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2385159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ziya Agha","original_name":"Ziya Ağa","popularity":0.2166,"profile_path":"/5gOTibBnzGUDxuMJRQq925bImsz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tuncay","credit_id":"696502561305d7df6adb2234","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5934478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chinara Malikzadeh","original_name":"Çinarə Məlikzadə","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6965090903f9a4b3f82847f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4219763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmaddin Jafarov","original_name":"Elməddin Cəfərov","popularity":0.3627,"profile_path":"/3AmzISvu9kqpnIL2f0vOCIEtHHB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"696502675fa8c3b0a7934a48","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4888578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tural Azizov","original_name":"Tural Əzizov","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/7U6VMHnUzH792BaJiEirYPWBRs2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6965026e3f9220523990d776","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reza Naji","original_name":"رضا ناجی","popularity":0.3659,"profile_path":"/lO7H6c1ArDhS6WYvDPnz9meQtLW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"69650272664739720d934941","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4218634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nijat Rahimov","original_name":"Nicat Rəhimov","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/9B96PP8NuMJ0ulHhRAaCR7Swy4U.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"696509242c652d17b628494b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2042450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilham Gasimov","original_name":"İlham Qasımov","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/vXXjNY7JlXjstetltFu1VBQcT7B.jpg","credit_id":"696500379727813d2fd4f1c2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4898644,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tural Sevdimalı","original_name":"Tural Sevdimalı","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/bWy19HljigxLGMLN476vYROGT58.jpg","credit_id":"6965003fc4a2832ffddb2323","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2042450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilham Gasimov","original_name":"İlham Qasımov","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/vXXjNY7JlXjstetltFu1VBQcT7B.jpg","credit_id":"6965017390ad508b37dc4b19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/33uDH8NBu13nbjErLDgXFQchIBS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"AZ","iso_639_1":"az","file_path":"/8HXdukBrDVlbZYCp6a4l4v7j795.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4379,"name":"time travel"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":204242,"name":"forced marriage"},{"id":290807,"name":"medieval times"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
