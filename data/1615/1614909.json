But for ACMG Splitboard guides Christine Feleki and Joey Vosburgh, it’s their job to make each of their 150+ days a year in the mountains meaningful.  Working as a guide is a non-stop grind of managing uncertainty, prioritizing safety, and finding time in between to hone skills and techniques in a constantly evolving field. It’s also the best job in the world - they’ll tell you that. To strive for longevity as a guide requires a deep knowledge of avalanche safety and risk assessment, but equally important is a constant emphasis on self-reflection and growth. This year, they ventured in a corner of the Selkirk Range that Joey’s been eyeing for years, working their way through variable conditions, reflecting on their journeys, and stepping into uncertainty with an open mind.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stepping Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5863662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Feleki","original_name":"Christine Feleki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6965a68f47001131bc192865","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
