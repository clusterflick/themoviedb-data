I filmed a lot with it, but I never knew what to do with the footage. After assembling all of the video into a timeline and listening to some music, I ended up making this experimental short film. It’s amazing how this camera seems to subtract 20 years from whatever is recorded and throws everything back to the early 2000’s.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xvW8IMJerCFDAipXTJkWZ3DeCey.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Day Japan on a 2000’s Camcorder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Szpot","original_name":"Mike Szpot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696d650819252d2a9a7fa42d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1700,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvW8IMJerCFDAipXTJkWZ3DeCey.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
