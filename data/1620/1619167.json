Captured across one snowstorm this season, along with years prior, the film moves through both day and night, allowing each storm to unfold in its own rhythm. The quiet of winter days. The weight of falling snow after dark. The subtle shift in energy that winter brings to the city.  This film observes the daily life that continues in the cold. People moving through their routines and streets softened by snowfall. Winter can slow the city down, but it never stops it.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/bWJncAe2CQez83NobuFiLSyav8r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snowfall in New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Szpot","original_name":"Mike Szpot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696d63a4742c136ece36ae1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1700,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bWJncAe2CQez83NobuFiLSyav8r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
