There, he meets Tom — a man further along the same path, who recognises his own past in Dylan and quietly offers understanding rather than judgment. As stories are shared and silences linger, the film observes the difficult, often invisible act of choosing to stay.  Plastic Chairs is an intimate short film about relapse, accountability, and the courage it takes to show up for yourself when it feels impossible. Chloe Webb makes her directorial debut.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/vpkf9U9e1pB1jjPIVQE5znJCM2R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post
