Locationista is an off-beat dramedy about Nina, a nomad location scout with \"roots floating flat in the air,\" Vika, a control-freak producer on the verge of a breakdown, and Lina, a fiery French homeowner abandoned after nine years of marriage.  From anti-corporate manifestos and \"shamanic dips\" in green lakes to the harsh reality of indie filmmaking where peanuts and passion are the only currency, this film is a journey through the messy, absurd, and beautiful glory of finding oneself when there is no closure in sight. A visual experiment in embracing chaos, it explores the mathematician's paradox of human emotions—proving that when logic fails, shared vulnerability creates a new path.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/xZq0ocsy9k2MgSy6KRrxmzTdCLL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let the shit turn into luck... during our lifetimes!","title":"Locationista","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3491604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirela Creţan","original_name":"Mirela Creţan","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lina","credit_id":"696d4da16a2c23c74baaab1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2170805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcela Motoc","original_name":"Marcela Motoc","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"696d4e38238a62418d36a39d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5947655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgia Mihalcea","original_name":"Georgia Mihalcea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vo2P13DecBPlxQbq8wiyqZatfJV.jpg","credit_id":"696d4fa744a97153a736b1b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5947655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgia Mihalcea","original_name":"Georgia Mihalcea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vo2P13DecBPlxQbq8wiyqZatfJV.jpg","credit_id":"696d4fd6bb1123e50e20cd88","department":"Writing","job":"Screenstory"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5947655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgia Mihalcea","original_name":"Georgia Mihalcea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vo2P13DecBPlxQbq8wiyqZatfJV.jpg","credit_id":"696d5291f588fb49dff94b79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13731304","wikidata_id":"Q137808972","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5mr3URckGD5KVfbvTpNY5UGdO4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xZq0ocsy9k2MgSy6KRrxmzTdCLL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1599,"name":"midlife crisis"},{"id":5248,"name":"female friendship"},{"id":203322,"name":"dramedy"},{"id":312677,"name":"existential crisis"},{"id":351726,"name":"drama comedy"},{"id":353045,"name":"off-beat"},{"id":357701,"name":"dark humor"},{"id":358650,"name":"quirky characters"},{"id":360713,"name":"indie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Locationista | Trailer","key":"KqL1Li_LnPg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-13T17:37:55.000Z","id":"696d5b08eafe7e3224f1231b"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Locationista | Making-of Scene  - Nina, Wake Up!","key":"3hjXak9y4K4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Bloopers","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-02T06:10:35.000Z","id":"696d5b9f8cd061402068a0bb"}]}}}
