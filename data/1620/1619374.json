One can count the number of Brits who are bold enough to play this game on a pair of frostbitten fingers, and Andy and Ian are both experienced in the art of suffering. Through sunshine and snow, bad times and worse, this film is an honest and revealing insight into the world of modern alpinism and big-wall climbing.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/o9L4mxlzoOsXFPK708lALV3MdAZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Haul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2099612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Kirkpatrick","original_name":"Andy Kirkpatrick","popularity":0.0446,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"696e09847754e97c4f20d719","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1403149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Parnell","original_name":"Ian Parnell","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"696e0995673d90fa8a36b730","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3999723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Christophe Lafaille","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Lafaille","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/p2p3sjfP98w2vIANGzcd1V3v8uj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"696e09a57754e97c4f20d720","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5948817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karen Barber","original_name":"Karen Barber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e09bcac35787a6f7fa624","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o9L4mxlzoOsXFPK708lALV3MdAZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
