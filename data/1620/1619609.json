His music charms its gatekeepers, and the gods allow Eurydice to return—on the condition that Orpheus leads her back to the world of the living without gazing upon her face.  In this new production, Director Joachim Schamberger envisions the famous couple later in life as Eurydice descends into dementia—a heartbroken Orpheus uses love and the power of music to rescue her from darkness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7gqd3GBKUAm0S3KshOiUU32TZI4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orpheus and Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3337950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Cutting","original_name":"Hugh Cutting","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Orpheus","credit_id":"696e959f491fd52f47aab54e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madison Leonard","original_name":"Madison Leonard","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eurydice","credit_id":"696e95b3cdcb0cebbd36b94c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Norelai","original_name":"Amber Norelai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Amore","credit_id":"696e95d5465299eacbf95427","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629624,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emmanuel Villaume","original_name":"Emmanuel Villaume","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e967c695591492c20db6b","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Schamberger","original_name":"Joachim Schamberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e96c1491fd52f47aab565","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949881,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tommy Bourgeois","original_name":"Tommny Bourgeois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e97618b9d779b89f12a0f","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2719116,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Driscoll Otto","original_name":"Driscoll Otto","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e97c7fb4a73c13d8fd79c","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949898,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"david zimmerman","original_name":"david zimmerman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e9881e2747dcd7b20d684","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","original_name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e9a89a170300061f129ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.735,"height":816,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7gqd3GBKUAm0S3KshOiUU32TZI4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
