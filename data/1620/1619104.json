The cats aren’t wild, but they need human help to survive. Problem is, some Romans consider these strays equal to rodents – and view those who feed or care for them with equal contempt.  Cats of Rome documents six months at Torre Argentina, Rome’s largest cat sanctuary. With its many feline inhabitants – and constant threats from overpopulation, overcrowding, disease, and detractors – life at Torre Argentina is a never-ending struggle for the cats and the people who care for them.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fFbDk5QWQVCkDlPY9SdVXs2i6r4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Figleaf Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":113528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathfinder Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THe Roman Empire Is Gone, But 200,000 Cats Remain...","title":"Cats of Rome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5947826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Burberry","original_name":"Keith Burberry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"696d473d1bf05abb8ddcb469","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5947815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael W.
