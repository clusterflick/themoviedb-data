But even though everyone is very lilacly-loving to it and constantly feeds it with sweet lucky clover, the little critter does not behave unicorn-like at all. It just keeps saying no, so soon its family just calls it uNOcorn. One day, the uNOcorn breaks out of its cotton candy world and sets off to NOWHERE. On the way, he unexpectedly meets a raccoon that refuses to listen (HUHcoon), a watchdog that doesn‘t seem to care about anything (SOWHATchdog), and princess that always talks back (PrinceYES). The four of them make a pretty good team. Because even being stubborn is much more fun together.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Soi","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":96,"logo_path":"/9ps82gVzUeNdkjmLzoGDQLiLDio.png","name":"X Filme Creative Pool","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":96105,"logo_path":"/yTIbkYK1VGE64FSFqPj5jGDvLG.png","name":"Warner Bros.
