First, you have to climb the Aiguille du Goûter, at the summit of which, at 3,817 meters, clings the Goûter refuge, a small metal box where you spend the night. The climb is 1,500 meters long, including some of the most technical sections. 2:00 a.m. The alarm rings, and Carole Dechantre and Jean-Paul Lemercier begin their ascent of the Dôme du Goûter by the light of their headlamps. With the first rays of sunlight, the Arête des Bosses is illuminated. Already, the surrounding mountains seem smaller. One last effort, and they finally reach the summit of Mont Blanc, the roof of the Alps, at 4,810 meters.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/NRBgWpV54n9ZwoYYqtWKOjXGWP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61140,"logo_path":"/21g6rubA53jguu5zukO6sxnFenS.png","name":"Vertiges Prod","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1999-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montagnes De Rêve: Le Mont-Blanc","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3697552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Paul Lemercier","original_name":"Jean-Paul Lemercier","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/6ZUaeRUzwanLt1TPVuAOnxAIsgG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (Mountain Guide)","credit_id":"696ef23e9dbd002fa2f2b4b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1497925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Dechantre","original_name":"Carole Dechantre","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/gw6NPWAL3wZBz4Y9St0GM5OfFWn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"696ef24752a6709be7fe0f35","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Devrient","original_name":"Sébastien Devrient","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":"/hgS6TPySjYDAIkFtt2G4A5Bnjno.jpg","credit_id":"696ef1ec99ca370ea8e0a877","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Devrient","original_name":"Sébastien Devrient","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":"/hgS6TPySjYDAIkFtt2G4A5Bnjno.jpg","credit_id":"696ef1f3336f9254e7caeba6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Devrient","original_name":"Sébastien Devrient","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":"/hgS6TPySjYDAIkFtt2G4A5Bnjno.jpg","credit_id":"696ef1fa9dbd002fa2f2b4af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5950411,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frédéric Coupez","original_name":"Frédéric Coupez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696ef20812c8715165caec68","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5950412,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Damien Weber","original_name":"Damien Weber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696ef21899ca370ea8e0a881","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10006748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yaDTpYTq5PnSbFShXnH4Yno61eS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/NRBgWpV54n9ZwoYYqtWKOjXGWP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209282,"name":"french alps"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":239184,"name":"mountain guide"},{"id":309140,"name":"mont blanc"},{"id":349939,"name":"mountaineering documentary film"},{"id":366100,"name":"compagnie des guides de chamonix"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
