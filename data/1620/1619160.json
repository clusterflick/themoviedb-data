When Adrian Brownwell comes to town to publish a newspaper, his cash deposits in Hendricks' bank relieve the banker's worry that an expected bank examiner will discover the shortage in bank funds resulting from Hendricks' support of Barclay. Adrian falls in love with Molly and decides to leave Sycamore Ridge when she refuses to marry him. Barclay threatens Molly with the financial ruin of many whom she holds dear unless she marries Adrian, and Bob returns from the East to find Molly the new Mrs. Brownwell.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":43421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Great Authors Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":105286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selznick Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Certain Rich Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2102343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Gantvoort","original_name":"Carl Gantvoort","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bob Hendricks","credit_id":"696d5e29c480113d6e68a098","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Adams","original_name":"Claire Adams","popularity":0.345,"profile_path":"/2My48FqA4jYmwBjA6gsNbIF9rkV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Molly Culpepper","credit_id":"696d5e3a42add78c23f94b52","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert McKim","original_name":"Robert McKim","popularity":0.4215,"profile_path":"/1dZoA6zzietwEh6trnBIC9QK4Xb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Barclay","credit_id":"696d5e4525afc64fb2dcb55a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.4994,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Adrian Brownwell","credit_id":"696d5e51d76a580fcef12136","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
