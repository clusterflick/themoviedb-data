Vettorazi used creative coding and data moshing, a form of video manipulation that involves intentionally corrupting the compression data of video files, to create the glitch effects that aligned with Stubbert's original composition. The music was created from acoustic recordings of a piano and a harp, processed and re-composed. The becquerel is the unit of radioactivity in the International System of Units (SI). One becquerel is defined as an activity of one decay per second.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3qw1oOEdts8ycNb2XlntMAk5gEA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becquerel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5948919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Vettorazi","original_name":"Daniel Vettorazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e1d9b95675b1e028fd30f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848819,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"McKenzie Stubbert","original_name":"McKenzie Stubbert","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e1dabf0ebf39d927faa93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848819,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"McKenzie Stubbert","original_name":"McKenzie Stubbert","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e1dbf3052a5532f20d618","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848819,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"McKenzie Stubbert","original_name":"McKenzie Stubbert","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e1e1a4b9aaafb8cf1242c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qw1oOEdts8ycNb2XlntMAk5gEA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Tallgrass Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Becquerel (Teaser Trailer)","key":"1107245087","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-08-04T23:08:01.000Z","id":"696e2192f2653b9f6168a2f4"}]}}}
