In order to get time off, Mandel offers to testify against his former partner and best friend Krieger (Matthias Redlhammer). Retired Cop Schimanski (Götz George), now living on a houseboat in Belgium, is asked to transport Mandel across the border to Germany and hand him over to the authorities there. Schimanski agrees reluctantly, but the pair – snobbish Mandel and proletarian Schimanski, who once attempted to book Mandel – make uneven travel-companions. The journey is interrupted when a pair of Romanian hit men tries to kill Mandel. Now tied together by handcuffs, Schimanski and Mandel have to find their way to safety via car, train or on foot.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fH8Qflf1qjVpRghCAdvkzELu6W8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blutsbrüder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Waltz","original_name":"Christoph Waltz","popularity":4.1338,"profile_path":"/jMvLGCVXLaBqjRLf5olyvEucZob.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Klaus Mandel","credit_id":"696d9960ba5117c37df94e05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Götz George","original_name":"Götz George","popularity":0.9149,"profile_path":"/jGnP1ErwHBMobS0yltcpBrNKa2O.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Horst Schimanski","credit_id":"696d9973d500ef9bfc68a28a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":575906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geno Lechner","original_name":"Geno Lechner","popularity":0.6379,"profile_path":"/k36Ly4rBrwkoMDZiilPMs2DuK5F.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ilse Bonner","credit_id":"696d99e4ac35787a6f7fa3cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Virieux","original_name":"Denise Virieux","popularity":0.3157,"profile_path":"/ahgGgg9V0DVXJScVIWurO93HmOe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marie Claire","credit_id":"696d9fa8cb195c9856f123b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5948331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Viktor Minich","original_name":"Robert Viktor Minich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Scholl","credit_id":"696d9fbe2aa443844836b0dd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hajo Gies","original_name":"Hajo Gies","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/eqwoM1BU94CupcK3LIBpTXPBSg.jpg","credit_id":"696d99be962775e541aaad1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5948312,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hansjörg Thurn","original_name":"Hansjörg Thurn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696d99cd3023789f1920d190","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0131577","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":867,"iso_3166_1":"DE","iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/fH8Qflf1qjVpRghCAdvkzELu6W8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1997-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
