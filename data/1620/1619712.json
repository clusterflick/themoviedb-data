Mount Gambier (Berrin) is no longer quiet or sacred. The Blue Lake is fenced, monitored, and treated as a resource rather than a memory. History has changed and Lumy no longer belongs to it. Lost and hunted, Lumy encounters a mysterious living sculpture near the lake, a blue figure formed from stone and water. She names him the Blue Blob. Silent but aware, he recognises Lumy immediately. Bound to the same force beneath Berrin, the Blue Blob becomes her guardian, protecting her at all costs from those who seek to control her and the lake’s power. As Lumy reconnects with Ashton, now a scientist studying temporal fractures, the truth emerges when Lumy vanished from time, the land created its own protector.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Cast in Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
