On his way home, he wanders through nature,rivers, forests, and hills reciting the poem in a lyrical rhythm. When he reaches home, his grandmother sings him a century-old tribal song. Moved by its beauty, he unknowingly carries it within him. The next day, as he is punished outside the classroom, the echoes of the grandmother’s song rise again — symbolizing the fading yet resilient voice of a forgotten culture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Voice of Old","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
