Recently divorced, she raises her teenage daughter Valentina in a cramped, precarious domestic rhythm that feels increasingly unsustainable. During a family therapy session, Valentina announces she wants to move in with her father Julián, whose life appears effortless by comparison.  As she faces an empty house, Abril finds an unexpected spark of possibility in Gabriel, a charming bartender whose warmth offers escape from her carefully managed despair. The budding romance opens the door to a version of herself unshaped by marriage or motherhood, but her own insecurities and unresolved history with Julián threaten to derail her progress. When buried truths about the end of their marriage unexpectedly surface, Abril reaches a breaking point - collapsing under the weight of her grief, professional burnout, and growing isolation.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/x566DR0q6jC59rIKZgBwsWMC8Lg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":286698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Witch Rock","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"When her teenage daughter announces she wants to move in with her   ex-husband, Abril must navigate the wreckage of single motherhood, a complicated new romance, and her own mistakes to find peace with the imperfect life she's built.","title":"ABRIL","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maricarmen Merino","original_name":"Maricarmen Merino","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Abril","credit_id":"696eb68312eb97764baab5ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":469462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Arnaud","original_name":"François Arnaud","popularity":3.6196,"profile_path":"/AdErRIYmckV9Aa9LqaNoMLmMFdt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gabriel","credit_id":"696eb68f6e9bb185a936b8d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hernán Jiménez","original_name":"Hernán Jiménez","popularity":0.2766,"profile_path":"/o5O7MAi2CJVcmaX9drSRhXfJOjO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Julián","credit_id":"696eb69be446c582d168a4e3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hernán Jiménez","original_name":"Hernán Jiménez","popularity":0.2766,"profile_path":"/o5O7MAi2CJVcmaX9drSRhXfJOjO.jpg","credit_id":"696eb6af7b3e123f3668a499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hernán Jiménez","original_name":"Hernán Jiménez","popularity":0.2766,"profile_path":"/o5O7MAi2CJVcmaX9drSRhXfJOjO.jpg","credit_id":"696eb6bcc480113d6e68a916","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37472199","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1493,"iso_3166_1":"MX","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/x566DR0q6jC59rIKZgBwsWMC8Lg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Santa Barbara International Film Festival","release_date":"2026-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"APRIL — Official Trailer","key":"GTsHEi9qum0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2026-01-14T19:03:58.000Z","id":"696eb7c376e683a325aab569"}]}}}
