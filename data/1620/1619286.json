In an ordinary setting of everyday lives, people cross paths and form opinions about one another — often too quickly. Actions are misunderstood, intentions are misread, and individuals are judged not for who they are, but for what is seen in a moment shaped by circumstances.  As time moves through different phases - Samakaalam 1, Samakaalam 2, Kooththukaalam, and Maayakaalam.Perspectives begin to shift. What once appeared right starts to feel incomplete, and what seemed wrong reveals hidden truths. Time slowly exposes the gaps between appearance and reality.  Kaalam reflects on how easily humans judge one another, and how time alone has the power to correct those judgments. It ultimately observes how time alters judgment and changes the way people see one another.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Time decides perception.","title":"Kaalam - The Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
