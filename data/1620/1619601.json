Actually, it was more like Ruweena followed Zoe everywhere, from lunchtime to after school and even to uni, while Zoe kind of… tolerated her.  Then, six years ago, Ruweena disappeared and left Zoe all alone. Zoe likes it better this way. Doesn't she? So why is it that she still keeps the single bed they used to sleep in - why is it that she lets Ruweena kiss her the moment Ruweena reappears?  And why does it feel as if there's something terribly, awfully wrong with the bed they used to call theirs?","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/uZHaRpQqCNezVxluTHRHnP15MmX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2026-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Oxpecker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Martin-Smith","original_name":"Jane Martin-Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Zoe","credit_id":"696e9377eafe7e3224f12a22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Chan","original_name":"Ariel Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ruweena","credit_id":"696e9382492275b2d48fd6b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keyna Wilcox","original_name":"Keyna Wilcox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lian","credit_id":"696e93a9fb4a73c13d8fd76a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corron Spriggs","original_name":"Corron Spriggs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"696e93f1c3f802fb1c7fac53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aryan Misra","original_name":"Aryan Misra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rob","credit_id":"696e93fe3f6de5a4fff95554","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Tan","original_name":"Erin Tan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e94103f6de5a4fff9555f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Tan","original_name":"Erin Tan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e941b8cd061402068aaac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5680628,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Lau","original_name":"Chris Lau","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e942670e15c51f07faa6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5949858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jihyun Huang","original_name":"Jihyun Huang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e9436def51f090f7fac36","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37884542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uZHaRpQqCNezVxluTHRHnP15MmX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Official Selection - QueerFest On Film (Norwich, UK)","release_date":"2026-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
