I shot photos to alongside the footage using cheap Kodak disposable cameras to match the soft and nostalgic look of 16mm. Although overwhelming at times, I’m really happy how this turned out. You just can’t beat the colors and aesthetic of authentic 16mm. No matter how hard you try to digitally emulate it, nothing compares to the experience filming with the real thing.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vJmEDBK7IQp9BTeykuqkjpyrILc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coney Island on 16mm Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Szpot","original_name":"Mike Szpot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696f69593d1a55c705e0aacd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1700,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vJmEDBK7IQp9BTeykuqkjpyrILc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
