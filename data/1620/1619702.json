This video reflects on moments when international solidarity with the Palestinian resistance intersected with solidarity against South African apartheid. These encounters revealed the archive not just as a site of preservation, but as a living network – crossing borders of geography, time, and form.  What futures do these archives hold? What kinds of solidarity will we imagine and practice in a distant future, once these materials have decomposed and become part of us?  As Matter Speaks moves across different traces of the 'Collective Study' programme, summoning a space between permanence and fragility, where archives circulate endlessly.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As Matter Speaks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2934140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Vergès","original_name":"Françoise Vergès","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself (voice)","credit_id":"696ed79e99ca370ea8e0a81a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5950262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rana Issa","original_name":"Rana Issa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself (voice)","credit_id":"696ed7aa946f43e285df0b19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574793,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rasha Salti","original_name":"Rasha Salti","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself (voice)","credit_id":"696ed7feb7db6fd3aeabce18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980224,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kamilya Jubran","original_name":"Kamilya Jubran","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"'About a Human' singer (voice)","credit_id":"696ed85fc66613a70f7ab9aa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Makeba","original_name":"Miriam Makeba","popularity":0.2787,"profile_path":"/b60qlVK0YIWQGkXX7g6GFxTplca.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"'Khawuleza' singer (voice)","credit_id":"696ed87b236d3349c77ab99d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4122724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeongseo Jee","original_name":"Yeongseo Jee","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696ed6bb52a6709be7fe0ed3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hosted by L'international Online","release_date":"2025-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
