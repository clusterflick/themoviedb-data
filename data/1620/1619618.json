The filmmakers accompany her through a typical school day, letting the experienced teacher talk about the challenges and difficulties of her profession and explain her own philosophy of a balanced education that goes beyond the usual norms. But the students also have their say, talking about their diverse experiences and influences during their time at elementary school.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meine liebe Frau Schildt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Meine liebe Frau Schildt - Eine Ode an die Grundschule","type":"full title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathalie David","original_name":"Nathalie David","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e9d6693b8dbcb698fd40d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
