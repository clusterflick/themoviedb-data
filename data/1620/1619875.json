The prejudice that Kenyan women marry a \"mzungu\" (white European) primarily because of his \"wealth\" (from an African perspective) proves to be just as unfounded as the prejudice that African women are the perfect homemakers. Instead, three self-confident young women (and also a German husband) report on the difficult process of mutual adaptation, which they mastered with confidence – and sometimes even \"think in German\" already.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manchmal denk' ich jetzt auf Deutsch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5951049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helmut Schulzeck","original_name":"Helmut Schulzeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696f75883d1a55c705e0ab3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
