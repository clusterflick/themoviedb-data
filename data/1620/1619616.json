On a train journey from Cape Town to Johannesburg, they encounter the fractures of their past: 25 years after apartheid, nothing is as it was, but nothing is as it should be either. The film tells of inner boundaries, unresolved prejudices, unfulfilled hopes, and smoldering conflicts. Everyone is sitting on the same train, but not in the same compartment.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shosholoza Express","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Möller","original_name":"Beatrice Möller","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e9bb94b9aaafb8cf12750","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
