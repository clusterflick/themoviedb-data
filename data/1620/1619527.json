Made up characters & sideplots have been removed to keep the audience engaged in the main story of Bilbo.  The extended editions were used as the base cuts along with additional theatrical footage in order to deliver the most polished end result using all available footage. This cut maintains a status of being its own “Extended Edition,” as to get away with a 4-hour runtime, which blends right in with the LOTR extended editions, making for a perfect marathon of now four films rather than six.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":258,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A fan edit that combines Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy into a more captivating faithfully adapted single-movie experience.","title":"The Hobbit: the M4 Book Edit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Hobbit (M4's Fan Edit) - Official Trailer (HD)","key":"5ZKmXqXxtVc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-10T20:15:14.000Z","id":"696e5f3e983151f7fb7fa9d5"}]}}}
