Elfriede Jelinek, a declared cineaste, wrote her first screenplay with Ramsau am Dachstein. The film, directed by Claus Homschak, takes an unflinching look at Styrian rural and peasant life. Jelinek's text, which is partly spoken on screen by the author herself, deconstructs piece by piece those myths of naturalness that form the basis for the success of the tourist industry. The appeal to give things and circumstances back their history is immediately implemented by Jelinek herself in her interview with the old field hand Josefa.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1976-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ramsau am Dachstein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1896418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claus Homschak","original_name":"Claus Homschak","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696e951f37a87b4217f95633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elfriede Jelinek","original_name":"Elfriede Jelinek","popularity":0.2548,"profile_path":"/GB1KJDPzA5QLAjJfrjxgdIArRx.jpg","credit_id":"696e952c1b311c87c468a7e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
