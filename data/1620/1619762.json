In a country with rich and varied cultural diversity, this colourful  art form is unique due to the religious sanctity attached to it, in which a performer transforms himself into 'GOD' and claims to possess godly powers while believers flock in large numbers to seek blessings from them. In a land where caste-ism has a strong influence on the culture and traditional beliefs, this documentary is an attempt to get a holistic perspective on the truth behind possession and find its relevance in today's society.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ONLY SOMETIMES A GOD","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
