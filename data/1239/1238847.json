But before the nuptials begin, a pair of young lovers flee into the forest to be married, pursued by a pair of not-lovers. There, in the forest, live the fairies whose lives are in turmoil, due to the heated lovers' quarrels between their rulers, Oberon and Titania. Between the fairies, an ass's head, the lovers, a troupe of unsuspecting would-be actors, and a magic flower that can make people fall in love at first sight, it's a merry night of chaos and comedy until everything is put to rights.","popularity":1.9469,"poster_path":"/rSndp4y6JfNQ14SpCjo8yUomFcn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73154,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Shakespeare Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Venora","original_name":"Diane Venora","popularity":0.9988,"profile_path":"/uxDdiEruZMWcih2xuJV1fflEd8c.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hippolyta","credit_id":"65bab4a2f90b19017c076703","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hurdle","original_name":"James Hurdle","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Theseus","credit_id":"65bab50146e75f0183bdeb58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Jay","original_name":"Ricky Jay","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Philostrate","credit_id":"65bab558f90b19017c076783","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2531239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Drischell","original_name":"Ralph Drischell","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Egeus","credit_id":"65bab57afd7aa401848c3208","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Rush","original_name":"Deborah Rush","popularity":0.3275,"profile_path":"/n2CmQoAKP8cQCiYTeLMp1V1WH8V.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hermia","credit_id":"65bab592fd7aa401638b8fa9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Lieberman","original_name":"Rick Lieberman","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Demetrius","credit_id":"65bab5a833a37600c5856a61","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Conroy","original_name":"Kevin Conroy","popularity":0.9307,"profile_path":"/4MVApMiARrecuVjTCPfi6Z7biLW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lysander","credit_id":"65bab5c5fd7aa401638b8fbb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Baranski","original_name":"Christine Baranski","popularity":1.6421,"profile_path":"/q6Zi3BYlmoim1JXXMGgRVS5C87x.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Helena","credit_id":"65bab5e0b7d3520180227d9e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Vinovich","original_name":"Steve Vinovich","popularity":0.3894,"profile_path":"/swwNWlGY50RsHrcyjc6LPokjuyM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Quince","credit_id":"65bab5f35be00e01825d1eed","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey DeMunn","original_name":"Jeffrey DeMunn","popularity":1.0969,"profile_path":"/eSouAAduXaziFpqLw59AG55jtGY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bottom","credit_id":"65bab60290fca30148064d95","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bates","original_name":"Paul Bates","popularity":0.7777,"profile_path":"/cvHI8cb5vKjqaigqwljpsERsv8R.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Flute","credit_id":"65bab64e8c31590162f33389","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
