The community of lay people started the farm on a clay ground, but thanks to their dedication (and a lot of compost), the farm is flourishing every year more and more. Their life and work with plants shows us the metaphores between taking care of the plants and the care of one's inner world and the whole community.  This visually poetic documentary tries to present the lively atmosphere of a special place.","popularity":0.0706,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Farmers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4510445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbora Kinkalová","original_name":"Barbora Kinkalová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ba4efcfd7aa401848be2ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
