He asks his best friend, Apollo, for advice as he struggles to tell if the feeling is mutual. As their friendship develops over time, Kae decides to take the leap of faith and ask her out. However, his lack of confidence turns out to be the least of his worries, as when he shows up to class the following day, Evelyn is nowhere to be seen. Days, weeks and months pass without Evelyn arriving at class and Kae is left to wonder what could have been.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ieciuvGbojtGVRMgul2ul3H06Ly.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's
