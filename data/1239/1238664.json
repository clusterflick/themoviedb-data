Transplanted as a young boy from the violence of the Ugandan civil war to the concrete jungle of London, Joshua has never experienced the privilege that Cass’ family enjoys. Surrounded by the sea and lush natural landscape, the farm is an oasis, brimming with idealistic notions and lively debate amongst Cass’ father, stepmother and their longtime friend of the family, Michael. But Joshua’s warm welcome is short lived, when a sudden act of violent racism at a local summer concert shatters the peace forcing Joshua and those around him to confront the uncomfortable truth of their differences.","popularity":0.9491,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":834,"logo_path":"/zsmK0tDOgvWJiBxuxOHUyJL8W7J.png","name":"Potboiler Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Beacon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Fiennes","original_name":"Ralph Fiennes","popularity":5.2318,"profile_path":"/u29BOqiV5GCQ8k8WUJM50i9xlBf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba573f8c31590162f2ff55","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indira Varma","original_name":"Indira Varma","popularity":1.8148,"profile_path":"/8oH9Mk6OjdhCpDIfAKNyleqlZ18.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba5748e9da69012df2cf88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Babalola","original_name":"Charles Babalola","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":"/eQnrDYXe4aajZCyipX1yPFZGE1j.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba575233a376017b88cf6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2981449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Oliver","original_name":"Alison Oliver","popularity":0.4433,"profile_path":"/ouHdcq6Tgedx4UnJuT3liROzomq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba576090fca3017b08ec12","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Fiennes","original_name":"Ralph Fiennes","popularity":5.2318,"profile_path":"/u29BOqiV5GCQ8k8WUJM50i9xlBf.jpg","credit_id":"65ba56ee3344c6016492f76f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Fiennes","original_name":"Ralph Fiennes","popularity":5.2318,"profile_path":"/u29BOqiV5GCQ8k8WUJM50i9xlBf.jpg","credit_id":"65ba570390fca3017b08eb91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gail Egan","original_name":"Gail Egan","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ba571be9da69017bf62174","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31150648","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
