A reclining water seat holds five still 3D models of idealized black female nudes, postured in the manner of Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Flying above in a silver jumpsuit, Satterwhite spills digital globules of incendiary bubble bath labeled \"Pussy Power\" onto the women's enlarged pubic hair, then animates their bodies with multi-hued lasers. Transported to another realm, one of the women encounters a man who applies \"lipstick for between the legs\" to her. Consequently she sprouts an enlarged male member spraying digital Jacolbys, which another man eagerly spoon-feeds to himself.  By queering his mother's fantastical re-imaginings of culturally proscribed self-care products as well as art historical representations of black female sexuality, Satterwhite pursues what he has described as an alternative, utopian space for performance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reifying Desire 5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
