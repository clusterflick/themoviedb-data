In the film, Mao Chenyu and his father place a ceramic embryo symbolizing reproductive totems into an earthen kiln, metaphorically representing a sexual activity dominated by males.In this symbolic ritual of female conception, the role played by males is merely a myth of passing on the flame, where the absolute dominant figure of the father can actually be replaced by genetically modified, superior seeds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becoming a Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chenyu Mao","original_name":"Chenyu Mao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b899ee5be00e01825a121b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"广州影像三年展","release_date":"2021-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
