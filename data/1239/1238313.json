Bressane considers this work of poetry the Portuguese Finnegan's Wake. The video is a disorganized system of images: an exploration of colors, quotes and sudden inspirations created by the words. A sequence of epiphanies, rigorous in their images. The films cited act as cinematographic scenery, conferring a sense of drama to the movements of the actresses and the readings of the poems.","popularity":0.1179,"poster_path":"/zgBtaYVoBSxk0Cq0VN8nViLNF5V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vídeo
