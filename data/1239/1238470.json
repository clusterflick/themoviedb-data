Days later her husband, Christopher Dawson, a school teacher and famous footballer, moves their teenage babysitter into the family home.\r He claims his wife called him and told him she needed time away, but those closest to Lynette know his story doesn’t add up. They know what the police don’t– that Christopher Dawson was in a secret sexual relationship with the babysitter. And above all, they know that Lynette, a devoted mother, would never abandon her two little girls. That simple conviction propels them on a forty year fight for justice.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/sqbQXgMAzlUViXuKeQzMUHY7NtQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Murder of Lyn Dawson: The Teacher, the Groomer, the Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4509779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedley Thomas","original_name":"Hedley Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b9a7e88c315900c9f11de2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4509724,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Callum Denness","original_name":"Callum Denness","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b9a1745be00e01615a7205","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30304487","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vU3Bn0s6GyIvyUBwZSUTQGZug15.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqbQXgMAzlUViXuKeQzMUHY7NtQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
