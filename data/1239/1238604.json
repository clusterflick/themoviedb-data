Entitled Freeze, it was a huge critical and commercial success, propelling Hirst and the group into the spotlight of the avant-garde.  More than five years later, Hirst exhibits to international acclaim and is regularly derided in the tabloid press.  This portrait of Hirst, which resumes the Omnibus season, is presented as a drug-induced nightmare after Hirst has been put to sleep by a sinister dentist, played by Donald Pleasence. In between interviews with fellow  Freeze artists including Angus Fairhurst , Sarah Lucas and Tracey Emin , Hirst is seen preparing Mother and Child Divided, his work for last year's Venice Blennale. The piece consists of a cow and a calf, each sawn in half, pickled in formaldehyde and exhibited in four tanks.","popularity":0.3902,"poster_path":"/cmlqlXc9xsBK0OCaSKBAi3hKtDH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freeze: But is it Art?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damien Hirst","original_name":"Damien Hirst","popularity":0.1154,"profile_path":"/lCHFMwXW2y2R0iD3B7y0oaljaxV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ba32058c3159017bf4459f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":215824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracey Emin","original_name":"Tracey Emin","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/tN7NYHVXNCDLdJwK4UdVCqUyALP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ba32113344c6014b926bdb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Pleasence","original_name":"Donald Pleasence","popularity":1.211,"profile_path":"/eVJGFCd8ikP6w0XjkuiTbsm65eD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sinister Dentist","credit_id":"65ba322c3344c6016492e204","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angus Fairhurst","original_name":"Angus Fairhurst","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ba324c46e75f0183bd68fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3881787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Lucas","original_name":"Sarah Lucas","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ba3258b7d352018021fd0c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark James","original_name":"Mark James","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a40a75ff34e017c594d00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4037700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cmlqlXc9xsBK0OCaSKBAi3hKtDH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
