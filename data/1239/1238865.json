The film showcases the struggles of the second-generation Koreans as they attempt to navigate the cultural expectations of their parents and their own identity crisis as Americans. The documentary features interviews with second-generation Korean-Americans who share their stories of growing up in a culturally traditional Korean family in America. They speak about their struggles to balance the expectations of their parents, who often hold onto traditional Korean values, and their own desire to assimilate and become more American.","popularity":0.1535,"poster_path":"/a1AruCzj8NRa9I98FdySbiHSD7y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prodigal Korea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Choi","original_name":"Phil Choi","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Young Pastor","credit_id":"65bac47e1fd36f0163717948","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511222,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Johnick Petry","original_name":"Johnick Petry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jesus","credit_id":"65bac48ac144dd017cfd2f6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511220,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terence Kim","original_name":"Terence Kim","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65bac494e18b970162984966","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511220,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terence Kim","original_name":"Terence Kim","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bac3ec2b8a4301611a1246","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alyssa Given","original_name":"Alyssa Given","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bac3dff031740163664b4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511221,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ruthie Grumbine","original_name":"Ruthie Grumbine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bac410d556970183a85c33","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511222,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Johnick Petry","original_name":"Johnick Petry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bac42611c06600e5cea452","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511220,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terence Kim","original_name":"Terence Kim","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bac3fdc144dd017cfd2f12","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Jordan","original_name":"Matthew Jordan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bac4457646fd014abc9bd6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4460984,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abigail Western","original_name":"Abigail Western","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bac45ee18b97017b984936","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26761985","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1AruCzj8NRa9I98FdySbiHSD7y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Prodigal Korea Trailer","key":"6CdRpFnOXFs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-08-20T12:52:33.000Z","id":"65bac3af11c0660162cea44b"}]}}}
