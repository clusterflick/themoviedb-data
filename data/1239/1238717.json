The film is part of the first new set of live-action dramas broadcast in over two years.  The main character is depicted as an unprepared worker as well as a bad husband, playing games in his factory’s computer lab and on his phone at the dinner table. At the end of the 12-minute film, the main character realizes that if he had used his factory’s sci-tech computer lab for learning instead of playing games, he could have solved major issues on his own and become a better worker and citizen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tzTGwOQRniiorWTEsiHwx1Fvvuz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let’s Eliminate This Kind Of Phenomenon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzTGwOQRniiorWTEsiHwx1Fvvuz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
