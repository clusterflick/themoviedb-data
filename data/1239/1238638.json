Despite all of her efforts, she can't get peace as he won't leave her alone. So she hatches a plan. On her social media pages, she posts a picture of another boy, in the hope that this move will put an end to the irritation.  But this move turns out to have unexpected consequences: It turns out that the boy in the picture is actually one of her schoolmates. Named Ji Hyun Ho (Kang Yul), he is a bit of a loose cannon.  Although he is very popular, he dislikes studying - and prefers play. The rest of the school soon learns about the social media post, as news spreads fast in the classroom! This leads to a number of run-ins with ji Hyun Ho. But the more they get to know one another, the closer they get  - causing yet further complications for a whole host of classmates!","popularity":0.2365,"poster_path":"/iiZgZzHpDe8yCDa5Y8mnT2ElTuy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Best Mistake 1: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3237854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Eun-jae","original_name":"Lee Eun-jae","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":"/ggclRiFuMd08Ay098hhC0krK9yt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba4d82fd7aa401848be156","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1989399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kang Yul","original_name":"Kang Yul","popularity":0.309,"profile_path":"/8ixYgBhjRVoLPzZZD74L5vZa2fo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba4d9f5be00e01825cc119","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3059774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park E-hyun","original_name":"Park E-hyun","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/g4eYIi3DiNkYYYhY0RUtox5QG5d.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba4dab90fca301620776d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3059772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoon Jun-won","original_name":"Yoon Jun-won","popularity":0.1953,"profile_path":"/u3D6GhSLvSoBAVb2K8cbnTqrsZ9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba4dd1fd7aa401848be18f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3133990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choe Chan-yi","original_name":"Choe Chan-yi","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":"/vDJHKz5QSnj0yeBzeF7xiGzJTRB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba4dddda9ef2017ca7e0ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3873353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Hyeong Seok","original_name":"Lee Hyeong Seok","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/pR99md1E2ZsQVc4XS6xVkKZj1aP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba4dfeb7d3520180221e44","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iiZgZzHpDe8yCDa5Y8mnT2ElTuy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
