Expressionist hues and breath, artificial lights, yellow street lamps shaping slender natural stages moved by the wind and illuminated by the moon. Black backdrops behind which infinity hides. Two ghostly figures, less protagonists and more evanescent than nervous foliage moved by the breath of time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I prefer darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2886248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salvatore Insana","original_name":"Salvatore Insana","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b8c75190fca3017b06a5da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4031280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Turco Liveri","original_name":"Elisa Turco Liveri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b8c76630f79c0183a9c6f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
