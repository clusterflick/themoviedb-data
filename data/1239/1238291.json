There is a taboo on what happened during the war, you don't talk about it with anyone and certainly not in front of a camera. Requiem for Auschwitz is a sequel, with the most valuable moments from the first film, supplemented with the grandchildren and the creation and performance of the 'Requiem for Auschwitz' by Sinti composer Roger Moreno Rathgeb by the Sinti and Roma Philharmonic from Frankfurt and a Jewish choir in the Berliner Dom in Berlin, during Holocaust Memorial Day. During his visit to Auschwitz in 2020 with four musicians from the Dutch Accompaniment Orchestra, Roger shows them the places that inspired him.","popularity":1.0447,"poster_path":"/7BdnepDl9COfVBS0nAC65gyJnJw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem for Auschwitz - the film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Entrop","original_name":"Bob Entrop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b94cab90fca30162066780","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Entrop","original_name":"Bob Entrop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b94cb78c3159017bf2ab85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Entrop","original_name":"Bob Entrop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b94cbe90fca3014805cd61","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4509142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raoul de Zwart","original_name":"Raoul de Zwart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b94ccf46e75f012eba2c40","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23185006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7O0fdAkf2n45trp40Ga0l7amuFy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":796,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7BdnepDl9COfVBS0nAC65gyJnJw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":2450,"name":"auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp"},{"id":2369,"name":"sinti and romanies "},{"id":254408,"name":"roma"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
