From Northern Finland, Maarit has spent years collecting Elsa Montell’s ‘raanu’ tapestries. Even though for Maarit, the tapestries are full of emotion and meanings, she keeps her collection locked away in a closet. They can only momentarily be admired by others and interpreted by experts. The film asks necessary questions about yearning for beauty and meaning, the joy of owning, and our current relationship to things.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2024-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Kaamos’ – Two Polar Nights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692931,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Gullsten","original_name":"Maria Gullsten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ba8c90da9ef20149a5888c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
