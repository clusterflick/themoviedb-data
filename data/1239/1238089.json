On her road trip to Yeruham, a small town in  the Negev desert, she meets cowboys, herdsmen, hunters and a sheriff, all of them more  pestering than charming. Armed with a Colt and a camera, this shy, sugar-sweet Calamity Jane  succeeds both in softening men’s hearts and gaining their respect. A young woman on a quest,  torn between the desire for closeness and distance. A provocative portrait of tough guys and  unerring pleasure seekers that brings a smile to the face.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yeruham off season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mili Pecherer","original_name":"Mili Pecherer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b8cd4490fca3017b06ae49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
