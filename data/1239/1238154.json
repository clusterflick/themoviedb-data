Film highlights include archival footage of some of the most terrifying and intense airspace battles fought and the intriguing interviews of the veterans who took part in them. This is the story of naval aviation from its conception to the important role it played in battles fought, won, and lost, all the while examining American foreign policy, foreign relations, and long-simmering international conflict. An evocative, powerful, and informative documentary, Wings Over Water is the story behind the story: how and why America developed maritime aviation technology, what it meant to our past, and what it means to our future.","popularity":0.4992,"poster_path":"/btujfzVaBAybBNdtba19dQFqYHZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Varied Directions
