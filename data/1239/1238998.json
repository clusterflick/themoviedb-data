John (Victor Quintero) loses his job and needs money, Jackson (Sam Johnston) loses his drug connections, and needs drugs, and Barry (Michael Blevins) loses his girlfriend, and needs a woman. After many separate attempts to get what they want, they join forces and form a band called Onion Syrup. They recruit a singer named Nicky (Jenna Miller) and before long they're playing in bars around the country. But what John, Jackson, and Barry soon find out, is that what they wanted, they really didn't need, and what they needed, they had all along.","popularity":0.1069,"poster_path":"/lfkWVlZtJgTO2JCG0IZ5kwtdxVN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Onion Syrup","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenna Miller","original_name":"Jenna Miller","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nicky","credit_id":"65bb1873cffeed00c8ac6a79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Johnston","original_name":"Sam Johnston","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jackson","credit_id":"65bb18fed556970183a964d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Quintero","original_name":"Victor Quintero","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"John","credit_id":"65bb1920cffeed0163acc0f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey McIntire","original_name":"Corey McIntire","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Trent","credit_id":"65bb1932e18b97016298def3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Estevez","original_name":"Joe Estevez","popularity":0.469,"profile_path":"/5Ptl8apcuessOd2SpSYdt1lLcZl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bruce","credit_id":"65bb193c11c066017bcfce29","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael P.
