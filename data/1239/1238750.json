Inari Sámi was not spoken in the family after her grandfather went to an orphanage in the 1920s, where speaking his native language was forbidden. As she is becoming a mother, Ulpu begins to wonder about her culture, her linguistic identity, and the generational trauma inherited from her grandfather from a new point of view.
