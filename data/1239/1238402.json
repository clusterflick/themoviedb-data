Evan Rude (voiced by Bruce Currie) resembles a medieval knight with a propeller head, Ropeshair (voiced by John E Hughes AKA Hobart Hughes) has a head that is a cross between a football and an African sculpture. Each figure sees a fish – supposedly the protagonists’ dinner – circling in space. Inside the biscuit, a hardworking ant works for a 'crust’ to feed his family.","popularity":0.1209,"poster_path":"/4jNfLjFjfU928T6LEYJjz2lP0Zt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3536289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Currie","original_name":"Bruce Currie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Evan Rude (voice)","credit_id":"65d8e7c39a358d0163ff1439","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4509473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Evan Hughes","original_name":"John Evan Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ropeshair (voice)","credit_id":"65d8e80ab76cbb0165f111fc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4509473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Evan Hughes","original_name":"John Evan Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b9754ce9da69017bf47260","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4509473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Evan Hughes","original_name":"John Evan Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d6f177e84b79f7e9b8216d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4jNfLjFjfU928T6LEYJjz2lP0Zt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crust (1987)","key":"zFqqXQa4b0U","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-23T18:37:50.000Z","id":"66d6f1a877fed3aeb3b8211e"}]}}}
