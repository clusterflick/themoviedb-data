This art film records her two-year residency, as she created paintings inspired by masterpieces in the National Gallery. She already had a lifelong attachment to paintings in the collection, yet the prolonged contact, particularly with Saint Francis in Meditation by Francisco de Zurbar√°n, led her to notice new details and unexpected nuances which influenced her own art. Through a series of interviews with Watt, this art film documents the formation of this exhibition, with particular emphasis on the creative process.","popularity":0.1092,"poster_path":"/ktraSCSi15boAzmeYuvLtQguoPJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alison Watt: Phantom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4509013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Watt","original_name":"Alison Watt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b93cde33a37601628624cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4509015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Wiggins","original_name":"Colin Wiggins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b93cf933a37601628624e8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4509015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Wiggins","original_name":"Colin Wiggins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b93d09f90b1900e303a2a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1456081","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktraSCSi15boAzmeYuvLtQguoPJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":15478,"name":"art gallery"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
