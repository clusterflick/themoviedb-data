What will remain of our lives after we're gone? Empty spaces, ruins, cities, increasingly overgrown with vegetation, crumbling asphalt: the areas we currently inhabit, now abandoned and decaying, gradually reclaimed by nature. Comprised of a succession of eerily depopulated, dystopian landscapes from across the world, HOMO SAPIENS offers an at once mesmerizing and chilling vision of what a posthuman future might look like.","popularity":0.2715,"poster_path":"/evpIbLI8ebs0jMLntcMt6tv1yc1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10273,"logo_path":"/a3XYUgEqAAuPsNL4xvBZSXGJCt0.png","name":"Filmfonds
