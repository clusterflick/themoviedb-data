He can't help but crank out the occasional false note, just often enough to enrage his listeners and discourage any donations. He dreams of playing a large pipe organ. The juke box drowns him out at a cocktail bar, a church organ drowns him out on a street, pinball machines drown him out at Luna Park. The city's neon lights and commercial posters overwhelm his small art. At the end of the day, he captures the tear of a calliope horse - his sole earnings for the day - which may prove magical.","popularity":0.1218,"poster_path":"/zjEfochqCGd8ieyrzOfBS17c7fP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Absolon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The False Note","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La fausse note","type":"French Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Edebau","original_name":"Werner Edebau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Voice","credit_id":"56bcff14925141734a000a53","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raoul Servais","original_name":"Raoul Servais","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/eB8qlSuKSfDZju8CWFKohJUyT8j.jpg","credit_id":"56bcfe94c3a368180a000acc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raoul Servais","original_name":"Raoul Servais","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/eB8qlSuKSfDZju8CWFKohJUyT8j.jpg","credit_id":"56bcfe88c3a368180a000ac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0262095","wikidata_id":"Q3208647","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zjEfochqCGd8ieyrzOfBS17c7fP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1963-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
