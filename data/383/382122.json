He meets and cooks with both Arabs and Jews in restaurants and at home, who draw on hundreds of years of tradition to create the dishes that define the city, and explores the flavours and recipes that have influenced his palate. Much has changed since his childhood in Jerusalem, and politics is never far away, but Yotam finds that food is sometimes the one area where the different communities can come together. From the humble street foods of hummus and falafel, to the cutting edge of Jerusalem cuisine, Yotam uncovers the essence of what makes the food of Jerusalem so great.","popularity":0.4738,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerusalem on a Plate","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yotam Ottolenghi","original_name":"Yotam Ottolenghi","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"56be063fc3a368180a00444b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Nutt","original_name":"James Nutt","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56be065a9251417347003e12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3499886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215720,"name":"gastronomy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
