The film plays with these different meanings to tell the not strictly chronological story of a fun-loving young woman who joins up with a pair of petty criminals. After they steal a car containing a suitcase full of bank notes, they must go their separate ways. When the characters comment on the action in voiceover, ask how much more time the film is going to give them, quote from “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” or suddenly jump back and forth between tragedy and slapstick in tune with the music, one might think that Pierrot le fou got lost and ended up in Japan.","popularity":0.0983,"poster_path":"/sWdL39qfhIsnfMVJOVX9O28VFP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hanasareru Gang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takayuki Kamura","original_name":"Takayuki Kamura","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kamura","credit_id":"5a00d5b5c3a36807c5004f2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1918888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rie Ito","original_name":"Rie Ito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rie","credit_id":"5a00d5bf925141573a00523f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiro Suwa","original_name":"諏訪敦彦","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/xTXWND8tMN23Ym5fG4dnbh3lpNC.jpg","credit_id":"56c1980fc3a368180a00f7a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10388506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sWdL39qfhIsnfMVJOVX9O28VFP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
