The film shows, by means of 59 works of art, how painting discovered the landscape once it left the strictly religious context behind. Henri storck wrote, \"We have tried to eliminate the artificiality of filming. We have tried to hide the camera in order to immerse the audience in the world of the painting and the landscape that it depicts. We want the viewer to discover the feeling of nature for himself, through the artists.... It is not our ambition to make a critical or informative work.\" This iconic journey from Bosch to Manet and Turner is accompanied by music by Georges Auric.","popularity":0.1163,"poster_path":"/ovynHSWbAr4IGhXkGxdccrvmohw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown Film Unit","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":73098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films d'Ariel","origin_country":""},{"id":1150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris Prociné","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Open Window","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Pigout","original_name":"Roger Pigout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"56bd4e12c3a36817fd001a4f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Storck","original_name":"Henri Storck","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/hbOCma9IFYX4f8iNVegyEw2z5Aa.jpg","credit_id":"56be6d709251417347004cbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4164282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ovynHSWbAr4IGhXkGxdccrvmohw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
