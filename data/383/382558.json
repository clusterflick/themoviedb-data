They end up at the heart of suburbia, in Tel Aviv, at the bourgeois apartment Yali and Boaz. The spacious apartment suddenly seems crowded and small when tensions between the couples begin to mount. The situation is further complicated as Keren's obvious pregnancy adds to the pain of Boaz and Yali, who cannot have children of their own. The shifting relationships between the four serve to examine the tensions and complexities of Israeli society today.","popularity":0.347,"poster_path":"/s9dnSgoWoBPXsLb65dwv94r3HuI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39719,"logo_path":"/fwymnjt9qfiUVi2m820nNbJLV1M.png","name":"Green Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2013-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haven","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hafsakat Esh","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"הפסקת אש","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Ir Miklat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oshri Cohen","original_name":"Oshri Cohen","popularity":0.3121,"profile_path":"/2e98zomLXq3OWi8gUpafQI0i0B8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Motti","credit_id":"56bfdff3925141699c00128c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":569336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lana Ettinger","original_name":"Lana Ettinger","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/eFb96rHvEiHi8dNw0RQtExYnFPq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Yali","credit_id":"56bfe00f9251410bb00034af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nevo Kimchi","original_name":"Nevo Kimchi","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Boaz","credit_id":"56bfe01dc3a36817e40029a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rotem Zissman-Cohen","original_name":"רותם זיסמן-כהן","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":"/nDXEZ8iXFZiKcQtYiITLVQoxSYO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Keren","credit_id":"572bb6069251416cf30005a2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507332,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gal Greenspan","original_name":"Gal Greenspan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56bfe551c3a36817f200a826","department":"Crew","job":"Projection"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577085,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amikam Kovner","original_name":"Amikam Kovner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56bfe488c3a36817e4002a7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577085,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amikam Kovner","original_name":"Amikam Kovner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56bfe476925141375100094b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507332,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gal Greenspan","original_name":"Gal Greenspan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56bfe627925141735900a786","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577287,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itay Marom","original_name":"Itay Marom","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455188d33ad8f01380e2866","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3165442","wikidata_id":"Q52837021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/s9dnSgoWoBPXsLb65dwv94r3HuI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
