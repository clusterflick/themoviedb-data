More than 3000 years have passed since Moses led two million Israelites across the Red Sea and out of the bondage of Egypt. Christians, Jews, and Muslims throughout the world still embrace the accounts of this remarkable event. It is an epic that so fascinated Hollywood director Cecil B. DeMille that he made THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, twice. Now THE EXODUS REVEALED follows the footsteps of the children of Israel in an unforgettable journey of discovery. A journey that reveals physical evidence for the Exodus including: the remains of 3800 year old Hebrew settlements in Egypt's Nile Delta; Egyptian records of the Israelites bondage under Pharaoh; the precise route they may have followed to freedom; their crossing site on the shore of the Red Sea; and the location of Mt. Sinai. THE EXODUS REVEALED brings to light the first significant archaeological \"find\" of the 21st century.","popularity":0.3988,"poster_path":"/smm37bZaxM3evRJK7EZMUiF7DLW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73060,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Mirada Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Search for the Red Sea Crossing","title":"The Exodus Revealed","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John A.
