It was here that the veteran warrior, Sergeant Major Stan Hollis, continued the actions that led to him receiving the only D Day Victoria Cross.Meanwhile, 231 Infantry Brigade,were attempting to recover the situation and fight through German strong points towards Arromanches and Point 54 ridge. These battles lacked the coordination between infantry and tanks achieved by 69 Brigade and were up against field grade German infantry. Hours behind schedule, the village of Ryes was taken. This allowed the much delayed second wave consisting of 56th and 151 Infantry Brigades to deploy and exploit the early successes, reaching the outskirts of Bayeux by dusk. Meanwhile, in the west, the hard pressed 231 Infantry Brigade and 47 Commando continued its advance through enemy held territory to Port en Bessin,  Arromanches and the Longues sur Mer Battery.","popularity":0.2988,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assault on Normandy: Gold Beach - Battle for the Beachhead","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56bf5a3dc3a368180a0096e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56bf5a579251414601002fb8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Stoneman","original_name":"Tim Stoneman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56bf5a6e92514170aa0027fe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Johnson","original_name":"Andy Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56bf5a87c3a36817e4000e32","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hone","original_name":"Richard Hone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56bf5a9f9251417359008aeb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56bf5ab8c3a36817f40090af","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":966,"name":"beach"},{"id":4100,"name":"british army"},{"id":9156,"name":"d-day"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
