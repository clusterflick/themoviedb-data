They decide that there is no reason in trying to fit-in, trying like ‘everybody’ to be ‘somebody’, choosing instead to mock the establishment, as pranksters – calling themselves The Nobodies. Now, what’s their plan? Frankly, they have no idea, until Laer, a transfer student, joins them and takes them on a warpath of self-discovery and no return.  Faeryville is a dystopian teen movie, a stylish coming of age film about youth making sense of their idealistic dreams in our increasingly surreal world - a fictional manifestation of very real issues prevalent in the Post 9-11 world.","popularity":0.0966,"poster_path":"/i4JSIIZA4ShWVLw0JidOtP4njUd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faeryville","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyon Sim","original_name":"Lyon Sim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wDAEhAeDHaP7g42eEIxnwnKFfWZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Poe","credit_id":"56c0536ac3a36817ef00b902","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Samuel Yong","original_name":"Aaron Samuel Yong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/aQyBjpD8U1uvexPwtrdm0SYyV4H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Laer","credit_id":"56c0538ec3a36817e4003ae9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1577190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Graham","original_name":"Tanya Graham","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dkamwotQXUeC4tvUFmQ9eL0vAbT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Belle","credit_id":"56c0539ec3a36817f400bec6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tzang Merwyn Tong","original_name":"Tzang Merwyn Tong","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/z3pgHKrG7pUbLzYn02CrYdfWlo8.jpg","credit_id":"56c052e092514170aa005328","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4522658,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"DexterCJR","original_name":"DexterCJR","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nzGGClETORl5gB1DZ2PJm2atvCe.jpg","credit_id":"65c32c9dcffeed017c51b024","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2709656","wikidata_id":"Q20983844","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XEEc23zAkEhkg12acLeiwHzt6W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i4JSIIZA4ShWVLw0JidOtP4njUd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4565,"name":"dystopia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
