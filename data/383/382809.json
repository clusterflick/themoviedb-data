While helicopter mom Clara hovers over her son Oliver, Alex's daughter Emma feels out of touch with her father's life. Their two worlds collide when Alex proposes that his marketing company shoot a commercial at the kids' school and Clara, up for election as the parent group president, objects the idea. The commercial is Alex's last hope for keeping the company afloat, so in a moment of desperation, he nominates himself for parent group president. In a surprising turn of events, Clara and Alex tie for president and must work together to run the group until the mandated re-vote. The bitter rivals struggle for power, outfoxing each other any chance they get, until the matter of raising their children puts things into perspective. Clara and Alex come to a mutual understanding and even ignite a spark of romance.","popularity":1.6814,"poster_path":"/3ic8v2976A0BNP5pgSUuISCL0Sy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Win, Lose or Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Sevier","original_name":"Corey Sevier","popularity":0.7424,"profile_path":"/wKt1pHZ5Q6kgkmZsNz53lNPzLR3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alex Kramer","credit_id":"56c263149251414a9b000970","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Mattsson","original_name":"Helena Mattsson","popularity":0.8697,"profile_path":"/9b3ZG8KoEZA2MlVIyE4hGH00Cr6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clara Goodwin","credit_id":"56c263249251414a950009b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Hicks","original_name":"Catherine Hicks","popularity":0.7429,"profile_path":"/eGgCeUbtsq69nCPG1w7vU7DzJpO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dot Kramer","credit_id":"56c26332c3a36825f900095e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Velazquez","original_name":"Nadine Velazquez","popularity":0.8962,"profile_path":"/uBWREzpphsFFJuVoT5LoQQ1WNTA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nancy Gander","credit_id":"56c2635cc3a368260d00093d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Grunberg","original_name":"Greg Grunberg","popularity":0.8102,"profile_path":"/ir2QunLf6aTaowpEygbIcjiZLDB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hal Harrington","credit_id":"56c263b2c3a368260b0009e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayla Madison","original_name":"Kayla Madison","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":"/dAnzzrkDwZiQnB4yTOipBpO4YPJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Emma Kramer","credit_id":"5e6bd3f0459ad6001a62897d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2565507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Griffin Kunitz","original_name":"Griffin Kunitz","popularity":0.3314,"profile_path":"/uhRidtdtAzvTkple4MIys29zUtO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Oliver Goodwin","credit_id":"5e6bd40a459ad60011613de8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parker Stevenson","original_name":"Parker Stevenson","popularity":0.6403,"profile_path":"/eGz3oHCKXlsgCo6XT7nIAtD1VcQ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mike Canton","credit_id":"5e6bd420b84f940012b84c62","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1669254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clinton Valencia","original_name":"Clinton Valencia","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Bobby Gander","credit_id":"5e6bd432cedac40017496536","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1737833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devon Michaels","original_name":"Devon Michaels","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/yQIM4CZ2WHFxuf2ZqpP6Vp9gm75.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Jeff Miller","credit_id":"5e6bd444b84f940016b83628","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1339929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Haena Kim","original_name":"Catherine Haena Kim","popularity":0.476,"profile_path":"/uXqd6dR0GC0ffjqAHrvaBY0UcCY.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Margaret Dell","credit_id":"5e6bd456cedac40017496585","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2112652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skylar Fayre","original_name":"Skylar Fayre","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"5e6bd469be6d880011190a34","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2565519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Kilumbu","original_name":"Kevin Kilumbu","popularity":0.1001,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Royce","credit_id":"5e6bd4e51d538600193d0e75","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge-Luis Pallo","original_name":"Jorge-Luis Pallo","popularity":0.2951,"profile_path":"/9cw97jnvm7SvnCTNBWZHXt4clfu.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"5e6bd4f5a9b9a400129e9c12","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":182680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael McCafferty","original_name":"Michael McCafferty","popularity":0.2979,"profile_path":"/mIk1JZCdLaxi0e3s1cR57nulzGB.jpg","credit_id":"56c262ebc3a36825fb0009d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven R.
