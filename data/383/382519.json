Learn how the Declaration of Independunce and the first airplane flew into being. Music rules in three melodic misadventures including Kitty Cat Blues, a furocious Flamenco dance-off and a hip-hoppin` feud between Tom and DJ Jerry. This volume runs hot and cold with some roaring lion lunacy in Africa, tail-kicking kangaroo action in the Australian Outback, chilly silliness involving The Abominable Snowmouse, cockeyed hockey and an all-out snowball war. Get ready to travel to your fun zone with everyone's favorite cat-and-mouse team.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/plHm2NG1O5BgQMj0mF1s5Ps7onA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom and Jerry Tales, Vol. 6","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2821,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/giDBe2hFES5mK8eyv7WBs96MrIE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/plHm2NG1O5BgQMj0mF1s5Ps7onA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
