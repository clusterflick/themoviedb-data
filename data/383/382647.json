'L'italiana in Algeri' (English: 'The Italian Girl in Algiers') is an operatic dramma giocoso in two acts by Gioachino Rossini to an Italian libretto by Angelo Anelli, based on his earlier text set by Luigi Mosca. It premiered at the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice on 22 May 1813. The music is characteristic of Rossini's style, remarkable for its fusion of sustained, manic energy with elegant, pristine melodies.","popularity":0.3991,"poster_path":"/2QnK7QaIPSZ2HjbYNEdQCzTrnk3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rossini: L'Italiana in Algeri - Festival d'Aix-en-Provence","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1577227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christianne Stotijn","original_name":"Christianne Stotijn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Isabella","credit_id":"56c06048c3a368180a00c7ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Mironov","original_name":"Maxim Mironov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lindoro","credit_id":"56c0605e925141699c0024fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgio Caoduro","original_name":"Giorgio Caoduro","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Taddeo","credit_id":"56c060799251410bb000471d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Vinco","original_name":"Marco Vinco","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mustaf√†","credit_id":"56c0608dc3a36817f200bb7f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1577235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisaveta Martirosyan","original_name":"Elisaveta Martirosyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Elvira","credit_id":"56c060a1c3a36817f400c0bc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1577236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabina Willeit","original_name":"Sabina Willeit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Zulma","credit_id":"56c060bec3a36817e4003d08","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruben Drole","original_name":"Ruben Drole","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Haly","credit_id":"56c060d3c3a36817f200bb87","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209744,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angelo Anelli","original_name":"Angelo Anelli","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c05dd5c3a368180a00c745","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gioacchino Rossini","original_name":"Gioacchino Rossini","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/rEOcvlxwKQlOgFpzLPp0Qw6Ig7n.jpg","credit_id":"56c05db492514170aa0054c0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Servillo","original_name":"Toni Servillo","popularity":0.3054,"profile_path":"/h9Js3JQOFD5h4uNtJB2VwSgMcYq.jpg","credit_id":"56c05dfec3a36817ef00bad6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Bataillon","original_name":"Vincent Bataillon","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/nY43j6yQK29cGveoRt16jZNxf3H.jpg","credit_id":"56c05e11925141699c0024a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568209,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Frizza","original_name":"Riccardo Frizza","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c05deac3a36817f400c048","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12906762","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2QnK7QaIPSZ2HjbYNEdQCzTrnk3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":206797,"name":"rossini"},{"id":222119,"name":"opera live performance"},{"id":286760,"name":"toni servillo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Live performance","release_date":"2007-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
