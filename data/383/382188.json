This original four-act version of Edgar, first performed in 1889, was believed lost for over a century when Puccini’s granddaughter Simonetta discovered the score fully intact in 2008. In addition to the third act’s funeral music, which Arturo Toscanini conducted at Puccini’s funeral in 1924, listeners may recognize the duet from the now-restored fourth act, cut by Puccini in subsequent revisions of the work: it bears more than a passing similarity to the third-act duet in Tosca.","popularity":0.1212,"poster_path":"/1iAi34eveS8IWkXeyiFEQs2hUon.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puccini: Edgar (Teatro Regio di Torino)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Giacomo Puccini - Edgar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Cura","original_name":"José Cura","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/exZhRimMA6BxXfEk2bIDOkMmpGK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Edgar","credit_id":"56bccbe8925141734d000022","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amarilli Nizza","original_name":"Amarilli Nizza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fidelia","credit_id":"56bccbfec3a368180200002b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Gertseva","original_name":"Julia Gertseva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tigrana","credit_id":"56bccc15925141734d000030","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Vratogna","original_name":"Marco Vratogna","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/vd8ghO5fqWBBIpERR3cNAkUHGcr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"56bccc449251417356000037","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Cigni","original_name":"Carlo Cigni","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gualtiero","credit_id":"56bccc7f9251417350000040","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorenzo Mariani","original_name":"Lorenzo Mariani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63764a33e8999b008ed335a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3790527,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoram David","original_name":"Yoram David","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63764a70156cc7008217749f","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiziano Mancini","original_name":"Tiziano Mancini","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/kfowQbHkoA32VPcuqxVNacnVncc.jpg","credit_id":"56bcd9659251417359000316","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Puccini","original_name":"Giacomo Puccini","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/mAVi1Op8QWvu6QC63nb6tn1MXDm.jpg","credit_id":"56bcd974c3a3681802000328","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2342694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1iAi34eveS8IWkXeyiFEQs2hUon.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
