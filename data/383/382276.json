There’s what looks at first like a normal sexual triangle: a girl, Pumpgirl, who works in the local garage and thinks she’s one of the lads; a freewheeling jack-the-lad, Hammy, who’s in love with no-one but himself; and a woman, Sinead, neglected, lonely, out looking for a joyride of her own. Three people, one night; a night of sex and violence, resulting in consequences - and not just for them alone.","popularity":0.6036,"poster_path":"/ivBO0hvHfImQ4KMbB4D1c6vqFlp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pumpgirl","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Murphy","original_name":"Gerard Murphy","popularity":0.2885,"profile_path":"/2dzWjg6fsfalFEfCsLjo9mFpCIj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shawshank","credit_id":"56bdb9939251417359002d22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Hughes","original_name":"Geraldine Hughes","popularity":0.3885,"profile_path":"/kBatdBpLl7h1vYnCOw6hRkjbspF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sinead","credit_id":"56bdb99b9251417350002c95","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Heaney","original_name":"Samantha Heaney","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pumpgirl","credit_id":"56c23b5dc3a36825f9000525","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dormer","original_name":"Richard Dormer","popularity":0.8261,"profile_path":"/6zPTBESTihoWHwqj7KK1BuQ1dLY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hammy","credit_id":"56bdb9c29251417350002c9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Ballance","original_name":"Peter Ballance","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56bdb9b79251417350002c98","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1717133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Ford","original_name":"Alexandra Ford","popularity":0.3405,"profile_path":"/r7ZIJtpZ6MaQAIT4mdSGMizPxXV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Deirdre","credit_id":"593a8535c3a368230500c3b0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576238,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Abbie Spallen","original_name":"Abbie Spallen","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56bdb985c3a3681806002c46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1576237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Moore","original_name":"Carol Moore","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/sMND72P2Oz9XHOg7v5KV0zyC80F.jpg","credit_id":"56bdb97ac3a3681806002c3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1308011","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ivBO0hvHfImQ4KMbB4D1c6vqFlp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":605}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Belfast Film Festival","release_date":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
