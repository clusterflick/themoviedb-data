After a series of unexpected events, Max finds himself in increasingly absurd and challenging situations, forcing him to confront his own limitations and fears. With sharp humor and a critique of societal expectations, the film delves into the pressures that shape our lives and the lengths we go to in order to break free from them. A poignant yet quirky tale about bending to life's demands or breaking under the weight of it all.","popularity":0.2807,"poster_path":"/dHTKACue9Yc3IVLGYveMSGFxGBY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51019,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Sky
