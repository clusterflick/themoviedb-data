It is essentially focused on three major voices, soprano, tenor and baritone, with a basso to spice it up. New Yorker Evan Bowers may not be a matinee idol, but he sails into the role with a bright, focused lyrico spinto tenor voice. Renato Bruson was 72 years old in 2008, when he took this role (first sung by him in1989) and it shows, with quite a wobble on many passages; yet his voice commands the stage and rises majestically in the ensembles. And then, Bulgarian Svetla Vassileva, who is not burned at the stake, as in “Maid”, but dies heroically in battle.","popularity":0.3578,"poster_path":"/pzvnia79JOeEvcOhzVYiTSYxu09.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42411,"logo_path":"/9osTYTduHkM6Il6XixUTfdNcaoP.png","name":"C Major Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giovanna d'Arco","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetla Vassileva","original_name":"Svetla Vassileva","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/em84Y4NBKFLQbeD2Xl4HJyC6yJI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Giovanna","credit_id":"56bb7154c3a3681ef5000336","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Bowers","original_name":"Evan Bowers","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Carlo VII","credit_id":"56bb716892514111ea0002dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renato Bruson","original_name":"Renato Bruson","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":"/jghojBUxT4NGj91i0a5D1Ie1sFH.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Giacomo","credit_id":"56bb717cc3a3681efa0002ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurizio Lo Piccolo","original_name":"Maurizio Lo Piccolo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Talbot","credit_id":"56bb7191c3a3681ef7000320","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Petroni","original_name":"Luigi Petroni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Delil","credit_id":"56bb71a4c3a3681f04000302","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Bartoletti","original_name":"Bruno Bartoletti","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/8eZwgrjycjWshcMLrhyCeTGUdGy.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5de82b283faba0001914e304","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Bartoletti","original_name":"Bruno Bartoletti","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/8eZwgrjycjWshcMLrhyCeTGUdGy.jpg","credit_id":"56bb6f26c3a3681efa00029f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiziano Mancini","original_name":"Tiziano Mancini","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/kfowQbHkoA32VPcuqxVNacnVncc.jpg","credit_id":"56bb6f4bc3a3681f01000285","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162692,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Friedrich Schiller","original_name":"Friedrich Schiller","popularity":0.2626,"profile_path":"/twQVdSrjsXD6yWAzWEGLtoMKVJm.jpg","credit_id":"56bb7029c3a3681efa0002d1","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"56bb6effc3a3681f070002a1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383476,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Temistocle Solera","original_name":"Temistocle Solera","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56bb6f1192514111e70002c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Lavia","original_name":"Gabriele Lavia","popularity":0.3161,"profile_path":"/xjLiYd6fHszM8w5NiGBcSKd1mk9.jpg","credit_id":"56bb6f3992514111df000291","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11132416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vRdeiPFPG8NbpzpojgTyAy9Fxcd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pzvnia79JOeEvcOhzVYiTSYxu09.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222119,"name":"opera live performance"},{"id":222293,"name":"tutto verdi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Live performance","release_date":"2008-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Tutto Verdi.
