The Seamangeun Reclamation changes the social fabric of the communities - and various factions struggle both against the government and each other. One such conflict arises, for example, between the shellfish farmers and the ship owners over questions of compensation for the reclaimed land. On its part, the government proves to be both insensitive to the positions of the islanders and deliberately divisive.","popularity":0.0524,"poster_path":"/eLCxwkVyNxDwBEoSjYw9UbKGD2q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2009-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Live - Save Our Saemankum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"살기 위하여-어부로 살고 싶다","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Kang-gil","original_name":"Lee Kang-gil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xk9nEFVdKfBaW6xnjYuui5vhDWO.jpg","credit_id":"6461f3db6e0d72017b31554b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Kang-gil","original_name":"Lee Kang-gil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xk9nEFVdKfBaW6xnjYuui5vhDWO.jpg","credit_id":"6461f7696e0d72013dccc140","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Kang-gil","original_name":"Lee Kang-gil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xk9nEFVdKfBaW6xnjYuui5vhDWO.jpg","credit_id":"6461f7706e0d7200ff4c37df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14680004","wikidata_id":"Q12600091","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1581,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/eLCxwkVyNxDwBEoSjYw9UbKGD2q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1054}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Suwon Human Rights Film Festival","release_date":"2006-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2007-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
