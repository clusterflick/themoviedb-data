It explores Aileen Hunt's life, her illness and working life and the effects that her MS has on her, her family and particularly her husband Simon. It shows their journey together to Mexico to get treatment which will hopefully halt the progression of this illness in it's current state. Raising awareness of this disease and its treatment is a fundamental goal which I wish to achieve with this documentary.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/v4ZyoFqGbyAhInkVx7mEzfnwAv1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188194,"logo_path":"/pQJd8O15nrFgLjDYEjfCut443ll.png","name":"Black Thistle Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MS, Mexico & Me: Aileen's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aileen Hunt","original_name":"Aileen Hunt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6397430ad05a03007d59b00d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Hunt","original_name":"Simon Hunt","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6397431979b3d40080f8369e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruiz-Argüelles","original_name":"Ruiz-Argüelles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63974335a1a9ba00a0ffc99b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098596,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Calum Menzies","original_name":"Calum Menzies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dWHNFkGxR25Q7NRU78jMWsXK6iW.jpg","credit_id":"63974367d05a0300cf2a9c43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098596,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Calum Menzies","original_name":"Calum Menzies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dWHNFkGxR25Q7NRU78jMWsXK6iW.jpg","credit_id":"6397439479b3d4008adc52df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827521,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten MacGregor","original_name":"Kirsten MacGregor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639743df8a88b20082dc412c","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827521,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten MacGregor","original_name":"Kirsten MacGregor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639743fa8a88b2007d939ef1","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gordon Menzies","original_name":"Gordon Menzies","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6397440f79b3d4007a2d86a9","department":"Production","job":"Production Runner"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098596,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Calum Menzies","original_name":"Calum Menzies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dWHNFkGxR25Q7NRU78jMWsXK6iW.jpg","credit_id":"6397436f79b3d400a0bbaaf1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827523,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Jones","original_name":"Matt Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639743a92cefc200a2fe19cf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827525,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon Stacey","original_name":"Jon Stacey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639743bfa1a9ba007df95fb1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827523,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Jones","original_name":"Matt Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639743d1a1a9ba007df95fc0","department":"Camera","job":"Aerial Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827519,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alistair Scott","original_name":"Alistair Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6397437f2cefc20084b5a270","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827521,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten MacGregor","original_name":"Kirsten MacGregor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6397438aa1a9ba0087303871","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8783124","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4ZyoFqGbyAhInkVx7mEzfnwAv1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MS, Mexico & Me: Aileen's Story -
