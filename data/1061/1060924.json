From their humble beginnings as a small backyard sanctuary, we follow founders Zina and Michael Goodin, their amazing staff, and the gang of one hundred plus senior pooches, as they grow and settle into a brand new 20,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility. You’ll meet the dogs, and the people who fostered them and gave them a reason to wag their tails. It’s a tale of compassion and commitment, where love knows no bounds and as Zina likes to say, “The sky is the limit.” Old Friends: A Dogumentary, a film about a place where love never grows old.","popularity":0.1552,"poster_path":"/15dtkTHcBO98ZYYY2DTgyOy42Ay.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Friends: A Dogumentary","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829123,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sydni Frisch","original_name":"Sydni Frisch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6398787279b3d400a0bc5a0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"6398785ea0f1a200c88214ed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"6398785279b3d4007a2e35e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18483946","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"OldFriendsADogumentary","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A8cBtstzZbMroqzU2i8Cpu3IKYP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":5.644,"height":568,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t1Hop2a28B5fvrimnWcNKGuDVoO.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3206}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1043,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/15dtkTHcBO98ZYYY2DTgyOy42Ay.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":695},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1043,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bPzrhoPqeYTrATd1bp3WEtd0i4g.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":695}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OLD FRIENDS A DOGUMENTARY - Trailer 2022","key":"g4CvfIp_tNY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-14T02:53:35.000Z","id":"63987766d05a03007d5a6512"}]}}}
