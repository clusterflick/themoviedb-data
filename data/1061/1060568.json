Call her crazy, but under the larger-than-life exterior, this Texas tornado is a woman with resilience, fierce intelligence, and an enduring love for Momma.","popularity":0.3164,"poster_path":"/seo6qxqqeXEryaMVVsscqWqopwa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graybeard Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"\"Way out yonder, on a splinter of land jutting into the bay, there lives a Baroness...\"","title":"The Baroness from Kaufman County","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Partridge","original_name":"Sarah Partridge","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"63974e9f79b3d400a0bbb0bb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2308293,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brandon Gray","original_name":"Brandon Gray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639747048a88b20091ab0d33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jess Decelle","original_name":"Jess Decelle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63974715a0f1a200a099338a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24054182","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/seo6qxqqeXEryaMVVsscqWqopwa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t2rlxz20HBoiKF54NzdI21AkyUZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
