Y. Smith. It is the end result of a tokusatsu film production course taught by Yagi for the online subscription service Narō. Though only about 6 minutes of footage was cut together and shown at Tokyo Comic Con on November 24, 2022, Yagi and his crew intend to put proceeds from course subscriptions toward getting AKARI made as a feature film or television series. It stars the titular Akari, a woman turned giant with alien technology, fighting off a berserk cybernetic monster.","popularity":0.4969,"poster_path":"/lpVSB4ZYPX4YN0hxkfw2dgrhjNC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Narō","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AKARI","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1501758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanon Miyahara","original_name":"宮原華音","popularity":0.6858,"profile_path":"/sIbJsSBd9AeVWvrMsCD7XCSJL1f.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Akari","credit_id":"639648287304b5008c113360","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuki Hamatani","original_name":"Kazuki Hamatani","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pythagodon","credit_id":"6396483a8a88b20082dbae6f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2394030,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matt Frank","original_name":"Matt Frank","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639649b579b3d40080f7b0d5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3826602,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Akihiko Iguchi","original_name":"井口 昭彦","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/fhOPqC7EZHqUrgF8kMVJtLqHlCz.jpg","credit_id":"639649c779b3d4007a2cf7ea","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takeshi Yagi","original_name":"八木毅","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":"/jUcEhDZB1fkAjtd1JD8PMUlwS1Z.jpg","credit_id":"639648ac7304b5008469eb9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takeshi Yagi","original_name":"八木毅","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":"/jUcEhDZB1fkAjtd1JD8PMUlwS1Z.jpg","credit_id":"639648b8a0f1a200c880e90d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826589,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Todd Silverstein","original_name":"Todd Silverstein","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639648c57304b500b86069af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826590,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jordan A.
