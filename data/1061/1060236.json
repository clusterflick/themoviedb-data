Stuperbee. Mr. Bigs. While he goes by many names, the 6’6” man behind a mysterious mask, coveralls and white Telecaster is here to tell all in this no-holds-barred documentary from FRET12. From his early days in Iowa, to touring the globe playing massive stadiums, Jim Root has seen it all. In addition to being the yin to Corey Taylor’s yang, Jim has also crafted a guitar style that gels effortlessly with fellow guitarist Mick Thompson, creating the sound that is undeniably Slipknot. While he no longer plays with Stone Sour, Jim also has plenty to teach about his songs written for that band as well, including plenty of classic solos. If you are looking to learn all about writing songs in lower tunings, heavy mosh-ready riffs, intricate solos, and modern metal songcraft, Jim is hands down the teacher for you.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":304,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jim Root: The Sound and the Story","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Root","original_name":"Jim Root","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"639647f379b3d40091274cd4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Brueckmann","original_name":"Chuck Brueckmann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6396477f8a88b200a7647519","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5640106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
