They follow the text, in verse and prose, used by strolling players five centuries ago when a miracle play meant the portrayal of the mystery of Christ's birth. The story is divided into scenes, with costumes and settings patterned after biblical times. Between acts a children's \"angel choir\" sings familiar Christmas carols to introduce each scene.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nativity Cycle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":123773,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fergus McDonell","original_name":"Fergus McDonell","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6397fe5f2cefc2008ca81292","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1956-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
