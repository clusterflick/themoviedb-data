Young Hoodoo has bought his parents cigars and a brooch for Christmas. As he opens his presents expectantly on Christmas morning, he keeps his hopes up until the end--will the next gift from Santa Claus be a pair of skates, a puppy dog, Noah's Ark, a sleigh or a drum...? When none of the gifts meets his expectations, he decides to do things differently next year.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/e37bvrHzdYn71mlS0X30tU9XxXI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoodoo McFiggin's Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Maitland","original_name":"Alan Maitland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63aa35f5aaec7100ea09e1d1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Szasz","original_name":"Eva Szasz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa3644aaec71008678b9cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313505,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Leacock","original_name":"Stephen Leacock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa3662072166007f6a5b31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Munro","original_name":"Grant Munro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa368fb3316b00cfbd6dde","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223467","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e37bvrHzdYn71mlS0X30tU9XxXI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
