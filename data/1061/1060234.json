It was produced for the \"Jump Out! Super Heroes\" event at the Takarazuka Family Land theme park, where it premiered on the day of the event's opening on March 18, 1989.[1] The film is not known to have been released again until almost a full decade later in 1998, when it was included as a bonus feature on the second volume of the series' LaserDisc releases. It has since been carried over to Toho's subsequent video releases, including the second volume of their 2005 DVDs, and the fourth volume of the discs' 2018 Toho Masterpiece Selection reissues.","popularity":0.2347,"poster_path":"/5PtU3hUDqMgiNmLyMPwI99HDd1y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":882,"logo_path":"/fRSWWjquvzcHjACbtF53utZFIll.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cyber Cop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115944,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryomei Shirai","original_name":"白井良明","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639645e9d05a030085cb29e0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563679,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kazuo Sagawa","original_name":"佐川 和夫","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/yMw9s7puaIYP1X6R3dfQLn9ZF9W.jpg","credit_id":"6396455e7304b500b860690c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555820,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hitoshi Ishiwatari","original_name":"Hitoshi Ishiwatari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639645a49f5dfb00b6af2651","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Nishikawa","original_name":"西川弘志","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639645bda1a9ba00942fd427","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitsuru Toriumi","original_name":"Mitsuru Toriumi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63964585a1a9ba00e207130c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3461306,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuho Iwasato","original_name":"Yuho Iwasato","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639645db79b3d40080f7b025","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisuke Inoue","original_name":"井上大輔","popularity":0.2125,"profile_path":"/3bJRnZydWDTC1O9dQhYOCcuVj6d.jpg","credit_id":"639645cba0f1a200c880e861","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3572167,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Haruhiko Hashimoto","original_name":"Haruhiko Hashimoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63964573d05a0300ae501385","department":"Crew","job":"Stunt Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5PtU3hUDqMgiNmLyMPwI99HDd1y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1989-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
