His little opera ensemble is about to perform Ariadne auf Naxos, a grandiose opera of his own making, at the home of a wealthy man. But the very same evening a troupe of players led by the colourful Zerbinetta will also perform, and the two ensembles fight over who is to go first. The threat of cuts is driving the earnest composer to near breakdown. This is the comic prologue to the opera about Ariadne that the audience will be attending after the intermission.  After Elektra and Der Rosenkavalier, the composer Richard Strauss and the librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal were opera’s foremost duo in the first decades of the 20th century. They chose to follow up the two successes with a challenging experiment: an opera about an opera and a story about artistic creation. Ariadne auf Naxos is metafiction in its most enjoyable form, an opera that makes the audience aware of its own role in an entertaining way.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/6DGppfxOJOBhsZg4yQQOrUYWOMs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175205,"logo_path":"/1tTbcm3H0n7HJo8iBJ3rhav8JuU.png","name":"Kungliga Operan","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2022-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ariadne auf Naxos - RSO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas T Olsson","original_name":"Andreas T Olsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"639861888a88b200a765b602","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ola Eliasson","original_name":"Ola Eliasson","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6398618f8a88b20082dce839","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Rudström","original_name":"Johanna Rudström","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"639861972cefc200c38b66dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3829034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Weinius","original_name":"Michael Weinius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6398619e2cefc2007c201e4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesper Taube","original_name":"Jesper Taube","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"639861a6a0f1a2007b39c089","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Gilbert","original_name":"Alan Gilbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639861b6a1a9ba00e2083e93","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Jakhelln Semb","original_name":"Katharina Jakhelln Semb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639861c0a0f1a200873a3d73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6DGppfxOJOBhsZg4yQQOrUYWOMs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
