But he doesn't spare his own community either by accusing many gays of being conformist soft-spoken people; and by outing some prominent homosexuals against their will, he has made many enemies. For the younger generation of LGBTIQ activists, Rosa von Praunheim is still known as a figure from the early phase of the queer movement, but as a white cis man he hardly gets a hearing there. However, Rosa does not want to argue and theorize, but above all to live out his creativity. Sometimes narcissistic, sometimes angry and combative, sometimes anxious - and always with his own style. Companions such as the comic book creator Ralf König, the producer Regina Ziegler and the New York publicist Brandon Judell pay tribute to the artist and activist Rosa von Praunheim, who calls himself a “lucky child” because he was mostly able to do what he felt like doing.","popularity":0.1677,"poster_path":"/h5lOrtqLYwVXIalyDVTvl8IIhEW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glückskind: Der schwule Filmemacher Rosa von Praunheim ist 80","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Enfant chanceux : Le cinéaste gay Rosa von Praunheim a 80 ans","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa von Praunheim","original_name":"Rosa von Praunheim","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/8KtgcbZmwtvyjATkPgGCD02GxPw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"639800462cefc200c38b2309","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2301123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Giacopuzzi","original_name":"Marco Giacopuzzi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6398003c79b3d4008adcab28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23829392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jqZ8CpRtoVd9liCM96f6kv0QM2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/h5lOrtqLYwVXIalyDVTvl8IIhEW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
