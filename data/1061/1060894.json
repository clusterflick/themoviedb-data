These colors are overlaid onto images of the famous canyons of the American Southwest: Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon. As is common with travel films, Flaming Canyons ranges across multiple scenic highlights, condensing a trip that would take several days in person into a running time of just over 13 minutes on screen. The purpose of such films was two-fold: to promote actual tourism to the region, and more broadly, to provide a vicarious tourist experience for the audience in the movie theater. The film alternates between images of natural landscapes (rock formations, cliffs, canyons) and images of recreation (touring cars, the Zion Hotel, the Grand Canyon Hotel).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kSjhZHi2HIO2LbiUZnaObWSPtJj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flaming Canyons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1049072","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kSjhZHi2HIO2LbiUZnaObWSPtJj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1961}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
