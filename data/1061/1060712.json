Saman is a newly married young man. Arash is an eighteen-year-old high-school dropout. All three are transsexuals living in Iran. INSIDE OUT features intimate conversations with Maria, Saman, and Arash, allowing them to tell their stories, including the lifelong struggle to come to terms with their gender dysphoria, how this mind/body conflict has affected their everyday behavior, and the impact of hormone therapy and sex-change surgery on their lives. The film also includes revealing interviews with a Muslim cleric, who explains that the majority of Iran's religious leaders consider transsexuality to be a human rights issue and therefore support gender reassignment surgery; a psychiatrist, who explains the difference between homosexuality and transsexuality and how the condition cannot be cured psychologically; and a surgeon, who discusses the nature and the difficulties of the required surgery.","popularity":0.0938,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3828500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zohreh Shayesteh","original_name":"Zohreh Shayesteh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6397ca6d79b3d40080f867d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0800089","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
