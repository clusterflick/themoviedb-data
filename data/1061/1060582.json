The investigations were spurred on by a number of articles that blamed comics for the rise in juvenile delinquency in post-war America. Chief among  the critics was Doctor Frederic Wertham, whose book, \"Seduction of The Innocent\" has been blamed for nearly single-handedly crippling the entire comics industry.  \"Confidential File\" was aired in 1955, after the senate hearings and the formation of the Comics Code, but it serves as a perfect example of how the media reacted to the comic book industry, and sought a scape goat by blaming the comic book publications for society's own lack of responsibility in raising its children.","popularity":0.3693,"poster_path":"/s0cPqdyGTBNQoqu5SwxkdwpKUuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188197,"logo_path":null,"name":"KTTV Los Angeles","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seduction Of The Innocent","title":"Confidential File: Horror Comics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estes Kefauver","original_name":"Estes Kefauver","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63975526a0f1a200873993cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1745288,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Coates","original_name":"Paul Coates","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"639758f92cefc20084b5ac6d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irvin Kershner","original_name":"Irvin Kershner","popularity":0.2946,"profile_path":"/imtFUtcASoh2e1Emtt62UuFkIWA.jpg","credit_id":"6397589cd05a0300f85a4cb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2260554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsE76ZnTzLis3VzaXsR8jN2GpGe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s0cPqdyGTBNQoqu5SwxkdwpKUuP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Z2WMXCVHYt2EmJW8DaCJcbEmMz.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5451,"name":"comic book"},{"id":14857,"name":"juvenile delinquent"},{"id":192051,"name":"ec comics"},{"id":308662,"name":"pearl clutching"},{"id":308737,"name":"moral outrage"},{"id":308803,"name":"comics code authority"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1955-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Confidential File: Horror Comic Books!","key":"GI8IJA8kdkI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-04-06T17:35:32.000Z","id":"6397540ba0f1a200a0993979"}]}}}
