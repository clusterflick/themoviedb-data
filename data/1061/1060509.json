Dressed in a red hooded outfit which suggests his low rank, Virgil has been employed to assist the efficient auto-prof: a computerised English instructor. The machine unleashes utilitarian English classes pitched way below its students' levels in order to guarantee passes and maintain the school's reputation. Virgil becomes taken by a student, Marie, who somehow manages to stir him from the drudgery of his apathetic classroom role. He fails one of the student's test in his class and is ordered by his superiors to amend the score if he wishes to keep his position, taking into account the dwindling jobs market. He is bullied, harassed and intimated into complying with a system that is decayed, corrupted and abusive towards its employees.","popularity":0.1251,"poster_path":"/kB1GGXFjjJ8dvKYeNIGbobXLRe4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63823,"logo_path":"/4Y5tWYPImHLZdwuj18a73n7faxk.png","name":"Blue John Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not only will computers rob us of our dignity, but also our very core.","title":"The English Lesson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Hayward","original_name":"Tim Hayward","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Virgil","credit_id":"63971ef5a1a9ba007df94c05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laila Rose Bouromane","original_name":"Laila Rose Bouromane","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"63971effa0f1a2007b39135a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gannon","original_name":"John Gannon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bob Mangle","credit_id":"63971f0979b3d4008adc40ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1407056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommie Grabiec","original_name":"Tommie Grabiec","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":"/3ifZfcsZleVo9yyD4Vx3tbwDoPn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Butch","credit_id":"63971f178a88b200c4e28219","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Gambetta","original_name":"Gabriel Gambetta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mateo","credit_id":"63971f23a1a9ba0094304412","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adi Loya","original_name":"Adi Loya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Angela","credit_id":"63971f2ba0f1a200a0992025","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudie Nedelec","original_name":"Claudie Nedelec","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ms. Clark","credit_id":"63971f58a1a9ba00c8791294","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Cornish","original_name":"Anna Cornish","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"63971f6279b3d4007a2d73b1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhys Whiteside","original_name":"Rhys Whiteside","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"63971f6e2cefc200a2fe080f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandro Fasolo","original_name":"Sandro Fasolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Teacher","credit_id":"63971f798a88b20082dc2d7d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2878245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandra Costa Alvarez","original_name":"Alejandra Costa Alvarez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Alexandra (Girl in Street)","credit_id":"63971f8da1a9ba007df94c73","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1513033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Herbert","original_name":"Paul Herbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Man in Street","credit_id":"63971f9ba1a9ba00a0ffb704","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1513033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Herbert","original_name":"Paul Herbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63971fc62cefc200d173861c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1513033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Herbert","original_name":"Paul Herbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63971fcfa1a9ba008730266d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827313,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Su Hou","original_name":"Su Hou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63971fe8a1a9ba0094304481","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1513033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Herbert","original_name":"Paul Herbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63971ff2a1a9ba009430448d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1456211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"C.J.
