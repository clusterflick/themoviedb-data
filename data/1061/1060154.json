Wingsuit base jumping is an airborne extreme sport. The pilot takes off from high peaks above cloud level navigating back to earth close to treetops and past cliffs at speeds up to 240 kph. American Ellen Brennan is the fastest flying woman in the world and considered a true artist in the community. Residing amongst the mountains in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, she spends her days and sometimes nights above the clouds looking for suitable cliffs from which she can soar. The wingsuit flyers refer to these cliffs as \"exits\".","popularity":0.212,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A philosophical and poetic documentary about a female wingsuit base jumper.","title":"Looking for Exits: Conversations with a Wingsuit Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Brennan","original_name":"Ellen Brennan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Protagonist","credit_id":"639615869f5dfb00916d74b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678577,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kristoffer Hegnsvad","original_name":"Kristoffer Hegnsvad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6396159ea0f1a200c880dbb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283379,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Albrechtsen","original_name":"Peter Albrechtsen","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639615e02cefc200c38a2b41","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2499715,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Signe Tora Munk Bencke","original_name":"Signe Tora Munk Bencke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639615c59f5dfb00b6af1909","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302752,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anne Gry Friis Kristensen","original_name":"Anne Gry Friis Kristensen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639615f1a0f1a2007b3892be","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Alsted","original_name":"Peter Alsted","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639615b3a0f1a2008738defb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3641233,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Colcer","original_name":"Paul Colcer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bRJAx20nOaW79QCNmtKPpXkvWu6.jpg","credit_id":"639615d68a88b2007d9313be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512665,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heikki Kossi","original_name":"Heikki Kossi","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":"/6VipnMFz9whg3WKRGld7KJDGTlo.jpg","credit_id":"64401f28b0ba7e04a313439e","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10286,"name":"wingsuit"},{"id":229348,"name":"basejump"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
