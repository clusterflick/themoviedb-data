Janet and her fellow muralists are today invited to restore their most monumental work almost 25 years after its completion: the Quiabu mural at the Esteli military base. Showing different historical moments through extensive use of archival materials and new footage, La Paz del futuro paints an \"on the road\" portrait of what remains of a series of murals and a revolution, and at the same time proposes a reflection on public art, politics and the passage of time: a look to the past from the future.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/A7jRaSlGTQqhdLJWj4WlnguViG8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"NI","name":"Nicaragua"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Paz del Futuro","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Pavone","original_name":"Janet Pavone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"639622318a88b200c4e2032c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddy Hernandez Castro","original_name":"Freddy Hernandez Castro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6396223c2cefc20084b50c30","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Michilini","original_name":"Sergio Michilini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"639622448a88b2008a302bf8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Barrenechea","original_name":"Jon Barrenechea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6396224c7304b5008c112a3d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Hopewell","original_name":"Daniel Hopewell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"639622537304b500934fb9c6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121386,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luca Previtali","original_name":"Luca Previtali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6396227b2cefc200c38a2f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Clerici","original_name":"Francesco Clerici","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6396226e2cefc20084b50c3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22770982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1969,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A7jRaSlGTQqhdLJWj4WlnguViG8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1378}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festa del cinema di Roma","release_date":"2022-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
