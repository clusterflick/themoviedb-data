It depicts the strength and courage of America's youth, while examining how these men and women dealt with being thrust into this brutal war. The film includes interviews with war veterans, both American and Japanese, from all branches of the military. It features testimony from medics, nurses, dog handlers, as well as Japanese-Americans who were imprisoned at internment camps in the United States. The film also includes a first hand account of the tragic impact of the atomic bomb on Japanese citizens. Among the veterans who appear is Zenji Abe, a Japanese veteran who flew the mission to bomb Pearl Harbor, and retired General Paul Tibbets who flew the mission to bomb Hiroshima.","popularity":0.5124,"poster_path":"/kL23b7Wdf30uqpbpi5TTBMVC8sQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3486,"logo_path":"/4msGGjTX9E6VJ4fxcF6IkH2W36o.png","name":"DreamWorks Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Pearl Harbor to Nagasaki","title":"Price for Peace","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El precio de la paz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Moll","original_name":"James Moll","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/8E0C2frUUhkPCRm3K5yAq2vDGLI.jpg","credit_id":"545572efc3a3682be9002a9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25289,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harris Done","original_name":"Harris Done","popularity":0.1533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545573120e0a2648d6005288","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380603,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Kreitman","original_name":"Richard Kreitman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54557333c3a368146f005054","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nathan Wang","original_name":"Nathan Wang","popularity":0.4325,"profile_path":"/9lLus0ucZaoCwpU6mjwjPyaVe95.jpg","credit_id":"545573510e0a2648d2005575","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Spielberg","original_name":"Steven Spielberg","popularity":2.959,"profile_path":"/tZxcg19YQ3e8fJ0pOs7hjlnmmr6.jpg","credit_id":"593fe7a49251414af200f59a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0298506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Kj7EjjbFmpnW4dagWeYs2tmmOL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wF6V0tiJIlOcRL0gak2WgX0lAIf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kL23b7Wdf30uqpbpi5TTBMVC8sQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"2002-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Price for Peace (2002) Film Clip","key":"PyfBZsex-tA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2020-04-13T20:45:31.000Z","id":"6023d1180e597b003da7d544"}]}}}
