Humanity's continued survival depends on an anti-radiation drug only available on planet Delta Three, which has been taken over by Omus, a brilliant but mad mechanic who places no value on human life. Omus wants to come to the Moon to rule and intends to attack it by ramming robot-controlled spaceships into the domes. Dr. John Caball, his son Jason, Jason's friend, Kim, and a robot named Sparks embark on Caball's space battlecruiser on an unauthorized mission to Delta Three to stop Omus.","popularity":2.7611,"poster_path":"/yXKgpRHS65NrsEDKa6dXgrcpzpW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17671,"logo_path":null,"name":"CFI Investments","origin_country":""},{"id":17672,"logo_path":null,"name":"SOTTC Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1979-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beyond the earth...
