Death threats, hate mail, bribes, and lawsuits were all candidly captured on film.","popularity":2.0948,"poster_path":"/v3S9N3FG7aejJDmttT5pRVFEV5l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minority Films LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death Threats, Bribery, and Family Values.","title":"This Divided State","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3231401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Anderson","original_name":"Kay Anderson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"613d7ec1322b2b008921891f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3231402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Bassi","original_name":"Jim Bassi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"613d7ed4c68b69002bca45dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3231403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Vreeland","original_name":"Sean Vreeland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self - Student Petitioner","credit_id":"613d7ef3c68b690044acc2bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Nigro","original_name":"Michael Nigro","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"613d7f14af95900043482064","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth F.
