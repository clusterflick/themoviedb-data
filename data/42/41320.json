The story of a true American legend, Monumental documents the life of this outdoorsman, filmmaker and environmental crusader, whose fiery dedication and activism not only saved the Grand Canyon (among other accomplishments) but also transformed the Sierra Club into a powerful national political force, giving birth to the modern environmental movement. Seen through Brower's own eyes - he was an accomplished filmmaker, and his stunning footage is included here-- a 1956 raft trip down Glen Canyon, before its damming, evokes the awful sadness of losing public land we've failed to protect. And in period footage of Brower's early rock-climbs (done in sneakers, with hemp ropes) and of his training in the 10th Mountain Division (who defeated the Nazis in the high Alps).","popularity":0.6199,"poster_path":"/6U8VHw9JH1qNauHfMHTckruTxIh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loteria Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of how a 1930s rock climber became the greatest conservationist of the 20th Century","title":"Monumental: David Brower's Fight for Wild America","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2023631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Brower","original_name":"David Brower","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/oPrjhbOVfnXdWHYArN3ufSUOk4D.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6667c295acabb887c0ddccab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie E.
