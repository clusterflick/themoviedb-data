Through I AM, we join an eclectic cast as they try to untangle themselves from the web of sin. All along the way, they are each joined by a mysterious companion -- ever present with a loving guidance without judgment for their actions. The more they attempt to fix their lives, the deeper they sink into chaos, pain, and loss. In addition, we discover that sin is a matrix connecting even the most remote of strangers to one another. It is at this breaking point when we see the presence of this companion was no accident. He was the ever-loving constant who refused to abandon His people -- even when they abandoned Him.","popularity":0.4492,"poster_path":"/5ZQfG2h9Bz3JsNPHWqslmbZ8mdB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It Pays To Remember","title":"I Am","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"I am John Ward","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"I am (2010)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2388831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larsen Thompson","original_name":"Larsen Thompson","popularity":0.4416,"profile_path":"/xZCPujHOieKHgKBSgPxtL8RvQUQ.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Daughter","credit_id":"5d5734984bc38b35032702ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Boykin","original_name":"Tomas Boykin","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/rUDTvhMmGkG5MjNcK4ubbUpwdqq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"I Am","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d80f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Hindle","original_name":"Jay Hindle","popularity":0.1793,"profile_path":"/kjuiNLA6acrOZtYd3CRNMQ6bNfc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lance Vita","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d80fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ward","original_name":"John Ward","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/wbBR0iHXvmpMlxwHdGIVp1EJIVT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aaron Rossdale","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d8101","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Zeile","original_name":"Todd Zeile","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Trevor Evans","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d8105","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Hajek","original_name":"Stefan Hajek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jake Russell","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d8109","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":125913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Fisk","original_name":"Greg Fisk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Ortus","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d810d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christinna Chauncey","original_name":"Christinna Chauncey","popularity":0.1518,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Angelica Vita","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d8111","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Edward","original_name":"Gary Edward","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Selani","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d8115","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Holland Pennell","original_name":"Amy Holland Pennell","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/xy7PnNHnfUg8QHlXIOL3xYf9AyU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Amy Holland","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d8119","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":125917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura McHenry","original_name":"Laura McHenry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"52fe45bec3a36847f80d811d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josie Gammell","original_name":"Josie Gammell","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/lfsuus6sAycrUeFAkIshRI3G1se.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lt.
