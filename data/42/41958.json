It is a fictionalization of the summer that Lord Byron and the Shelleys, together with Lord Byron's ex-lover Claire Clairmont and his Doctor John Polidori, spent in the isolated Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva. It is there they devise a contest to adduce the best horror story to kill the dullness of summer. It is also there that one of the world's most famous books was given life—Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.","popularity":1.2549,"poster_path":"/rtESNbKHSVqiNyYeugvMYWvbKe6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1444,"logo_path":"/1848gsFuV3EGewKg8xWADAyJUVy.png","name":"The Cannon Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golan-Globus Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four lovers explore the heights of passion.
