The film also explores her later activities after Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945 and her disgrace for being so associated with it which includes her amazingly active life over the age of 90.","popularity":0.727,"poster_path":"/pZnBH4ZJnHcVFgeuK81w2tcHvRD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nomad
