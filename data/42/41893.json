Philippe is struggling to sell a film he made five years ago to foreign distributors. Nearly broke, and on the verge of eviction, he seeks spiritual help from Master Atchoum, a Buddhist Guru. Master Atchoum pushes him into practicing Buddhism and convinces him to buy an expensive metal sculpture of Buddha. Empowered by the support of his new-found \"religion,\" Philippe starts turning things around. Through a series of serendipitous events...and some very unorthodox maneuvering, he becomes a success. But, he soon discovers that all is not what it appears to be.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's all a state of mind","title":"Hollywood Buddha","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112746,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Caland","original_name":"Philippe Caland","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"662fca68f6fd1801222359d6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112746,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Caland","original_name":"Philippe Caland","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fca71a199a6012572fba1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0365411","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
