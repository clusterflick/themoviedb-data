She teaches reading and writing in the shanty towns and lives with her mother in an old and run-down residence. One morning, Maria is carried off, in front of her mother, by a military squad dressed in civilian clothes. The young woman is taken to the Olimpo garage, one of the numerous torture chambers which haunt Buenos Aires to the general indifference of the population. In order to make Maria talk, Tigre, the head of the centre, gives her to one of his best men, Felix.","popularity":1.0164,"poster_path":"/nm0GuXuM5zpsW9Hwv7kR1cXgXD6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Classic
