No explanation is provided for the source of the plague, nor is it explained how the original victims were infected, since by the time the narrative begins the infection spreads by bite. Nevertheless, the action starts 80 years after the initial outbreak. The western United States has devolved into a disconnected series of ghost towns overrun by zombies, and the government is awarding bounties in exchange for the pinkies of the undead.","popularity":0.2374,"poster_path":"/wOPYERL00fiCNfxkbs1Nb0UzpAZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In this town, dead ain't enough","title":"The Quick and the Undead","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clint Glenn Hummel","original_name":"Clint Glenn Hummel","popularity":0.2059,"profile_path":"/jgfqoBbCPCGFpXOGoBzXXhJ5Nlm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ryn Baskin (as Clint Glenn)","credit_id":"52fe45c4c3a36847f80d9643","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toar Campbell","original_name":"Toar Campbell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Toar Zombie","credit_id":"568a53819251414ecb01bdc9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dion Day","original_name":"Dion Day","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jackson","credit_id":"568a538dc3a3684bcc02c64c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gerald Nott","original_name":"Gerald Nott","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45c4c3a36847f80d963f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gerald Nott","original_name":"Gerald Nott","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568a5412c3a36828f502129c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0495747","wikidata_id":"Q7759082","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wOPYERL00fiCNfxkbs1Nb0UzpAZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1085,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/feYqz6PceIhjeIPLYtZXNh4kdCD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":756},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/sLrD2KOLYsf81Mu4M4UdYopL6ER.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Quick and the Undead - Official Trailer","key":"6elXj1PP7QU","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-07-12T22:33:15.000Z","id":"5f1f228eeb79c20036f60687"}]}}}
