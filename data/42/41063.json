The film was created in a tense political climate at a time when talking about the 1950s and the 1956 Revolution was still taboo. Although it was financed and allowed to be made by the communist authorities, it was subsequently banned from release. As a result of its screening in foreign countries, the communist authorities eventually relented and allowed it to be released in Hungary. It was screened at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section.[1] A sequel was made in 1994 named \"Megint tanú\" (English: Witness Again).","popularity":0.1505,"poster_path":"/qnGHp0AcILEt1pnXRpjLpywDw5W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mokép","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1995-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Witness Again","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Megint tanú","type":"original title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Witness Again","type":"Literal English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferenc Kállai","original_name":"Ferenc Kállai","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/yQscSXUAj6Z8It2NTTc7DqbAlff.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pelikán József","credit_id":"52fe45b3c3a36847f80d5a77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"György Cserhalmi","original_name":"György Cserhalmi","popularity":0.2501,"profile_path":"/lI2Wqx1yIXEpmRlJ8JUw5D49ibg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Szipák Béla","credit_id":"52fe45b3c3a36847f80d5a7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Géza Kaszás","original_name":"Géza Kaszás","popularity":0.069,"profile_path":"/6qTKbniwt9e9k7Ip9gsoIXy9NIu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"fényképész","credit_id":"6475062096386400a8e63c6e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4007892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivér Csendes","original_name":"Olivér Csendes","popularity":0.1799,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66131b0d5437f501647d160d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sándor Fábry","original_name":"Sándor Fábry","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/rwTs48vu8vpFUWWtHnmsU42GVf8.jpg","credit_id":"52fe45b3c3a36847f80d5a73","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":125158,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Péter Bacsó","original_name":"Péter Bacsó","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45b3c3a36847f80d5a67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":125158,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Péter Bacsó","original_name":"Péter Bacsó","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45b3c3a36847f80d5a6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110484","wikidata_id":"Q1175465","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qnGHp0AcILEt1pnXRpjLpywDw5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
