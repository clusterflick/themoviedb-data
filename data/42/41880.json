In captivity, the youths are in the king’s service and outperform all their rivals— pleasing the king and frustrating their enemies. When Darius, the new king, makes Daniel his first president, Daniel’s enemies plan a trap to have him killed. When Daniel survives being thrown in the lions’ den, he proves that God still rules over the affairs of men.","popularity":0.6477,"poster_path":"/vDzSYyuqPBvSwRZOlsm4ITDXe5D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4107,"logo_path":"/nV1eu9bqF38PufXbth8BrVltXWR.png","name":"NEST Family Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rich Animation Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":140873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animated Bible Stories","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daniel","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Animated Stories from the Bible - Daniel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Best","original_name":"Jonathan Best","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/mtgfCst7Ox0sbwjI7sDbGPpNgbl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Young Daniel (voice)","credit_id":"641f67fbc2f44b00bf00c25b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"U.
