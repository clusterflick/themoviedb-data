It is a movie about 6 lifetime friends who are all hitting the big `3-0' together during the same year. Each one looks inside themselves to see where has my life gone and what am I going to do with my future. Actually, what I saw was a black Seinfeld comedy. Tracy Morgan, who is one of the main characters, is a struggling comedian just like Jerry Seinfeld. He gives his opinion of what women want in a man in one of his comedy routines. Melissa De Sousa is looking for a man before time runs out. She is just like Elaine in Seinfeld. I don't remember the big problem with turning thirty, however, all the characters in this movie can show you what they are, such as not having fame, riches, a husband, a thin body, and staying young. Their life stories are probably repeated many times around the world.","popularity":2.0213,"poster_path":"/sHOUR1DI7vbT6nmDrCFwphZX1hL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oasis Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Years to Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Alexander","original_name":"Erika Alexander","popularity":1.1864,"profile_path":"/8o9KbXYoRi9v1u94nbjrslOzE0n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45dac3a36847f80de48d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":75696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa De Sousa","original_name":"Melissa De Sousa","popularity":0.3929,"profile_path":"/jheJMUyabZBFfcoeRCWm8XDrj0r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45dac3a36847f80de491","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Morgan","original_name":"Tracy Morgan","popularity":1.0751,"profile_path":"/ec0OJVbs6NZKMbS1yiCAJKjeoJf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45dac3a36847f80de495","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Jai Parker","original_name":"Paula Jai Parker","popularity":0.5938,"profile_path":"/rhVirscmHtZvI3v7ZMD1TdJfDcE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Stephanie","credit_id":"5d1a4f6dd7a70a6198ab18c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Payne","original_name":"Allen Payne","popularity":0.8319,"profile_path":"/fGma6p1NUrb3hYYls4zxneNcyAa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Malik","credit_id":"5d1a4f7fd7a70a6198ab18db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":521717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.E.
