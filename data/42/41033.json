Leo was framed by a group of former business associates, and he also suspects that one of them killed his wife. He has invited the group to his island, tempting them by hinting about a hidden fortune, and he has installed a number of traps and secret passages in his home. He is aided in his efforts by a former cell-mate who holds a grudge against the same persons. When everyone arrives, the atmosphere of mutual suspicion and the thick fog that covers the island promise a tense and hazardous weekend for everyone.","popularity":1.3274,"poster_path":"/gMvognU7wny0XO4jEQNg7cY6P0s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":"/4MT9eqAB0bHzhaFVVniMaxlJ5xS.png","name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"STARTLING...The Amazing Tale Of A Fog Swept Place Of Terror!","title":"Fog Island","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Zucco","original_name":"George Zucco","popularity":0.2745,"profile_path":"/3FLDYrmjqXPAt1gq7z6ZfbBa38Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Leo Grainger","credit_id":"52fe45b1c3a36847f80d540d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Atwill","original_name":"Lionel Atwill","popularity":0.4311,"profile_path":"/2KFwXY3fsMWWyeTFxeU9GNnAIMc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alec Ritchfield","credit_id":"52fe45b1c3a36847f80d5411","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Cowan","original_name":"Jerome Cowan","popularity":0.402,"profile_path":"/79be685su9LMAr41HMVKby0FsTg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Kavanaugh","credit_id":"52fe45b1c3a36847f80d541b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veda Ann Borg","original_name":"Veda Ann Borg","popularity":0.3004,"profile_path":"/lrTa0ymMWDWQVBckPkrAjTaFJPS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sylvia Jordan","credit_id":"52fe45b1c3a36847f80d5423","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Douglas","original_name":"Sharon Douglas","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/aLMrHR3XhBjGBvy3MQBeDtLdY0e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gail","credit_id":"52fe45b1c3a36847f80d541f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Whitney","original_name":"John Whitney","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/jUnqW73trClfQtMxTJS3JOVzWkm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jeff Kingsley","credit_id":"56fe7cebc3a36821ae0029cb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline deWit","original_name":"Jacqueline deWit","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/yfuNBru8DCX7h92E7BDnt97eEqP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Emiline Bronson (as Jacqueline DeWit)","credit_id":"56fe7cf7c3a36821a000268f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Keith","original_name":"Ian Keith","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/naYkm9Y17y0CYjW26ZoH8tEcLSG.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Dr. Lake","credit_id":"56fe7d039251412a5000276a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Lloyd","original_name":"George Lloyd","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/8p5UR9ltSSadwBdxOOSrVpbFvJD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Allerton, Butler","credit_id":"56a7d74ac3a36828b8001dbe","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry O.
