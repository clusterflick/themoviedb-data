Each year cowboys from across the Kimberley load up their saddles, chaps and wranglers and go rough-riding.

Come rodeo time they are chasing the dream, gripped by the rodeo fever of the wild north west.","popularity":0.3928,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78833,"logo_path":"/enmW7qGstu4N4UCdXKA093NCPSV.png","name":"Rebel
