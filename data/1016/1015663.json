But between lost luggage, missing horses, and some amorous antics, nothing will happen as planned.  Il viaggio a Reims was Rossini’s last Italian opera and the first he wrote in France for its Paris premiere in 1825 as part of the festivities for the coronation of Charles X. Conceived for the greatest voices of the time, the opera requires an exceptional cast: three prima donna sopranos, an alto, two tenors, and four baritones and basses have leading roles.  For Rossini Opera Festival’s Accademia in Pesaro, Il viaggio a Reims has become an annual summer showcase for the next generation of bel canto singers.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/mPQkNtYJQCYpAyqPBlNYRRysmCg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il viaggio a Reims - ROF","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariia Smirnova","original_name":"Mariia Smirnova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6303a409b39e35007a8604fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paola Leguizamón","original_name":"Paola Leguizamón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6303a40f67e0f700821daf3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aitana Sanz","original_name":"Aitana Sanz","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6303a416fb5299007a76d281","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Kokareva","original_name":"Maria Kokareva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6303a41b097c4900911100bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tianxuefei Sun","original_name":"Tianxuefei Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6303a42154508d007bb4a637","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilio Sagi","original_name":"Emilio Sagi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6303a43a097c4900911100c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Carter","original_name":"Daniel Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6303a42f67e0f700821daf4d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2070,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mPQkNtYJQCYpAyqPBlNYRRysmCg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1380}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
