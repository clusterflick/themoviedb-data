The first disappointment of the evening comes when the boys discover the space reserved for the children: an enclosed hall at the end of a garden, far from the food and the fireworks and under the surveillance of a weird grumpy man in a Minion costume. Reza and the rest of the children immediately try to escape the boring facility they were confined to, and when they decide to ruin the party at all costs they discover they are interfering with Manouchehr's plans, which are much bigger and more dangerous than theirs.","popularity":0.2044,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hell of a Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alireza Khamseh","original_name":"علیرضا خمسه","popularity":0.1551,"profile_path":"/xIGalZG9XT4VsZA9Znr6mhsseLV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63040ca796e30b0091206d80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1693042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mir Taher Mazloomi","original_name":"Mir Taher Mazloomi","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/yi97eN98T1opE1dWSipafghpzzC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63040caf54508d00832a96db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2338747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naimeh Nezamdoost","original_name":"Naimeh Nezamdoost","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/nFDaSomDSImr8GDoy4K01R7vNFw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63040cbdfb5299007a76e6da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morteza Zarabi","original_name":"Morteza Zarabi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63040cc4b39e35007f687acd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420221,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seyed Reza Khatibi","original_name":"Seyed Reza Khatibi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63040cdd839d93007e4d0d9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420221,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seyed Reza Khatibi","original_name":"Seyed Reza Khatibi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63040cea21118f007d32fd2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
