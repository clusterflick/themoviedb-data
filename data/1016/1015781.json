Civil and ethnic wars have broken out in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, three republics in the Caucasus. The post-Soviet Caucasus have turned into one large conflict zone. Two radically different people with different ideals, problems, and goals are united by the conflict zone. Gogliko, a Tbilisi street boy, and Spartak, a Sukhumi sniper, are forced to solve problems of the street and problems of the state together. For one, the goal is to get back the money he lost gambling; for the other, it is to carry out a general's absurd military mission. In spite of it all, their paths cross and their lives are changed forever.","popularity":0.2375,"poster_path":"/AeLZmVpoOWXjcXQFUtY1bQ5u7az.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106819,"logo_path":"/pOHOEVPOBTAgOtSa3iIQEWT9xfj.png","name":"Independent Film
