Marc (35) walks decidedly, accompanied by his friend Raúl (37). Despite the fact that he suffered a heart attack some time ago and is being treated with an experimental drug, Marc is worried about only one thing. In recent months he has met a woman, Lucia. After two failed attempts, he is determined to propose at 15:45. He right now he's heading to where she works. Raúl amusingly questions Marc's value.
