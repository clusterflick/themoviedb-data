Ten years ago, scientists from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences started researching the miracle sound of the bells, which is like no other instrument's. Some 150 years ago the family of Victor Limonov started casting bells - and continues to this day.  \"The Music of Sofia\" is a story about people who breathe life into a fading art, about their passion, the voices of 12 bells and whether we still hear them or not.","popularity":0.1013,"poster_path":"/ldx0RmNIDvyguOdEhX311jAu20R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smarthouse Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What is the music of Sofia - the one we all hear?","title":"The Music of Sofia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Zabova","original_name":"Maria Zabova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6304b2e5fb52990082821dad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191664,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Veselin Zografov","original_name":"Veselin Zografov","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6304b3694fd141008c4896bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673869,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgi Ivanov","original_name":"Georgi Ivanov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6304b32995acf0007e3ceb87","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596976,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kiril Prodanov","original_name":"Kiril Prodanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6304b33bfe63fa007a16bab7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673872,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zina Nacheva","original_name":"Zina Nacheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6304b355b39e35007a866468","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kameliya Petrova","original_name":"Kameliya Petrova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6304b30796e30b007a827c2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9165772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1287,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldx0RmNIDvyguOdEhX311jAu20R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"B","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bg","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Музиката на София/ The Music of Sofia (official trailer)","key":"293686156","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-06T08:31:24.000Z","id":"6304b408fe63fa007f4bef4a"}]}}}
