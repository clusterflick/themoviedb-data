Emphasis is given to the ways in which these developments have kept pace with the ever-growing demands of a nation that today virtually \"lives out of box cars.\" The picture also offers a glimpse of the operational mechanics of the country's complex railway net¬works—accenting the many applications of electricity. The striking color and the non-technical, human-interest approach combine to give this picture high general-audience appeal.","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20905,"logo_path":null,"name":"General Electric","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shining Rails","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1146715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Lyford","original_name":"Richard Lyford","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63013d109653f6007fee83eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9209030","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
