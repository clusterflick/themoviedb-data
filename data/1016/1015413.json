I discovered that the men commit suicide because of love sorrow. Their wives leave them for white men.

Is it possible that a whole people, the Cácuas Indians, do not feel anything?","popularity":0.4868,"poster_path":"/3IZBanfPkkCuul1j3FH6AIPxUn9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75812,"logo_path":"/7uSMofnZkEkGhDn9S8QcQ3ns8jd.png","name":"Grand Angle
