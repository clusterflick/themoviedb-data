Precious objects - votive offerings from the National Etruscan Museum in Villa Giulia - ornaments from churches or Roman sculptures, as well as contemporary detritus come together and evolve together in a kind of amniotic fluid. Usually inert forms have evolved into autonomous creatures: these composite beings interact, gesticulate, attract each other, react. By adopting the point of view of objects, by infusing them with a dose of desire, by giving them a semblance of soul, the artist reconsiders the border between the living and the non-living.","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":"/x33MTbdAP1y5ZJM4DpPPzYcyPzB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bassin d'attraction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3476132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Pêpe","original_name":"Jonathan Pêpe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63028c8f0816c7007b69a0f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x33MTbdAP1y5ZJM4DpPPzYcyPzB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"L'Etrange Festival","release_date":"2022-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
