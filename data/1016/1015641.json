The 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was marked with a poignant formation flypast of vintage aircraft including Spitfires, Hurricanes, a Seafire and Hispano Buchon. Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford, led the salute in the presence of representatives of 'The Few'. Vulcan XH558's final appearance at the Air Tattoo is covered in depth with on board cameras for its dramatic display and flypast with the RAF Red Arrows. Other highlights include the Kawasaki P1 from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and Messerschmitt BF 109G-4, complete with the beautiful sounding Daimler-Benz engine recorded in clear stereo.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RIAT 2015 - The Royal International Air Tattoo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
