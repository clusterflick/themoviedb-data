This is neither future nor past, but rather somewhere lost. Somewhere other. The film uses a mix of 2D and CG animation to explore what happens to a lonely figure when a mysterious anomaly appears on the fringes of the landscape. It aims to capture the strange sense of ennui, loss and anxiety that feels appropriate for our times.","popularity":0.1538,"poster_path":"/hNZque5nFPXiWNHy1aMSOztEYVs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animation
