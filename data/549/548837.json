Her two older daughters, on the other hand, are supposed to look after themselves and enjoy life. When their neighbor Kasperl finds out about this, he decides to help the poor girl. With all sorts of mischief, he ensures that the two older sisters stink to high heaven when they are invited to a ball at the prince's. But the youngest is helped even more by a good fairy who enables her to visit the castle. In order to remain unrecognized, Cinderella has to leave the dance at 12 o'clock and loses one of her shoes. The prince, meanwhile, has already fallen madly in love with the beautiful stranger and decides to send Kasperl with the shoe across the whole country. Only the one who fits the dainty thing should become his wife.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1rmbFfUQe37L7oMBGIqsLZwUcdD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinderella - Munich Marionette Theater","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elga Blumhoff","original_name":"Elga Blumhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677ad79282cce15a767502ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1rmbFfUQe37L7oMBGIqsLZwUcdD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
