Panopticons were firstly used for prisons, places where supervision and punishment are the main functions. Secret services but also different surveillance technologies are the new panopticons. They can monitor, save and store data about people to identify them, to distinguish the location and time of people’s behaviour and actions. Architecture theorist, software expert, people who are or were monitored, or the former secret service agents explain their panoptical experience. Reading again Michel Foucault´s Discipline and Punish, through experience with different kinds of supervision, in the film we are looking for the perfect application of the panoptical principle.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":117020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duracfilm","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":117021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel Illusion","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2011-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Sight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Vězení","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michail Trepashkin","original_name":"Michail Trepashkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b9f9b8ec3a36833b502484f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Martinet","original_name":"Pierre Martinet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b9f9b949251412314020937","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129745,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Viktor Tverdochlibov","original_name":"Viktor Tverdochlibov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9f9bdb0e0a2663840251f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1341099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Slováková","original_name":"Andrea Slováková","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9f9b66c3a36833a90251ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1948992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Ženíšek","original_name":"Martin Ženíšek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9f9be80e0a266384025218","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360843,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jana Vlčková","original_name":"Jana Vlčková","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9f9c060e0a26637f02554a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485013,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josef Krajbich","original_name":"Josef Krajbich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9f9c1392514123110209ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129744,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Slováková","original_name":"Andrea Slováková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9f9bbfc3a36833ab0259da","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3616966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
