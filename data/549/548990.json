For this 1988 telecast, the Met assembled a cast capable of tackling both the musical and physical challenges of this bel canto farce, seen here in a whimsical production by John Cox. From the moment he takes the stage with Figaro’s iconic aria “Largo al factotum,” Leo Nucci combines winning charm with a robust baritone. Soprano Kathleen Battle tosses off one glittering vocal display after another as the feisty Rosina, while tenor Rowell Blake makes for an ardent Count Almaviva. Ralf Weikert conducts the lively performance, which also includes the comic duo of Enzo Dara as Dr. Bartolo and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Don Basilio.","popularity":0.1472,"poster_path":"/rycNe9PIzdPccomEVGoUt89RE41.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Met - Il Barbiere di Siviglia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Nucci","original_name":"Leo Nucci","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/fre6T3D9ba2DwpOz3mxnetRr8JW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Figaro","credit_id":"5ba102870e0a26219c020493","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1140257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Battle","original_name":"Kathleen Battle","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/6v2JmMtAyAXwjAUe9k2vzGEi0ii.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rosina","credit_id":"5ba1028dc3a368710f02070d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rockwell Blake","original_name":"Rockwell Blake","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/sgFkFB2qH1xqjQ5hs5lc99bNu6W.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Count Almaviva","credit_id":"5ba102949251417f2201c7e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Dara","original_name":"Enzo Dara","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bartolo","credit_id":"5ba1029bc3a368711502095b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferruccio Furlanetto","original_name":"Ferruccio Furlanetto","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/hbElzVd6o6BjwQQW3Nop4TlbDph.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Basilio","credit_id":"5ba102a8c3a368711a01fcd1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralf Weikert","original_name":"Ralf Weikert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"66ccf1695e61f34f9f5f1db7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Large","original_name":"Brian Large","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/fwMu0qHur53enoBapRcjpKw7Ydq.jpg","credit_id":"67fc3b423015363286d91acf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralf Weikert","original_name":"Ralf Weikert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc3b9aa04f530b5c99a95f","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cesare Sterbini","original_name":"Cesare Sterbini","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/jJag7UxUIn4sUN6QdYe8iP2ABEN.jpg","credit_id":"67fc42aa765c5222f399399c","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":961075,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Patricia Zipprodt","original_name":"Patricia Zipprodt","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc42b5765c5222f39939a4","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Cox","original_name":"John Cox","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc431e7c29ae5bc3d91da7","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0255830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rycNe9PIzdPccomEVGoUt89RE41.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
