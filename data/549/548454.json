The irresistible Yuan Muzhi (director of Street Angel the following year) plays both Li Tao, a revolutionary on the run, and Liu Yuanjie, an American-Chinese teacher visiting China with his fiancée. Liu is mistaken for Li and thrown into jail; Li teams up with the fiancée (Chen Bo'er, Yuan's real life wife) to get him out of prison and into the spirit of revolution. Ying Yunwei (who started out playing female roles in Chinese opera) uses chiaroscuro lighting, highly mobile camerawork and zippy pacing to give it maximum impact, but it's Yuan who really keeps you watching.","popularity":0.0499,"poster_path":"/pJ91dl0XdZgPDHRqpnAs5LGtv7y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1936-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unchanged Heart in Life and Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Life and Death","type":"Short English Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Shengsi tongxin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muzhi Yuan","original_name":"Muzhi Yuan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/eQva11c8vkE8dXXxjQzMc5o5hdc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Li Tao / Liu Yuanjie","credit_id":"6704e6c1322d3ea8311d432f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2128499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo'er Chen","original_name":"Bo'er Chen","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/aeJhBwCvvEoLFuzJ0yfnSdBeCp8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6704e71e5f95892488c00ed7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiu Kwang-Chao","original_name":"Yiu Kwang-Chao","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/p7FUo6KCyxMjjQc53na4DU2qN8k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6704e772222ead1edac00660","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1835310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sun Jing","original_name":"孙敬","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/yn4dC5zNVCjBoDNyRj0jsQ2BeJf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6704e787322d3ea8311d43a2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2375064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ying Yin","original_name":"Ying Yin","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/rz2Gf9HuOcqUc9ZXObidnnHyO3u.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6704e799322d3ea8311d43ad","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yunwei Ying","original_name":"Yunwei Ying","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ouh788RjblVtV07fXPEGYOAtz7k.jpg","credit_id":"5b9d306392514125fd000b73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hansheng Yang","original_name":"Hansheng Yang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ieJ9X0lkQfz3uIcDwMKWGbDZsex.jpg","credit_id":"5b9d3069c3a3684412000e59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0195258","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1161,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/pJ91dl0XdZgPDHRqpnAs5LGtv7y.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":838},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/daUL8NBchzUHurmXKd8ioTYjnLN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
