It has also proved incredibly popular with the Met’s global HD audiences and has been featured in three live high-definition transmissions since 2008. The most recent, presented during the 2017–18 season, includes a cast of celebrated young artists. Soprano Sonya Yoncheva is the fragile seamstress Mimì, who instantly falls in love with the passionate poet Rodolfo, sung by tenor Michael Fabiano. Soprano Susanna Phillips and baritone Lucas Meachem trade both spars and kisses as the on-again-off-again lovers Musetta and Marcello, with bass Matthew Rose and baritone Alexey Lavrov rounding out the rambunctious gang of bohemian friends. Maestro Marco Armiliato takes the podium to lead Franco Zeffirelli’s picturesque staging.","popularity":0.8417,"poster_path":"/7pTq1gYrllIW5nxbWFWqTHLCkyR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Zeffirelli's Met Production of La bohème Still Delights","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: La Bohème","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1683797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Yoncheva","original_name":"Sonya Yoncheva","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/7KgfzEZluTl9HIQBqwHaew4WJRA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mimi","credit_id":"5ba0ff5dc3a368710f020120","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fabiano","original_name":"Michael Fabiano","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rodolfo","credit_id":"5ba0ff639251417f2401c9ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Phillips","original_name":"Susanna Phillips","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/kOzAsB7AplYc4tbEVLqYtkeOqJ5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Musetta","credit_id":"5ba0ff460e0a26219c01fdf2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Meacham","original_name":"Lucas Meacham","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marcello","credit_id":"5ba0ff55c3a3687108022870","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Rose","original_name":"Matthew Rose","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/evOx7g5SUrF4JD84HyJzo51jALY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Colline","credit_id":"5ba0ff4e0e0a26219c01fe13","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Lavrov","original_name":"Alexey Lavrov","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Schaunard","credit_id":"5bd8e722c3a3683ce300129e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":479470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Plishka","original_name":"Paul Plishka","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/1yIdDZxXR1pyDFGicAP79b47ebR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Benoît/Alcindoro","credit_id":"5bd8e6dfc3a3683cea001617","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382764,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Armiliato","original_name":"Marco Armiliato","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self -
