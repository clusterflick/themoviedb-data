Although this is his first film as a director, he has already established his own style of acting by playing the role of the main character, a young man with a lonely life and a gun in his hand. The film was selected for the Pia Film Festival in 1983 and was exhibited at the Edinburgh Film Festival, Antwerp Film Festival, and other film festivals overseas. This is the origin of Sano's hard and sad films.","popularity":0.1878,"poster_path":"/dSAqsDy2gKS1gdFCnlIEHE8KDwF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parco Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Ode to the Earthworm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mimizu no uta","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuhiro Sano","original_name":"佐野和宏","popularity":0.4643,"profile_path":"/sHpKVg3MDxiCMlMGbPSvpwGxwaL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d03e21e92514162bcc0b1d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshihiko Matsui","original_name":"松井良彦","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/1Yzd01ruTy2PYdodagvYwxQDa3f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d03e26592514163d1bb8642","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariya Satsuki","original_name":"五月真理矢","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"672e45fa6c10939a515171f3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuo Komizu","original_name":"小水一男","popularity":0.4249,"profile_path":"/8aYXtL0oJRWLLXmNngWWaMeT0m5.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"68067a6cac02d4407baad08d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuhiro Sano","original_name":"佐野和宏","popularity":0.4643,"profile_path":"/sHpKVg3MDxiCMlMGbPSvpwGxwaL.jpg","credit_id":"5b9e4baec3a368440c01aef7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuhiro Sano","original_name":"佐野和宏","popularity":0.4643,"profile_path":"/sHpKVg3MDxiCMlMGbPSvpwGxwaL.jpg","credit_id":"5d03e28c9251413f2db99d7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337886,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kiyokazu Fukushima","original_name":"Kiyokazu Fukushima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d03e85d0e0a261357cc6095","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337885,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akira Ishikawa","original_name":"Akira Ishikawa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d03e29ac3a368623026fb2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2016241","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dSAqsDy2gKS1gdFCnlIEHE8KDwF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"8㎜フィルム劇映画『ミミズのうた』4Kデジタル・リマスタリングクラウドファウンディングプロジェクト本編映像告知","key":"pvLcNiLIks0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-04T07:57:52.000Z","id":"680679ce059fbcecf6aad804"}]}}}
