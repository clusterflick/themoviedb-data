A generation where the unrealistic expectations rarely match reality. The story revolves around a young adult who is subject to the same circumstances and above all else wishes to be recognized by truly memorable achievements. Mota says he has been touched by god and is going to write a book about everything.  In the limbo between the real world and Mota’s conscience the journey begins. The narrative oscillates between action and inertia, writing and procrastinating. The book of everything assumes an identity crisis. Mota, as other of his age, is subject to social pressure of making it big. He becomes so desperate at the reality of his life that builds a parallel one. It’s a movie about the unachievable realization of the individual.","popularity":0.1039,"poster_path":"/zPcnxkisCahAx2xBOv154kmChyo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69545,"logo_path":"/h3XbQjqX2LyFu1L9cKTr0ICXSX.png","name":"Escola das Artes - Universidade Católica","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2016-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Between the real and expectations","title":"The Book of Everything","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2147492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ismael Calliano","original_name":"Ismael Calliano","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xedekVAYxYL7MTnPIZHX1kwCYSP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5bbf3004c3a3682b3401135b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nuno Granja","original_name":"Nuno Granja","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5bbf30199251413d5c00d4e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1251060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bárbara Torres","original_name":"Bárbara Ernestina Torres","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":"/oDDEC1HivHOcsPWARJjExFx2J8b.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5bbf30249251413d6000e22a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1986651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Miguel Dias","original_name":"Pedro Miguel Dias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pSFpjC6VJzrREGDej3Ksko0HQ4V.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Pedro","credit_id":"61369bcfb7abb50043e5e38f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Alves","original_name":"Joana Alves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9a3d9ec3a36827800065c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Alves","original_name":"Joana Alves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbf2fd50e0a26236600fc95","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1712984,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Bessa","original_name":"Pedro Bessa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbf30b892514179a400a42d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147490,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gil Costa","original_name":"Gil Costa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbf2fecc3a3682b34011346","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luís Porto","original_name":"Luís Porto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbf2fe09251413d5900da3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147490,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gil Costa","original_name":"Gil Costa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbf2fcd9251413d4d00e052","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zPcnxkisCahAx2xBOv154kmChyo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantasporto - Oporto International Film Festival","release_date":"2016-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
