A champion a two clubs, a match winner who could destroy an opposition side with one withering burst of football.  Long sought after by AFL clubs, Jarman would leave his home town of Adelaide and immediately make his mark as a premiership player with Hawthorn in 1991.  At the end of 1995 after 109 games with the Hawks, a club best and fairest and a dual All Australian, Jarman would return home. His career would be re-born.  The man of magic would star in two premierships with Adelaide under the maestro Malcolm Blight, add more than 100 games with the Crows and again win All Australian honours.  Few players have dazzled in an AFL career like Darren Jarman - a man who made it look so easy, who regularly stunned team-mates and foes with his effortless attacks on goal and who would leave the game in 2001 as one of Adelaide's most decorated players.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vDcgBOIgChZ6t98yeuu5UK90C1t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70895,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic of Darren Jarman","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vDcgBOIgChZ6t98yeuu5UK90C1t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1332}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
