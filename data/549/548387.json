Now for the first time he talks about his dazzling career.  The only man to have won the Margarey - Brownlow - Coleman and Farmer medal quadrella. A Premiership star with North Melbourne and the man who broke through to take Adelaide to back to back flags as coach. Along the way there was a short lived stint as playing coach of the Roos, a return to Woodville and three near misses as coach of Geelong.  A remarkable man - a remarkable career.  In WINNING, Melcolm Blight gives a rare insight into the footballer, the coach, the television analyst and the family man. This is a story of success by a man who has been a master at it.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/sogwavCAfmd7yfXMumBLjRtqGZM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winning: The Malcolm Blight Story","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Blight","original_name":"Malcolm Blight","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b9ccb28925141023c00a607","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1971,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sogwavCAfmd7yfXMumBLjRtqGZM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1314}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
