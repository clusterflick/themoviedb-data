Cup","overview":"A Century of the F.A. Cup details 100 years of the most famous football competition in the world. From its humble beginnings in 1871/1872 when only 15 clubs took part, the Cup has thrown up legendary players from the mightiest times to the killing minnows. A Century of the F.A. Cup takes you on a trip down memory lane, from the turn of the century with its black and white images; we recall the first Wembley final in 1923 with the unforgettable scene of two hundred thousand people crowding the pitch and having to be cleared by the famous white horse. The star players, the greatest teams, the giant killers, are all here in this fantastic double video.","popularity":0.0893,"poster_path":"/o1wl00v8KWUyL2cbKkaPTASWUPu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99557,"logo_path":null,"name":"ilc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Presented by Martin Tyler","title":"Century of the F.A.
