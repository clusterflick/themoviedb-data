Cojot’s journey started during World War II in Nazi-occupied France; hit a fork on the road in 1975 in Bolivia, when he faced his bitter past; reached a climax in Entebbe, Africa, a few months later, when he played a key role in one of the 20th century's most daring hostage rescue operations; and concluded back in France in the 1980s, when he again confronted Barbie — this time, in court.  Caught up in history's crosshairs, Cojot embodies the modern era’s vital dilemmas: how to lead a purposeful life and reconcile Western ideals of liberty, equality and justice with the bitter memories of WWII and the rise of global terrorism.","popularity":0.234,"poster_path":"/cwwwaoudiqfN2QeV7nzUE9KdkAK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cojot: A Second Chance Comes Only Once","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judd Nelson","original_name":"Judd Nelson","popularity":1.2519,"profile_path":"/7kRf8vE0ZjMuunh8BaD50B3EhS5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5b9fb12f925141230f023c95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1906927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Klarsfeld","original_name":"Serge Klarsfeld","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/lJlZ8uwxWVRCk8KzXuhulYvYQGP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b9fb13e925141230c022fdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2129771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Kuhlmann","original_name":"Brigitte Kuhlmann","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/nVLf13bKFtL44Qbq7FSst1EMl15.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"RZ","credit_id":"5b9fb14ac3a36833af028e2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2129772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfried Böse","original_name":"Wilfried Böse","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":"/gScozG7Tk2W3D0bnbiq7VwD8deH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"RZ","credit_id":"5b9fb157c3a36833a9027ab1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Cojot","original_name":"Michel Cojot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b9fb1700e0a26637f027e4d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2129774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yonathan Netanyahu","original_name":"Yonathan Netanyahu","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lt.
