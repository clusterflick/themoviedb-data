The Islamists forced women, on pain of death, to wear the hijab or stop working. It was the first time a feminist woman paid with her life.  Nabila wrote a letter to her sister Habiba in 1994. This documentary is her answer. In 2006 Habiba comes back to the place to restore her sister’s memory, her point of view, the day of her death and the political moment Algeria was going through at that time.","popularity":0.3368,"poster_path":"/5A4lSbCFLAmyCYiwyqAODuJi3QP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Etouchane","origin_country":""},{"id":108990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polygone Etoilé","origin_country":""},{"id":108991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Momento!","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter to My Sister","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nabila Djahnine","original_name":"Nabila Djahnine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba112f0c3a3687106024469","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malika Bouhadef","original_name":"Malika Bouhadef","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herserf","credit_id":"5ba1130a9251417f2a01f3c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Maoudj","original_name":"Danielle Maoudj","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba113190e0a26218f022254","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farida Mobarek","original_name":"Farida Mobarek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba1132cc3a368710802595c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Notara Mobarek","original_name":"Notara Mobarek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba113400e0a26218f0222af","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130339,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Habida Djahnine","original_name":"Habida Djahnine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba113cec3a368711a02222c","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Production"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1966189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leïla Habchi","original_name":"Leïla Habchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba1142a0e0a26218a022ec1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2130340,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ahmed Messad","original_name":"Ahmed Messad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba1143cc3a36871150231f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benoît Prin","original_name":"Benoît Prin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba114f30e0a26219f021db8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130351,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amina Djahnine","original_name":"Amina Djahnine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba115079251417f2701d58d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2130397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Habiba Djahnine","original_name":"Habiba Djahnine","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/e1QyK0bGB9ySrgWFXo68AHSJp16.jpg","credit_id":"5ba119f4c3a36871060255b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMNELFETZbAe6UfR2fxOBhZmXO6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5A4lSbCFLAmyCYiwyqAODuJi3QP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t76K95HZ6kc6PQ4MJKnT8RddvMX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":189126,"name":"north africa"},{"id":291558,"name":"algerian civil war (1991-2002)"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
