Performed in the style of a nineteenth-century Italian melodrama, the scenes have a recitative introduction followed by a single arioso, aria, duet or chorus.  Persephone is a three act melodrama, sung in French, by Stravinsky. It is a story of regeneration, symbolised in Sellars use of dancers from the Cambodian dance company, Amrita Performing Arts.  Peter Sellars, one of the most innovative creators on today's stage, has linked these two productions by using the same stage setting, instantly archaic yet modern, and lit by rich colours to define the journey from darkness to light.","popularity":0.3153,"poster_path":"/4BEbQ6GGPPZ7GJ3eUxsE6rCyiqo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de
