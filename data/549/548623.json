Self-described as \"normal, but little,\" Mary Ellen details her early start in show business as a performer in an all-dwarf vaudeville act, her brief appearance in 1946's THREE WISE FOOLS, her 1948 marriage to former Munchkin Parnell St. Aubin and their subsequent retirement from entertainment to run a bar (called the Midget Club) in the South Side of Chicago. Two other former Munchkins (Margaret Pellegrini and Clarence Swensen) briefly appear among the day's revelry. Also included is a postscript (shot some time after the initial film) featuring Mary Ellen briefly describing the original size of her role in THREE WISE FOOLS, which originally featured a line and an ill-fated \"flying\" effect. - Tom Fritsche","popularity":0.1334,"poster_path":"/p2ewGL24VcQq0c6us2lukJAusCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Married a Munchkin","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Beesbor","original_name":"Carla Beesbor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Dorothy Braid Contest Winner","credit_id":"5b9e689a0e0a26755701d1a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Garvey","original_name":"Amy Garvey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dorothy Braid Contest Winner","credit_id":"5b9e68a9925141260001aed6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Palazzolo","original_name":"Tom Palazzolo","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/kjuOKH6IUvMu8cBbOPiZTA3WIwa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e68bb0e0a26755901de11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1468762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Pellegrini","original_name":"Margaret Pellegrini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sleepyhead","credit_id":"5b9e68f5c3a368440601e253","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2129110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Ellen St. Aubin","original_name":"Mary Ellen St. Aubin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b9e68ff0e0a26755f01c985","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patty Swenson","original_name":"Patty Swenson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b9e69080e0a26755301c504","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Berrington","original_name":"Elizabeth Berrington","popularity":0.7157,"profile_path":"/wFz71bIKTlQoa8v1s243TIh5wUm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b9e690fc3a368440801d823","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl 'Karchy' Kosiczky","original_name":"Karl 'Karchy' Kosiczky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/plWq3vlnhM9l9ZgJ2gtJ0Wdy6Pb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e69160e0a26755d01c6e2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozma Baum Mantele","original_name":"Ozma Baum Mantele","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ozma","credit_id":"5b9e6922c3a368440301f0ce","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Maren","original_name":"Jerry Maren","popularity":0.1449,"profile_path":"/rgqSqrVkCsUpKccZ9gemgZIEiXZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e692ac3a368440801d857","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nels P.
