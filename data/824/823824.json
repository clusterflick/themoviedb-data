We are made aware of earthly transience (mono no aware) in a time when the Earth seems to stand still. Before We Collide is a short film shot on a Nishika N8000 analog lenticular camera consisting of over 800 photographs pieced together. The film does not give the impression that it is made for me, you, or anyone for that matter. It simply exists as an artefact that can be witnessed, like found footage of a ghostly apparition.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/4BDDOLsuaNcF0AsyGhX08HlYxN4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before We Collide","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2418052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paris Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Paris Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/mQ5goE1YxouoUKHc6Mymi0sh12a.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dancer 1","credit_id":"6089ee01946318007a10a71b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Mason","original_name":"Hannah Mason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dancer 2","credit_id":"6089ee192dc44e0040b05eb2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071424,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Filip Skiba","original_name":"Filip Skiba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089ede40835470078ec2770","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lex Guelas","original_name":"Lex Guelas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089edd9635e78006e6c5ca7","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Gooch","original_name":"Guy Gooch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089ed8a43250f00776acf03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregor Petrikovic","original_name":"Gregor Petrikovic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089ed9c43250f00776acf1b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregor Petrikovic","original_name":"Gregor Petrikovic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089eda1c5c1ef0077ef2765","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregor Petrikovic","original_name":"Gregor Petrikovic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089e3095b2f4700798087b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Gooch","original_name":"Guy Gooch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089ed8345765d002a225615","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071422,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ray Laurel","original_name":"Ray Laurel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089edb2a217c000403a7d5e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071425,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Felix Filip","original_name":"Felix Filip","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089edf0680be80029b3aad3","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Gooch","original_name":"Guy Gooch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089e30167e0f70029d6ac9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3xuirKZwg7ccbnQsg2OJJ79NuD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":904,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4BDDOLsuaNcF0AsyGhX08HlYxN4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":603},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b2YdM9Sv6oCkHVGKgCfMnsduERr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":186523,"name":"lockdown"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"INDIs Film Festival","release_date":"2021-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Before We Collide","key":"519546649","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-04T15:31:52.000Z","id":"60fc617d0fb398004531dc26"}]}}}
