Even his great contemporaries – such as Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler or Johannes Brahms – were delighted by this work. It is the successful combination of seemingly folkloric simplicity and the complex musical language of Wagner’s direct successor, of simple melody and artful orchestration, and of socio-critical realism and atmospheric magic that makes the music to the Brothers Grimm’s famous story so captivating. And so the Vienna State Opera's production speaks to both children and adults alike, leading through wondrous projections of a magic lantern into the middle of the fairytale storyline.","popularity":0.1967,"poster_path":"/emz6Xu2RN8NnaiWGsIoGyCjMUVf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Staatsoper","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Engelbert Humperdinck - Hänsel & Gretel","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Eröd","original_name":"Adrian Eröd","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Peter, Besenbinder","credit_id":"6086ff232da846002983d2fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Baechle","original_name":"Janina Baechle","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gertrud, Peters Weib","credit_id":"6086ff37514c4a0040a19a92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Sindram","original_name":"Daniela Sindram","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hänsel","credit_id":"6086ff4c435abd005627ac57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana Tonca","original_name":"Ileana Tonca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gretel","credit_id":"6086ffaf2c6b7b002a70161f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michaela Schuster","original_name":"Michaela Schuster","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/AAQ74kdoszyGR8ZGbRoPZo4sXa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"die Knusperhexe","credit_id":"608700392c6b7b002a70171c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3068421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annika Gerhards","original_name":"Annika Gerhards","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Sandmännchen / Taumännchen","credit_id":"60870055532acb002835b34d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2474204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adelheid Wette","original_name":"Adelheid Wette","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086ff09e9c0dc0059fe484b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Noble","original_name":"Adrian Noble","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086e231e9c0dc0059fe2189","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5448,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wilhelm Grimm","original_name":"Wilhelm Grimm","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/awKfzrm9PdJWGXW8EozymYUNz4h.jpg","credit_id":"6407136c55bc3500f79f5034","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38748,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacob Grimm","original_name":"Jacob Grimm","popularity":0.2721,"profile_path":"/4HTsSB1QyKnZJOeEFTWlMEeHaYo.jpg","credit_id":"6407135df85958007893462e","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160269,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Engelbert Humperdinck","original_name":"Engelbert Humperdinck","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640713489715ae00d8f5a7f4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7226936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/emz6Xu2RN8NnaiWGsIoGyCjMUVf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
