The fun starts to dissipate when they start finding evidence of possible criminal activity scattered throughout the trails, and the deeper they plunge into the wilderness, the more they feel like they are being watched. Things take a turn for the worse when the couple runs into a trio of intimidating strangers. Their intentions are unclear, and the couple tries everything to escape the woods before violence ensues with their new adversaries. Eventually, another source of terror reveals itself, building up to the final fight between good and evil.","popularity":0.4255,"poster_path":"/2MHjDHTne9PItf1L0VmeEFTsSs3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big N Funky Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Run from the forest.
