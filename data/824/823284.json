The director is Shunkai Mizuho, who worked on \"Hibari no Circus Sad Kobato\" starring Hibari Misora after the war. Previously, there is only a 6-minute short version in the National Film Archive, therefore, the full version is this movie is very valuable.  This is considered a masterpiece that depicts a happy family of 7 (a father, a mother, 3 sons and 2 daughters).They care about each other, and also trust each other. Father started to ask all the children \"what do you want to be in the future?\" since an early age. Boys said they want to go to college, they want to be painters, and when it comes to the girls, although they wanted to be generals, their answer was \"become a bride, a wife, and a good mother.\" Brothers and sisters get along well and occasionally fight, but they all discuss the cause, and would apologize to each other. The story was so gentle that it is hard to believe it was during the war.","popularity":0.2511,"poster_path":"/gKlne5zJFz23bgz3yQTnDBVZFOw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1943-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Sons And Two Daughters At Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reikichi Kawamura","original_name":"河村黎吉","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/mnGvc3fa1DuNQtiSaZQ6Dp1dFwN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6087af650c2710006e1edb0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuko Yoshikawa","original_name":"吉川満子","popularity":0.5144,"profile_path":"/ooi5kH8H4w7FFv5GPdITEf70vi9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6087af758ed03f003f6f23b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chishū Ryū","original_name":"笠智衆","popularity":0.7172,"profile_path":"/md0GCQUr0ktyjigmnFhRRhIE1tK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6087af81bc2cb30040deb969","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuko Mito","original_name":"Mitsuko Mito","popularity":0.2591,"profile_path":"/kCyFyOJieZ70TnYUmGQatdzET4n.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6087af8db6abc4003fa2a254","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuko Miura","original_name":"三浦光子","popularity":0.3102,"profile_path":"/v6yaM7Wv3dTtN8d9yCOYOEMTjQj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6087afb48d22fc007726024a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirō Ōsaka","original_name":"大坂志郎","popularity":0.3303,"profile_path":"/mK5nUj8Jk4LJgfd8fD7083jlVWT.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6087afd19a8a8a0028907323","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kihan Nagase","original_name":"長瀬喜伴","popularity":0.1519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6087ae8684448e007931d3c1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3069132,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshishiro Isono","original_name":"Toshishiro Isono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6087ae679a8a8a00289071ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082327,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryōsuke Saitō","original_name":"斎藤良輔","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6087ae7b2c6b7b002a713265","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shunkai Mizuho","original_name":"瑞穂春海","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614d7affc2823a002a0ff2e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vhSGVmpFOSwjzEU1rJ3dBVoU6gE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKlne5zJFz23bgz3yQTnDBVZFOw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1943-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
