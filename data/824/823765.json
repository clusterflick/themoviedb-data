Teaching young people the benefits of recycling and re-creation, she calls her project “From Trash to Treasure.” With TeReo’s work as a starting point, this short film showcases a broader spirit of reimagination among artists in Lesotho, who use creativity to respond to entrenched social problems: Filmmakers show the need to end child marriage. Musicians write songs about climate change. Farmers collect seeds to protect endangered tree species. Designers use fashion to preserve traditional Basotho culture and challenge common perceptions of Africa. Profiling a variety of these innovators, FROM TRASH TO TREASURE: turning negatives into positives encourages us to take lessons from those who rethink, reuse, and reinvent in order to promote positive change.","popularity":0.2622,"poster_path":"/vuFUWQTWaqY2cAF1ykWeFWEHmh9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cultures of Resistance Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"LS","name":"Lesotho"}],"release_date":"2020-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Turning negatives into positives","title":"From Trash to Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1006852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iara Lee","original_name":"Iara Lee","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/esbRuGWQytEbZcFwF17LauvHOkN.jpg","credit_id":"6089bebe904f6d0058842a33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13327668","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1090,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zbk1TlsyIvmapg7gMuGjTOota1X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1937}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vuFUWQTWaqY2cAF1ykWeFWEHmh9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"From Trash To Treasure: Turning Negatives Into Positives | Documentary Trailer","key":"kUR8_zeyBdg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-23T21:43:04.000Z","id":"6089be86fcec2e004081c390"}]}}}
