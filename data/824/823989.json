Will he find the love of a faithful woman to break the curse?  In Klaipeda State Music Theatre’s large-scale open-air production, Richard Wagner's opera is performed mere miles from where the first motifs of The Flying Dutchman were born in the stormy Baltic Sea. Among the colossal structures and hoists of a historic shipyard, the setting itself stirs the audience's imagination. Director Dalius Abaris’s bold vision is captured for the cameras in the light of a summer’s evening on the Lithuanian coast and benefits from the latest sound recording technology.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/aVRGZmubMOE2NyNAtmzOr6DsGu5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flying Dutchman - KSMT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Almas Švilpa","original_name":"Almas Švilpa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"608a98b966469a002b1a9432","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Janušaitė","original_name":"Sandra Janušaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"608a98c0f8aee800578c94bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tadas Girininkas","original_name":"Tadas Girininkas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"608a98c7f8aee8006d059f72","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andris Ludvigs","original_name":"Andris Ludvigs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"608a98cd67e0f70029d77377","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2524829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafailas Karpis","original_name":"Rafailas Karpis","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"608a98d538520200299b6d02","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790146,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modestas Pitrėnas","original_name":"Modestas Pitrėnas","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a98ec43250f00776badf6","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aVRGZmubMOE2NyNAtmzOr6DsGu5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
