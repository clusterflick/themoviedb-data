But because they belong to warring families, Romeo and Juliet's love may be immortal, but it is above all forbidden.  The chamber opera by the German-Baltic composer Boris Blacher, written in 1943, condenses Shakespeare’s famous tragedy to its essence: the fate of Romeo and Juliet. Scenic miniatures conjure a foggy world hostile to love. Characters occasionally materialise like ghostly apparitions, while a Brechtian chansonnier comments with humour and with harshness on the failure of the greatest love story of all.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/2oJOjI0hSkOHSKhGaRB8k9BYIRm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romeo und Julia - DOR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Simson","original_name":"Florian Simson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"608a9333258823005702e2bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jussi Myllys","original_name":"Jussi Myllys","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"608a933a67e0f70029d7703d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lavinia Dames","original_name":"Lavinia Dames","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"608a9341258823005702e2c6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarzyna Kuncio","original_name":"Katarzyna Kuncio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"608a9348a6e2d2006f29a679","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günes Gürle","original_name":"Günes Gürle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"608a934f67e0f7005846581a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrés Sulbarán","original_name":"Andrés Sulbarán","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"608a935666469a00428c2696","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Stöcker","original_name":"Christoph Stöcker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a9365680be8003f6d2c05","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Schmitt","original_name":"Manuel Schmitt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a9370680be8006eff5e43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2oJOjI0hSkOHSKhGaRB8k9BYIRm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
