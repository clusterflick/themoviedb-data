The na√Øve Ruth is so thrilled at the prospect of entering society that Richard reluctantly allows her to go, and in her new surroundings, she happily receives the attentions of several of her mother's friends. Through her own innocence, Ruth withstands their advances, but she falls victim to the dashing Jefferson Kane, who suggests that she visit him at his home. Suspicious, Sylvia follows her daughter to Jefferson's estate, where she finds Ruth struggling with the villain, and after denouncing him, Sylvia takes the girl home. Sylvia lovingly embraces Ruth, and as she is discussing the shallowness of society life, Richard and Bobby Woodward, Ruth's old sweetheart, arrive demanding Ruth's return. Eventually, however, Sylvia regains Richard's love, and Ruth is united with Bobby.","popularity":0.2365,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tinsel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitty Gordon","original_name":"Kitty Gordon","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/mCGo2WBsMipXY64hkuq32FeMjwk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Princess Sylvia Carzoni","credit_id":"6089897ce19de90029f7f77d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Ostriche","original_name":"Muriel Ostriche","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/ct7En93rzAtSSntfO9GkQqHYCZ7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ruth Carmichael","credit_id":"6089898a944a57006f24a6b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Mayo","original_name":"Frank Mayo","popularity":0.1658,"profile_path":"/mQrCpMdK3THFcD68WcRdE9vBgiH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jefferson Kane","credit_id":"608989960c27100040dc71f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Barker","original_name":"Bradley Barker","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/isDc11teACHpd30tQOcqqmc5N1j.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Richard Carmichael","credit_id":"608989a39a8a8a0028936426","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Graves","original_name":"Ralph Graves","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/vqPuHyCXOw7MFtppvOW8wa9fC53.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bobby Woodward","credit_id":"608989afcabfe400295302c9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George De Carlton","original_name":"George De Carlton","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/ouj9cOAgg5JlVp7jf3ObanR0YGl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Stephen Roche","credit_id":"608989bcda10f00079785188","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Merlo","original_name":"Tony Merlo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dickey Flemming","credit_id":"608989c955c926004177cb25","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Nau","original_name":"Marie Nau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Denise","credit_id":"608989d79a8a8a00410000d6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Dearing","original_name":"Anne Dearing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"608989e054a0980057d14785","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173748,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick J.
