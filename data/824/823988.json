She flatters, despairs and blackmails in the hope that he will not hang up the phone. / The clockmaker’s wife takes advantage of her husband’s absence to receive her lovers.  In Opera Zuid's double bill of 20th century French masterpieces, everything revolves around the female protagonists and their emotional development. The one-act operas La Voix humaine (Francis Poulenc) and L'Heure espagnole (Maurice Ravel), each lasting less than an hour, present themselves as two sides of the same coin united by the same longing for connection to another human being.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dsfB1hTKCH0zAikqtvtVGnk0EVj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Voix Humaine / L’Heure Espagnole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Talar Dekrmanjian","original_name":"Talar Dekrmanjian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"608a96519463180059c25a8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2755294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Ragon","original_name":"Gilles Ragon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"608a96589463180059c25a93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romie Estèves","original_name":"Romie Estèves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"608a965f7b7b4d0057d8b6ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wilmering","original_name":"Michael Wilmering","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"608a9665258823005702e487","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Diakoff","original_name":"Alexandre Diakoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"608a966c7b7b4d003f874629","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gijsbertsen","original_name":"Peter Gijsbertsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"608a967838520200299b6bbf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Béatrice Lachaussée","original_name":"Béatrice Lachaussée","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a9690258823002690bdf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karel Deseure","original_name":"Karel Deseure","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a968667e0f70058465a1e","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dsfB1hTKCH0zAikqtvtVGnk0EVj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
