She then begins to have dreams and flashes. The next day, Zoey realises that she is having clairvoyant premonitions of fellow student Jeanette Collier who has been abducted. Without knowing it, Zoey had bumped into Jeanette in the hall just before the abduction. Zoey is able to successfully trace the images in her mind to a phone box where Jeanette managed to escape and make the call to her before being recaptured by her abductor. However, when Zoey goes to the police with the information, detectives Mike Keegan and Frank Stepnoski have her arrested, believing that only the abductor would have such information. Zoey tries to plead with them to believe her story and save Jeanette before she is killed.","popularity":1.295,"poster_path":"/bYOk0tlaHC0QWcchwIVRyLm6sbY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A botany students life is changed when she recieves a phone call for help.","title":"Murder Scene","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Murder Scene","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Murder Seen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Eggert","original_name":"Nicole Eggert","popularity":0.8721,"profile_path":"/i9aVDfIz81Zfpapyuqog6OnhX0p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Zoey Drayden","credit_id":"62f274bc1511aa0091a0d54a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Callum Keith Rennie","original_name":"Callum Keith Rennie","popularity":0.6403,"profile_path":"/zOeA4IR4xYde2VlDsHZy2SoPZkc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Detective Keegan","credit_id":"62f274c6514c4a008291efa1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Bottoms","original_name":"Timothy Bottoms","popularity":0.658,"profile_path":"/e0SKyrvvyJFZWx3QFzI4qAkWi8E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Detective Stepnoski","credit_id":"62f274d2cee2f6007a8e2e89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Allen","original_name":"Kent Allen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/iiihYaHkTbgfcxWKOIqNTujhbav.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ivan Stark","credit_id":"62f274e51511aa007a7d044f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Sanderson","original_name":"Will Sanderson","popularity":0.273,"profile_path":"/83BaK4g9sAkXzB3CI9pfLu9llLd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Craig Masters","credit_id":"62f2753cdb72c0007fcdfc7d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Lenton-Young","original_name":"Gerald Lenton-Young","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lieutenant","credit_id":"62f27545514c4a008291efc8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Marie Pollock","original_name":"Lisa Marie Pollock","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Janette Collier","credit_id":"62f2754f880c92007f17ec0a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendy Anderson","original_name":"Wendy Anderson","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/cR6uftUWXlomnokqAlSd5Rdk3eW.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63e2d170568463007ec67a85","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1641052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Bakker","original_name":"Sharon Bakker","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"63e2d1758289a000c7601485","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1835198,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daniel Ford Beavis","original_name":"Daniel Ford Beavis","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63e2d17a00508a0084a8ee42","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1810412,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jodi Stecyk","original_name":"Jodi Stecyk","popularity":0.1816,"profile_path":"/Gvx7uP5NKNgl9wfsNK2q8Z7XYZ.jpg","credit_id":"655df875629b2c00e40ccbfb","department":"Crew","job":"Stunt Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325193,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jackie Dzuba","original_name":"Jackie Dzuba","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e2d1518289a0007c477fc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113883,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ken Krawczyk","original_name":"Ken Krawczyk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e2d15ab39e3500a8196ea8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob W.
