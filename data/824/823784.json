What happened that fateful day on Everest caused controversy and debate as he was passed by a number of other climbers heading to and returning from the summit as he was dying.  Sharp had previously summitted Cho Oyu and was noted as being a talented rock climber who seemed to acclimatize well, and was known for being in good humor around mountaineering camps. He appeared briefly in season one of the television show Everest: Beyond the Limit, which was filmed the same season as his ill-fated expedition to Everest.  Sharp had a degree from the University of Nottingham and pursued climbing as a hobby. He had worked for an engineering firm and took time off to go on adventures and climbing expeditions, but had been planning to start work as a school teacher in the autumn of 2006.  The debate continues of what was right or what was wrong.","popularity":0.1223,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everest Left for Dead - The David Sharp Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4560,"name":"mountaineer"},{"id":192779,"name":"mount everest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
