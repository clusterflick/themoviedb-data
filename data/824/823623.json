Paradoxically, the most severe ordeal in the last 20 years has brought people together, while dividing them. Loneliness became a catalyst for internal changes for the six Russian-speaking characters of the film from different countries. Distanced from the usual life, for a month they filmed video diaries and learned to interact with the world in the new conditions of strict restrictions. Everything that is shown on the screen is pure improvisation, non-stop life, sincere feelings without censorship. The truthfulness of what is happening is emphasized by one of the most innovative technological formats — screenlife.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/rVR0URgvRar5h9HYydTz1m1JkCp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170204,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At a Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Na distantsii","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3123577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Nayden","original_name":"Tatyana Nayden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"self","credit_id":"60c5f796944a5700580e27e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3123582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariya Kopylova","original_name":"Mariya Kopylova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"self","credit_id":"60c5f7bf6c0b360041579b16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3123586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polina Altshuler","original_name":"Polina Altshuler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"self","credit_id":"60c5f7e718864b00401332bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3123590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regina Shtempel","original_name":"Regina Shtempel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"self","credit_id":"60c5f8025b4fed00792042a2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2960519,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ekaterina Stroganova","original_name":"Ekaterina Stroganova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089497884448e004127808a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2358655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexey Kobylkov","original_name":"Alexey Kobylkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089493255c926002b7dc910","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3070736,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maxim Zhura","original_name":"Maxim Zhura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089494dda10f0004249e661","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2358643,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anastasiya Rytsina","original_name":"Anastasiya Rytsina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089496d2dda890041195f27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2662288,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valentina Kryshova","original_name":"Valentina Kryshova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608949572dda89002be7c995","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2358655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexey Kobylkov","original_name":"Alexey Kobylkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089493a54508d006eb007ef","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2493055,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lika Blank","original_name":"Lika Blank","popularity":0.0826,"profile_path":"/bN63326Bw7yA02nU9MmhbFNKHKs.jpg","credit_id":"6089496255c926002b7dc91f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/rVR0URgvRar5h9HYydTz1m1JkCp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"On The Edge West International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
