One way to think about the film is of a camera gathering small fragments of time from a forest that exists in larger periods of time, and stretching these moments into something more appropriate to what the trees would experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qhlPPVKo0yRnNMuVcx5gMfE69Gu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Is Something Invisible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089a10b0c2710002863eb81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089a118fcec2e002907de49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6089a125ffc9de00406f68c9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":903,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhlPPVKo0yRnNMuVcx5gMfE69Gu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":602}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
