This film was intended to make a broad reading of the direction in which the cinema grew from 1960.\" (Klaus Wyborny)","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":"/7P86iJ3Bv6jGWz7YY1k2wfwGoHE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elementary Filmhistory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","credit_id":"608977d3ffc9de0029fc5a97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7006412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7P86iJ3Bv6jGWz7YY1k2wfwGoHE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
