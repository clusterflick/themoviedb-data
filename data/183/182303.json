Lum is also too timid to propose to Geraldine, so he involves Abner in a \"rescue\" effort which nearly gets both of them killed. They try again, and this time Geraldine is impressed. Lum writes a proposal note, but Abner, by mistake, delivers it to the Widder Abernathy, who has been ready to remarry for years. This puts Lum in a peck of trouble until the sheriff appears with the Widder's long-gone and hiding husband.","popularity":0.6358,"poster_path":"/pr1QucWbdN1uTTWr4WZq3xh7Z7S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio
