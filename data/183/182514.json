Although Great Expectations has been adapted for film on two separate occasions, once by David Lean in 1946 and most recently by Mike Newell, it has never been produced for The West End or Broadway, widely believed to be too difficult to translate to stage. However, this Jo Clifford adaptation has been universally acclaimed as a triumph on its sellout tour of the UK head of its West End debut. In addition to the production, this version include red carpet arrivals from the February 7 premiere and behind the scenes footage exclusively for cinema audiences.","popularity":0.9061,"poster_path":"/9s4tFVSWOaSa23rFJ9nsaojLqOr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Expectations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Ellis","original_name":"Jack Ellis","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/eKnfDeQbeU0eI5yMD7UNaV8JoZ1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jaggers","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d205","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Ellison","original_name":"Christopher Ellison","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/zrfpZgJBN7eVA09g4AOYpx69bLT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Magwitch","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d209","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":178748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Wilcox","original_name":"Paula Wilcox","popularity":0.4139,"profile_path":"/tIdjY65tl4Kq8BaywuzfGXW7hRS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Miss Havisham","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d20d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Nivison","original_name":"Paul Nivison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Adult Pip","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d211","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Jay-Davies","original_name":"Taylor Jay-Davies","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Young Pip","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d215","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Allen","original_name":"Katie Allen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Camilla Pocket","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d219","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josh Elwell","original_name":"Josh Elwell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Joe Gargery","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d21d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":195703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gareth Glen","original_name":"Gareth Glen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bentley Drummle","credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d221","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham McLaren","original_name":"Graham McLaren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d201","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268080,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jo Clifford","original_name":"Jo Clifford","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c869251416c7511d227","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2736822","wikidata_id":"Q123616248","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mBjNNH24fUinAO2eognkwYVkbbL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2826,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/jeG1ololvTjLJNCXOSdsb8Pc8D3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9s4tFVSWOaSa23rFJ9nsaojLqOr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1055}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Great Expectations The Play - LIVE in Cinemas 7 February 2013 [OFFICIAL TRAILER]","key":"KKsPOIJCIu0","published_at":"2013-01-10T15:33:35.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec708c3a368544800a57a"}]}}}
