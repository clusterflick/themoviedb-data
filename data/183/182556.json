Aida arrives in Mexico City and is immediately introduced into the world of drugs and sex by the friends she meets. Before long, she is having visions of the ghostly \"El Humo\" (\"Smoke\") and after she meets him at a party, they both are struck by Cupid's arrow. After some back-and-forth stepping around the nature of their relationship, El Humo disappears for five days, and Aida is distraught -- she locks herself up in her dark room, smokes some weed, takes a few hallucinogenic mushrooms, and then has a vision that clears up the mystery surrounding El Humo.","popularity":0.13,"poster_path":"/1vkbaxWEqLiYJprsfITPUjDgr3D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1983-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Youth, rock, ghost, love","title":"Deveras me atrapaste","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Reina","original_name":"Lucy Reina","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aida","credit_id":"623ebf507a4ee70047af2e3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3480370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerardo de la Peña","original_name":"Gerardo de la Peña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"El Humo","credit_id":"623ebf615a9915004836e142","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3480371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenoch Ramos","original_name":"Tenoch Ramos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tenoch","credit_id":"623ebf71417aaf005ce53bdf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383921,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Annette Fradera","original_name":"Annette Fradera","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"623ebf83519bbb0047685616","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194268,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José Agustín","original_name":"José Agustín","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/uAm7kjLipcChYNqIzQjkrAyEddS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Borracho","credit_id":"623ebf980f3655005fed3818","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Brook","original_name":"Claudio Brook","popularity":0.5229,"profile_path":"/k0WhSM75jPNlflgvAd928npRfAi.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Padre de Aída","credit_id":"623ebfb37a4ee7005ca2ea83","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1099119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerardo Pardo","original_name":"Gerardo Pardo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c879251416c7511d443","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0338910","wikidata_id":"Q25999984","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vkbaxWEqLiYJprsfITPUjDgr3D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
