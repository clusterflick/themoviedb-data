A large tabby cat sits perkily in front of the hospital. An old woman comes up to him and strokes him. A tall man calls out for him. A little girl lures him with a treat. The cat is present every day, quietly looking around. It’s hard to imagine the hospital without him. He is a subject of conversation, makes people smile and offers consolation. “He’s a bit of a mascot for me,” says one woman as she lights her cigarette. “If he is there, I’m fine.” What the Cat Sees is a portrait of the patients of the hospital, who pass by this special cat every day.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What The Cat Sees","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Brand","original_name":"Kim Brand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c7f9251416c7511c4b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2124091","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
