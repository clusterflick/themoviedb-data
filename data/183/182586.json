'Caterpillar' is a cerebral drama, filmed in the historical Wynkoop House, famous for housing George Washington. The crew consists of highly esteemed artists working across a wide spectrum of disciplines. This includes special effects artist, Ben Bornstein (300, The Fighter), visual effects artist Greg Silverman (Black Swan), and editor, Corey Bayes (Haywire, Contagion, The Informant, Che). From storyline through production, Caterpillar is an ode to the creative process. This film is a must-see for anyone who has ever submitted to their imagination and felt transformed by an idea.","popularity":0.1065,"poster_path":"/asH829rrjTNamSkuTWB9heVJmAB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caterpillar","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"芋虫","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Field","original_name":"David Field","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c889251416c7511d5f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2381929","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1455,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/asH829rrjTNamSkuTWB9heVJmAB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":970},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6xLPOzP5e7ymtgvrz2xQEf3YNKY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDyBw26SEe9rFZPUHKP927tesUN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
