[...] I can’t really say it except to repeat that Bresson note, ‘that without a thing changing, everything is different.’ The film exists. The fiction is set up, and we believe in it. The justness of the agreement leads us to believe it, because everything plays equally at being a sign. That’s the arrangement of the elements. It’s an act of faith. La vallée close is just this: elements treated above all as if in a documentary that, without being changed, portray the story and reveal between them the elements of fiction. But above all seen as they are, insignificant. And then in the relations they set up, they can satisfy our desire for a story. -- Rousseau","popularity":0.1013,"poster_path":"/puik6pmIAXQC07CeyMTWDYLGY2H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enclosed Valley","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"La valle chiusa","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","original_name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rA7KgE9IrUnUK7HFaoA9cKeg5Xn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c899251416c7511d8dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Huillet","original_name":"Danièle Huillet","popularity":0.2084,"profile_path":"/cFbsXcombzamJjtdDOWDl2UzUHY.jpg","credit_id":"6642b6cc9d436235b8cb2122","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","credit_id":"6642b6c25ff2164bf56a735d","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2466716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Lambert","original_name":"Jean-Marie Lambert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6642b74699d631b83b70d402","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465431,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominique Païni","original_name":"Dominique Païni","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6642b70307c06a109695d58a","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Borker","original_name":"Pierre Borker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6642b6e5e2ef387f5235a289","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","original_name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rA7KgE9IrUnUK7HFaoA9cKeg5Xn.jpg","credit_id":"5cbffb2692514151cafc5af5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","original_name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rA7KgE9IrUnUK7HFaoA9cKeg5Xn.jpg","credit_id":"5cbffb49c3a368776c8aa5eb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0257251","wikidata_id":"Q3824718","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/koBzvfWVNRfoJUXr2dKEc4eMNbj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tbFVLN8m5sU8JEISKXM3ZjzRjjG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":683},{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":1348,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/txOj8QbQ26dkHeuCTjqnlEYU8hK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":758,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3AKp4bad9feB30go3jTfrTFp6Hq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":506},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/puik6pmIAXQC07CeyMTWDYLGY2H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vienna International Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival de Belfort","release_date":"1999-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice International Film Festival","release_date":"2001-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festa do Cinema Francês","release_date":"2000-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hanoi DocLab","release_date":"2018-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
