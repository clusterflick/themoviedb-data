It touches on social issues like suicide, drug addiction and homophobia in a tender and humerous way. The story follows Anna Meyer, a schoolgirl who wins the role of Juliet in her school's production of Romeo and Juliet. She struggles to come to terms with the deeper, darker side of her personality; mostly because she still needs to exercise the demons from a tragedy in her own life.","popularity":0.4009,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South
