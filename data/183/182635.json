Die Kinder von Golzow - Das Ende der unendlichen Geschichte","overview":"The first two parts of the 19th film are about five former pupils. Two of them already made themselves known through the \"CVs\" of 1980: Ilona, the electronics worker and later youth functionary in Frankfurt (Oder), and Winfried, the graduate engineer for electronic device construction, who was then also commander of the combat group of his company, the Gröditz (Saxony) pulp mill, and now lives temporarily unemployed in Augsburg.  In addition to Ilona and Winfried, who were politically active, the new film portrays Jürgen, Petra and Christian. Their cinematic lives are shorter, because the documentarians had long lost track of them. Now, over 50 years old, Jürgen, initially trained as a painter and upholsterer and now a transport and warehouse worker in Manschnow (Oderbruch), and Christian, an agricultural machinery fitter and now an in-house technician at the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau in Berlin, were willing to be filmed once again.","popularity":0.1055,"poster_path":"/bwT9LwOkLkyHQcCVBMlQCNOu5fK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":278,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind...
