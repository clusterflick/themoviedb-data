Over months a community builds around the illegal blockade as it develops into the Cascadia Free State and similar actions spread across the region. Years after its release, Pickaxe has become a classic document of the potential for grassroots direct action to achieve victory against the forces of both government and big business. Lovingly crafted by the participants themselves, the film expertly presents every moment, from confrontation to celebration.","popularity":0.155,"poster_path":"/oCarFCE09EDK8XODI7X3vtpJJrH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"pickAxe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Ream","original_name":"Tim Ream","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54797741c3a3685c4b001a66","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1623654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Lewis","original_name":"Tim Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7b5c08c3a3687b6700e180","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0387492","wikidata_id":"Q5185507","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tPV2yKmHZjBvYVMZVPSpA49qxd3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oCarFCE09EDK8XODI7X3vtpJJrH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dB0O4uTQbX1791O4OAAylPNSh5M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5879,"name":"anarchist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
