The Bolshoi’s sumptuous staging with its luxurious sets and costumes gives life to Perrault’s fairy tale unlike any other. This performance of Sleeping Beauty was filmed as a sort of celebration of the grand reopening of the Bolshoi Theater's Main Stage (it had been closed for several years for a refurbishment).","popularity":0.5199,"poster_path":"/2Uy1HmXeq9GgsHr5kyl7Gw19U5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bolshoi
