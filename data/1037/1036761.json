His music consoles the fatigue of many people who live in the cruel neo-liberalist world and at the same time composes his own tiring life and reality. As he consoles the world, however, Yeon chose music as his strong motive to live his life which regulates his reality. In this contradictory reality which he feels pain and also consoles, he walks into the world and reflects himself on a condition of winning. Let us listen to his music in his studio, in his one bedroom apartment and on the street. And let us picture what the victory that we need for us is, instead of convicting a victory.","popularity":0.0568,"poster_path":"/mXx9ayJTlWCHfPZyMSL2zyQNDC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phill Soong Ver 2.0 - The Song on the Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"To the bitter end Ver 2.0 Yeon, Youngseok","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"필승必勝 Ver 2.0 연영석","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Pilseung Ver 2.0 Yeonyeongseok","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3755587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeon Youngseok","original_name":"Yeon Youngseok","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6356736bd6c300007ad351ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3755588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ko Myungwon","original_name":"Ko Myungwon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63567375f8e98200817c3849","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tae Jun-seek","original_name":"Tae Jun-seek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63567346f8e98200817c3835","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6448006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mXx9ayJTlWCHfPZyMSL2zyQNDC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
