It is an investigation into how stereotypes originate from slavery and still affect the lives of black women in Quebec. These stereotypes include Jezebel (the seductress, the femme fatale); Mammie (the obese woman, the asexual mother figure) and Sapphire (the angry, ambitious and arrogant black woman). This story will be told by black women on whom stereotypes have a high impact, through interviews with fascinating experts, and through archival footage from centuries past to the present.","popularity":0.3366,"poster_path":"/onRXOjzgTirm6T1MJc1yuHmvVW1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78945,"logo_path":"/fljtcLoCIKzaIZiKefL4b3nQWn5.png","name":"K-Films
