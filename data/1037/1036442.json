Among the periods and places mentioned are the English opium trade in China, drugs in the renaissance, and in ancient Rome. Many of the addicts in Belgium come from middle-class families or better and it is implied that they turned to drugs out of a sense of alienation or because they had nothing better to do. Drug users tended to start with casual substances but quickly turn to the more seriously addictive heroin or cocaine.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/iq8B7gJqHlC1RUqg4WjxBTooERE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les territoires de la défonce","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Correa","original_name":"João Correa","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634cff9a9e4586007ea49faf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.5,"height":250,"iso_639_1":"ro","file_path":"/azvCcnbqdPxVeseAsszxCx9UxMg.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":625}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1355,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iq8B7gJqHlC1RUqg4WjxBTooERE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":903},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ielYcfaLCYuVl7zDLCVQvwiaxVy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
