Thrash Metal 2","overview":"Throughout history, the San Francisco Bay Area has long been deemed as the epicenter for Thrash Metal whereas Los Angeles has invariably been considered the stomping ground for Glam and Hair-Metal. True, San Francisco has birthed many exceptional thrash bands since the early '80s but the fact remains, Los Angeles is the rightful birthplace of three out of the \"Big 4\" thrash bands and is the breeding grounds for unconventional thrash/punk-metal bands. From legendary thrash icons Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth, to punk/metal renegades Suicidal Tendencies and combative thrash stalwarts Dark Angel and Hirax, they all generated from this pretentious, megalopolis hellhole we call Los Angeles.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/lkPAJetsZELdx1f8CzMN0XoS19m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Metal: The Rise of L.A.
