Shmuel Ash, a sensitive student who has dropped out of university because his father's finances have collapsed, takes a live-in job as a companion to an elderly, incapacitated man, Gershom Wald, who needs someone to argue with. Wald learns from Shmuel that he has stopped working on his thesis, which dealt with Jewish views on Jesus. The conversation between these two protagonists revolves around the humanity of Jesus. Shmuel tells Wald about his alternative theory on Judas Iscariot: he says he believes Judas was not a traitor at all but, in fact, the truest believer in Jesus's divinity. Furthermore, a relationship develops between Shmuel and Wald's daughter-in-law, Atalia Abravanel, a sensual and mysterious woman. Shmuel falls in love with her in what becomes a tender coming-of-age tale.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/61Nw99uuKqIhVheormQjIUApWke.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Judas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuval Livni","original_name":"Yuval Livni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"641ca54c142ef100837f8e06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Einav Markel","original_name":"Einav Markel","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"641ca55a24b33300d726206e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doron Tavory","original_name":"Doron Tavory","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"641ca563142ef100f8bf8bb0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Wolman","original_name":"דן וולמן","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f13f9a9117f00ab6875c0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228653,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amir Gedalia","original_name":"Amir Gedalia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f145226dac1010c74f32b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2773076,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shosh Wolman","original_name":"Shosh Wolman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f14946f53e10aa3bffe31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4287035,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Esther Bogorov","original_name":"Esther Bogorov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f14d53a4a120139556da3","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4287036,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tali Ben Nun","original_name":"Tali Ben Nun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f1509a9117f00ab68761d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4287036,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tali Ben Nun","original_name":"Tali Ben Nun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f1515a9117f00e191bd9c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4070292,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Shiloni","original_name":"Robert Shiloni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f15513a4a12011cf2d187","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2468436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eva Spitkovski","original_name":"Eva Spitkovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f156526dac100cab98ea7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2468436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eva Spitkovski","original_name":"Eva Spitkovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f1570f29d6600e257ae18","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583777,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amos Oz","original_name":"Amos Oz","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f16a4f29d6600ff3bc96b","department":"Writing","job":"Original Film Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Wolman","original_name":"דן וולמן","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634d45c312eb89007a4cb676","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":119299,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daniel Schneor","original_name":"Daniel Schneor","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ca58095c0af00f7087cd4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eyal Amir","original_name":"Eyal Amir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ca595d75bd62436f02589","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21638646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1120,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/61Nw99uuKqIhVheormQjIUApWke.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
