In his documentary STOP FILMING US (2020), set in the city of Goma in DRC, Dutch filmmaker Joris Postema examined the link between stereotypes and this skewed balance of power. After a screening of STOP FILMING US in Goma, the audience wondered if the film could tell a different story using the same footage. Together with producer Ganza Buroko, filmmakers Bernadette Vivuya and Kagoma Twahirwa re-edited the footage to make a version that better reflects their perspective and does justice to their own experiences.","popularity":0.1086,"poster_path":"/b0yq8Im50iMhG3TfWjy1WVfQ6Zg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stop Filming Us But Listen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3743315,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ganza Buroko","original_name":"Ganza Buroko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634c19e9e263bb009c4fb422","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4766324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kagoma Ya Twahirwa","original_name":"Kagoma Ya Twahirwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66669bf0f37d0694b2e9cce0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4766326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernadette Vivuya","original_name":"Bernadette Vivuya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66669c02914b88907ae9d28b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23933502","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b0yq8Im50iMhG3TfWjy1WVfQ6Zg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
