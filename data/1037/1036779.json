Between these two peaks, the film sinks into Old Lyon by taking the chemin des Rosaires, the ascent (in the direction of the descent) of the Chazeaux, crosses the Place Saint-Jean bordered by the cathedral of the same name (in the process of renovation), then runs along the Palace of Justice (hidden in part by a palisade due to work), The journey continues through the rue d'Algérie, the famous Place des Terreaux with its town hall and museum of fine arts, rue Puits Gaillot, the slopes of the Croix-Rousse with its multitude of steps and stairs that lead us to the Plateau. The film ends on the esplanade of Boulevard de la Croix-Rousse and the Gros Caillou of glacial origin that is climbed by children.","popularity":0.0834,"poster_path":"/j2RCqHCIrmJNvZhmWN8mpbOCGzE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Deux Lyon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"634e3bcf389da10081ce28c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"634e3bd5c175b20082de346c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"634e3bdad6dbba007aa78542","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"634e3bf39af171007d9f6f10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j2RCqHCIrmJNvZhmWN8mpbOCGzE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
