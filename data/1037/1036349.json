Rotoscoped figures are layered with stills and live video footage to create an open narrative based on events in his life that took place in 1975. He was 13 and this was a pivotal year for him in many ways. He discovered the magic of animation and was hooked. He made his first animated film with his best friend, they locked themselves away for the whole summer to complete it. 1975 was also the year that he had his first sexual experience, with said best friend. It was a time of great excitement, confusion, fear and withdrawal.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer 1975","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3743887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Brewer","original_name":"Sebastian Brewer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Performance for Live Action","credit_id":"634ca59b81a7fc007e354f88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3048925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Rigg","original_name":"Brian Rigg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Performance for Live Action","credit_id":"634ca5bd389da1007c68127e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wrik Mead","original_name":"Wrik Mead","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634ca57e389da10081cd7c57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wrik Mead","original_name":"Wrik Mead","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634ca588af58cb007a3d23f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3669964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
