The film takes us on Charlie’s powerful passage of self-discovery, from the irreverent jokester to the culturally aware poet whose powerful spoken word piece encapsulates his realizations at the close of the film. In this blend of cinema, vlog, and social media with tons of humour, Charlie uses a real mix of formats (phone streaming, news footage, fly-on-the-wall documentary style) very effectively, and doesn’t try to work in a huge narrative or have a tidy conclusion. Like many who were there and endured violence by police against their peaceful marches, Charlie is still working through trauma and mental health issues he experienced from it. In his case, this journey has left him with a greater awareness of the ongoing injustices that Indigenous people must still contend with.","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":"/t77mfNbovHhzRh7aXk2Z56YKgZ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Firecracker Bullets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Charlie","original_name":"Chad Charlie","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"66c471a80f2137fd3e96a36a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Charlie","original_name":"Chad Charlie","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c4718fd83ea05170711f84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t77mfNbovHhzRh7aXk2Z56YKgZ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
