Mare arrived in Cape Town in January 2013 and stayed with a friend Kristina White in Kraaifontein. But, for a few days she would be left alone with Johannes de Jager, the boyfriend of her friend's mother. In those few days, court records show that Mare frequently had to plead with him not to make sexual advances, and even recorded their conversations. Sadly, nobody listened to her pleas for help, with tragic consequences.","popularity":0.0955,"poster_path":"/dTz5ZvpPuffxEeQw4AVFKLkqE6S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sabido Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary about the tragic death of Charmaine Mare","title":"The Butcher of Kraaifontein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3744588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Rice","original_name":"Catherine Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634d3ca41089ba0082f062d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4404858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4DbCD7silzTbDjkQtxPFtwZQ7J.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ilL3CkC6FwrJUG6t6LbGxw6MCpo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dTz5ZvpPuffxEeQw4AVFKLkqE6S.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":305089,"name":"kraaifontein"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Butcher of Kraaifontein Trailer","key":"TQ57hgL_oGI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-02-10T13:55:33.000Z","id":"634d3e1789f7490082e1d1df"}]}}}
