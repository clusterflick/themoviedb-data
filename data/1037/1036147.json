So, they choose delusion over reality. When MK finds the opportunity to make their fantasy life an actuality, they take it - no matter how many lies they have to tell. An absurd and satirical look into a mid-life crisis waiting to happen, this film raises the question, is a fabricated reality a safe place to build a home? If so, who would you choose to build it with?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/81hxDAvY5MPJGmufdB7AHDf7okp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mannequin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132655,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lu Fine","original_name":"Lu Fine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634c1039389da10081cd5551","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26342831","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/81hxDAvY5MPJGmufdB7AHDf7okp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
