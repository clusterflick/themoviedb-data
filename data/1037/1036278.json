In the movie \"trailer,\" he hears the bizarre tale of two long-lost cinema stars stranded by plane wreck in the jungle, and realizes he shares a name with an obscure, now-extinct Amazonian moth. Intuiting that this link holds the key to his origins, Alfgar must navigate a slippery, revelatory, and almost magical realism in which his own truth is both excavated and explored.","popularity":0.5445,"poster_path":"/ya4vlpzhG6ikeG4qIACbeo74deq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trailer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3743754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saskia Olde Wolbers","original_name":"Saskia Olde Wolbers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634c5fbbd132d6007de507a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ya4vlpzhG6ikeG4qIACbeo74deq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10787,"name":"jungle"},{"id":179418,"name":"hollywood star"},{"id":220339,"name":"botany"},{"id":274951,"name":"movie theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer (excerpt)","key":"33592288","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-12-13T12:09:42.000Z","id":"64488972f2cf250536ad960b"}]}}}
