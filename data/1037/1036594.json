Andy Warhol’s ‘Screen Tests’ of the mid-1960s were reportedly a key impetus for the series of three short films that make up the trilogy. Warhol’s short film portraits of the famous and the non-famous employ a static camera that focuses unblinkingly on the face of the motionless sitter over the course of several minutes. His fascination with compressed presence is echoed in Breitz’s films, which, like the ‘Screen Tests,’ reflect on the manner in which celebrity aura is created and maintained.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soliloquy (Jack), 1987-2000","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
