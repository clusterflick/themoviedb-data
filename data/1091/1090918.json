Strongly critical of authoritarianism and the failures of the economic model that was beginning to be adopted, the report shows different aspects of the ideological and technical implementation of the military government. From the purge in universities to the precariousness of the Minimum Employment Program, from the revenge of employers in the countryside to the lamentable composition of the constitutional commission, the show is full of conversations with personalities close to the regime (Jaime Guzmán, Maximilianio Errázuriz, Manuel Valdés, Ruy Barbosa, Arturo Fontaine Aldunate, among others) which is interspersed with testimonies from residents and farmers, victims of violence and poverty.","popularity":0.2062,"poster_path":"/eHVWJuCBNhnIcOhOOefz8fJlIBZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1977-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chile: Order Work Obedience","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"تشيلي: طلب طاعة العمل","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SA","title":"تشيلي: طلب طاعة العمل","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","title":"تشيلي: طلب طاعة العمل","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","title":"تشيلي: طلب طاعة العمل","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augusto Pinochet","original_name":"Augusto Pinochet","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/9py6iOsoUjrIOipnT9WetYlayfI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f86cc52c4bdc9db05f46a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4968918,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Smadja","original_name":"Claude Smadja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f86ce41a9c9188fecc31dc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2854681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Gazut","original_name":"André Gazut","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/o3KctOwAb21dn5tTWKtlqJqZf6O.jpg","credit_id":"64fe5e93db4ed6103854ef8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4968918,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Smadja","original_name":"Claude Smadja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f85fb32c4bdc9db05f44fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2875106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s8F0Tk0hbUsod7S1I53y17E2B2W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHVWJuCBNhnIcOhOOefz8fJlIBZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6451,"name":"santiago, chile"},{"id":9137,"name":"pinochet regime"},{"id":332053,"name":"political violence"},{"id":338887,"name":"dictature"},{"id":338888,"name":"politic crimes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
