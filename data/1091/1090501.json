The film presents one aspect of our overwhelming need for tenderness from another, expressed here in homoerotic fantasy. Our intense drive to have profound and meaningful connections with others is represented – our yearning for shared vulnerability so brutal we balance on the edge of violence. Yet, despite all of our longing, we are haunted by the impermanence of these connections.","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":"/dt8V5ldnqpL2iv1C8Gi9hLEjNbf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunger","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3934651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Noon","original_name":"Chris Noon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6717e70a615cf49e3af287c3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3934651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Noon","original_name":"Chris Noon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f86ef2140fbf6a1a5f4def","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dt8V5ldnqpL2iv1C8Gi9hLEjNbf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
