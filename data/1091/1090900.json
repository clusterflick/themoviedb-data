The show opens with Robert Jordan being introduced at a charity event . He tells his hostess that he can't join her for the after party, as he is flying first to Paris, and then to Spain to rejoin the Republican forces. He has been going there sporadically, helping as a volunteer sent on commando missions to blow up important military targets (mainly bridges). In Madrid he meets General Golz of military intelligence, who sends him on his most dangerous and critical mission yet, to blow up a bridge in Guadarrama. It is a major hinge of a Republican offensive push, timed to begin in four days.","popularity":0.4171,"poster_path":"/AvtqO0TpLw9MmZCSGhEfR6aiyUt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1911780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuhi Ozora","original_name":"大空祐飛","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/9vNFrqGt8MipA2NNV7q9T8frctH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Robert Jordan","credit_id":"63f7e7e568b1ea0082f63785","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2033462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sumika Nono","original_name":"野々すみ花","popularity":0.4265,"profile_path":"/iVDHF2AkqaN699G0F5FBTU9AtwH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"63f7e81f68b1ea00dc053f0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1924413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomu Ranju","original_name":"蘭寿とむ","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/ch2AIU7rXSOBWhnnFUA1z1Lb5ZI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Agustin","credit_id":"63f7e82fd1ca2a00b27a7423","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3447298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nagina Ruumi","original_name":"凪七瑠海","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/neLeysq0ZRuxdtZZViGJtE9msWJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joaquin","credit_id":"63f7e85dd1ca2a00860042e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2409447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroki Nanami","original_name":"七海ひろき","popularity":1.015,"profile_path":"/cYv0PhYlalvEJybQGAhDv9XKlii.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lupino","credit_id":"63f7e868d1ca2a0079a10f10","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3934208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shibata Yukihiro","original_name":"柴田侑宏","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f7e8ac1f3319009ebf4395","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kimura Shinji","original_name":"Kimura Shinji","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f7e8c469c70f00dca7785d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AvtqO0TpLw9MmZCSGhEfR6aiyUt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"},{"id":290638,"name":"cosmos troupe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
