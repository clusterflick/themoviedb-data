Influenced by Saidiya Hartman’s concept of “critical fabulation” – the use of storytelling to fill the gaps left in historical records – the film advocates for a bottom-up form of historiography: centring historically marginalised voices of Irish women and critiquing the structures of power that (re)produce their dispossession.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A mother’s love for her baby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cat McClay","original_name":"Cat McClay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6eec23d745400b288acd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éiméar McClay","original_name":"Éiméar McClay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6eed769c70f0086ff3539","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
