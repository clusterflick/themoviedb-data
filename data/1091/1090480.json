Taking place in the months leading up to an international move from Canada back home to Ireland – a country they had to leave a decade prior due to severe cuts in disability services – the film focuses on her brother’s writings using eye tracking technology and her mother’s memories to explore how we shape a sense of self under the pervasive weight of unspoken assumptions and fixed definitions that get placed onto bodies. Dissecting layers of language, agency and power, the film is a subtle examination of how a human life is measured and valued.","popularity":0.3354,"poster_path":"/wTn1c7UHCKbdyt6EswDd1QCG8jO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24726,"logo_path":"/4Ou4PZ9hiEJyICZxk6FfydGIOfb.png","name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":118047,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film London Artists’ Moving Image Network","origin_country":""},{"id":56184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of Ireland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cabbage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Parnell","original_name":"June Parnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6434185f6dea3a00d4387d6e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Parnell","original_name":"David Parnell","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64341868e92d8300d59e2204","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Márie Parnell","original_name":"Holly Márie Parnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6edf63d74540086d4cbe9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Márie Parnell","original_name":"Holly Márie Parnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642361efbe6d8801263b86ed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Márie Parnell","original_name":"Holly Márie Parnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642361e6cddbbc00bec86bfd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Márie Parnell","original_name":"Holly Márie Parnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642361eb7e348300f471a8cc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Márie Parnell","original_name":"Holly Márie Parnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642361db0859b40093688fbc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Márie Parnell","original_name":"Holly Márie Parnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642361e1cddbbc0104476f1e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3983909,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jenna Whelan","original_name":"Jenna Whelan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642361f80792e100bdea5e76","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maggie Ellis","original_name":"Maggie Ellis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642362067e348300b66c40cc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kp9zlPQ1HWg19zk3a0iAX4BERKB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTn1c7UHCKbdyt6EswDd1QCG8jO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1f57acFGrHDaxzPEC31IgzSBw2c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212542,"name":"communication"},{"id":251743,"name":"accessibility"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2023 Trailer: CABBAGE","key":"vZ74CLeFf2E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-28T15:19:19.000Z","id":"6423614024f2ce00774bf84d"}]}}}
