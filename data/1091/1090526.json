Featuring strange bodybuilders, religious freakouts, the bizarro puppetry of David Liebe Hart (Tim & Eric Awesome Show!), a young Ariel Pink, Don Bolles (Germs) tinkering with far out sounds, endearing go-go dancing, Giddle Partridge, out-of-control visuals and so much more!  “The Threee Geniuses (co-created by Dan Kapelovitz, Jon Shere and Tim Wilson) was rightfully dubbed “The most intentionally psychedelic television show on cable TV.” (LA Weekly) It utilizes no pre-production, no post-production—just pure, unadulterated production. The show is conceived, written, acted, shot, sound-mixed and edited live, in “real-time,” so that in less than 30 minutes, another complete, fully realized, mind-blowing video masterpiece of Total Television Freak-Out is spontaneously generated.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ctuadItpUnSpDTPFYb8Njg8Hx0K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TV or Not TV: The Public Access Archives of The Threee Geniuses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ctuadItpUnSpDTPFYb8Njg8Hx0K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
