At the centre of the confusing tragicomedy, very loosely based upon the life of Xerxes I of Persia, is a powerful and lovesick royal eccentric, King Xerxes. Rising opera star Gaëlle Arquez in the title role of Xerxes ‘scintillates with her nimble, luminous mezzo-soprano’, singing ‘irresistibly beautiful, impassioned, furious – but never mean’ (Frankfurter Rundschau). Frankfurt’s excellent Opera and Museum Orchester contributes ‘all sorts of refinements’ to this ‘musical smash hit’ (Deutschlandfunk) and ‘In Frankfurt Tilman Köhler ensures a three-hour short abundant and furious banquett … a great evening of opera’ (Deutschlandfunk).","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/byGYvDPS7DmuKMZowznI55xCMI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135239,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Xerxes (Serse)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Alder","original_name":"Louise Alder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Atalanta","credit_id":"63f6d6de46f354007cf93ee8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaëlle Arquez","original_name":"Gaëlle Arquez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Xerxes","credit_id":"63f6d6f63d745400961dca2e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2205447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanja Ariane Baumgartner","original_name":"Tanja Ariane Baumgartner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Amastre","credit_id":"63f6d70a1f331900843aeebe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Cedel","original_name":"Brandon Cedel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Ariodate","credit_id":"63f6d7203d745400961dca52","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3844122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Faulkner","original_name":"Thomas Faulkner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Elviro","credit_id":"63f6d76268b1ea009eff3aef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Sutphen","original_name":"Elizabeth Sutphen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Romilda","credit_id":"63f6d7743d7454007c0088d7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Zazzo","original_name":"Lawrence Zazzo","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Arsamene","credit_id":"63f6d7891f331900ce371565","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiziano Mancini","original_name":"Tiziano Mancini","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/kfowQbHkoA32VPcuqxVNacnVncc.jpg","credit_id":"63f6d6201f33190096ca3b68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383779,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Constantinos Carydis","original_name":"Constantinos Carydis","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6d63568b1ea00bd2d1ee2","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tilmann Köhler","original_name":"Tilmann Köhler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6d645d1ca2a0079a0af61","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","original_name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/7vbMm0VcHE0vTlaU9BTLqILenM0.jpg","credit_id":"63f6d65b1f3319009ebedcef","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396930,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicolò Minato","original_name":"Nicolò Minato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6d69068b1ea009eff3a85","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3934565,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Cavalli","original_name":"Francesco Cavalli","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6d6b81f331900ce3714f7","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21229288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/byGYvDPS7DmuKMZowznI55xCMI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
