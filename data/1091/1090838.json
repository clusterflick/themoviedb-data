Two of them attend the industrial high school in the San Joaquín commune, where they have already begun their training as a textile technician. They both have dreams, they want to study, work, start a family and improve themselves. On the other hand, at the exclusive Saint George school, two students study in privileged conditions. They want to be professionals and develop through the arts. This is the portrait of two worlds located less than 20 kilometers apart and that can only be together in the audiovisual montage. It is the manifestation of the coincidences and contradictions that exist between the realities and the discourses of four young Chilean students in a fundamental stage for their future.","popularity":0.6414,"poster_path":"/6y4io1u4v5MRKIVreKWIjT6MAYT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panchito Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La península de los volcanes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935874,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sebastián Brahm","original_name":"Sebastián Brahm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f810893d745400961e47e8","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastián Moreno","original_name":"Sebastián Moreno","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f8109b68b1ea00dc055b88","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935873,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastián Brahm","original_name":"Sebastián Brahm","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f81068d1ca2a00b27a9047","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563662,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Boris Herrera","original_name":"Boris Herrera","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f810a669c70f00dca79476","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Hervé","original_name":"Francisco Hervé","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/wogdZYj1hAug2gF1TFNdRFFzXlz.jpg","credit_id":"63f810523d7454007c00ff7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Hervé","original_name":"Francisco Hervé","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/wogdZYj1hAug2gF1TFNdRFFzXlz.jpg","credit_id":"63f8107d1f3319008c5051de","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2010138,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillermo Cifuentes","original_name":"Guillermo Cifuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f810b568b1ea0079cc2792","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0791137","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6y4io1u4v5MRKIVreKWIjT6MAYT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":6460,"name":"chile"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":226035,"name":"economic inequality"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer \"La Península de los Volcanes\", documental de Francisco Hervé.","key":"jvakb8xBsMU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-07-02T19:25:12.000Z","id":"63f811d546f354008fc90071"}]}}}
