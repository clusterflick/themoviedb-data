A study and an improvisational description of the â€œforwardness (of time).\" Initially, it suggests a form of development and passage, but the presence of sound, the glass, and its reflections denote a physical separation in the space, alluding to a \"preservation\" akin to that of a laboratory or an aquarium.  Rather than limiting itself to a binary opposition, the work attempts to discuss a perplexity that exists between what can be controlled and what cannot.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/vUFELB0pEQQt5NRKIvPJpsvb7B5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time is for what is going to disappear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhuang Leng","original_name":"Zhuang Leng","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f5afb48c22c0008c506e2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vUFELB0pEQQt5NRKIvPJpsvb7B5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
