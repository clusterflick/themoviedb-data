She was a poor Irish immigrant who survived famine and war, fire and plague. Unable to save her husband or their four small children, she dedicated her life to saving working families everywhere. The robber barons called her “the most dangerous woman in America,” but workers called her “Mother Jones.”  Upton Sinclair said of her, “she had force, she had wit, she had the fire of indignation; she was the walking wrath of god.” Mother Jones said of herself “I’m not a humanitarian, I’m a hellraiser.” Most famously, she told her followers to, “pray for the Dead and fight like hell for the living.” She educated, agitated, and organized the dispossessed and showed America what it could be.","popularity":0.2251,"poster_path":"/lU584GwALQSmd3x0Fp9CHOyXkgs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fight Like Hell: The Testimony of Mother Jones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaiulani Lee","original_name":"Kaiulani Lee","popularity":0.1463,"profile_path":"/2p5oKf4iBZdDmwSk5oXUvj6Jbty.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mother Jones","credit_id":"63f54ecc25b95500dd93b5cd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"63f54e80992fe60085e48948","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lU584GwALQSmd3x0Fp9CHOyXkgs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Washington DC International Cinema Festival","release_date":"2023-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fight Like Hell: The Testimony of Mother Jones TEASER","key":"769989557","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-11T18:31:45.000Z","id":"6480acd464765401433342bc"}]}}}
