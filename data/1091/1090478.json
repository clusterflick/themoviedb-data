His associative universe of sounds and signifiers imagines a present moment suspended between traces of the mythic past and spectres of uncertain futures. Harnessing the live, organic qualities of super 16mm, the film builds a singular, dissonant energy that stalks the outer boundaries of science fiction, horror, and nature documentary.","popularity":0.0709,"poster_path":"/1a9jc8IgR3taEfr1UrysHHas15D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FEARDEATHLOVEDEATH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Basim Magdy","original_name":"Basim Magdy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f6eb193d745400961dd3e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1612,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1a9jc8IgR3taEfr1UrysHHas15D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1075}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
