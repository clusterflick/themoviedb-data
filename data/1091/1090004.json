For years, the community around Vardy Valley in northeastern Tennessee suffered discrimination and marginalization because of their mixed-race heritage; many left the steep ridges vowing never to return. But in the past several years, Melungeon pride has surged, and the valley is calling many of its children home to to reclaim their roots and explore their murky past: are Melungeons somehow descended from shipwrecked Portuguese sailors, or the lost colony of Roanoke? This short film chronicles a community's attempts to tell a story that some would rather leave untold.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/nRzRHfit4Cm3uYksCzo3bDb0RaT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wicked Delicate Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Melungeons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"63f549567dfda60081495da2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5281260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nRzRHfit4Cm3uYksCzo3bDb0RaT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
