The clowns are allowed to leave prison to sing for people outside. As they perform their pieces, however, the country sinks into rebellion, the prison is attacked and looted, and the people chase the clowns away. Latest from the Da-Da-R was the first film made by an artistic production group that had fought for independence within the structures of the state-owned DEFA film studio for years. \"Da-Da-R\" is a wordplay on the irreverent Dada art movement of the 1920s and the German acronym for East Germany- the
