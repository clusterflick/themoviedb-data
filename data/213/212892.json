Twenty-three years later, in an effort to help break the cycle of violence, Yulie considers writing a letter in support of Mihyi's parole, thus thrusting herself into the turbulent world of Middle East politics. Winner of a Special Jury Prize at the Jerusalem International Film Festival, and nominated for the Silver Wolf award at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival, My Terrorist asks hard questions about the meaning of forgiveness and hate, the inevitability of violence and, just possibly, about the chance of reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/nFDmcDoep8sggjh6A6D9OZrrK6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Terrorist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yulie Cohen","original_name":"Yulie Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f96d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0360816","wikidata_id":"Q52837234","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nFDmcDoep8sggjh6A6D9OZrrK6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
