The story was the basis for the film Dog Day Afternoon. The Dog captures John, who shares his story for the first time in his own unique, offensive, hilarious and heartbreaking way.  We gain a historic perspective on New York's gay liberation movement, in which Wojtowicz played an active role. In later footage, he remains a subversive force, backed by the unconditional love of his mother Terry, whose wit and charm infuse the film. How and why the bank robbery took place is recounted in gripping detail by Wojtowicz and various eyewitnesses.","popularity":0.207,"poster_path":"/sgaFoabatyHxumdzTKSw6AAKdmQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unleashed
