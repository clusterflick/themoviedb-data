On March 30th, 2002, Lisa decided to document her life. She filmed at a mysterious spiritual retreat deep in the jungles of Honduras, but 26 days later, after a tragic accident, she was dead and her unedited tapes were left behind. Last Days of Left Eye is the re-imagining of the film Lisa never got to complete. Revealing private moments from Lisa's journals and home movies, along with highlights from her celebrated career, this film is an intimate journey into the soul of a talented and still provocative young artist. Directed by Lauren Lazin, Academy Award nominated director of Tupac: Resurrection (2005, Best Documentary Feature), Last Days of Left Eye has screened to sold-out audiences at film festivals around the world.","popularity":1.0247,"poster_path":"/tNx2xyMZZmaAgwyEqhcV9jN6bb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10692,"logo_path":"/qFS7NEIS3fiBW1wi6VMAcwAsFCX.png","name":"VH1","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Days of Left Eye","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1098122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes","original_name":"Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/nsM8MMJeRSmRstvk8or9kPQR6va.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4dacc3a368484e1f63bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tionne 'T-Boz' Watkins","original_name":"Tionne 'T-Boz' Watkins","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/oCNaIoJE6qZY71W2a5TqlNiYqXu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e7c249cd2046001b5e19dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":391533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rozonda 'Chilli' Thomas","original_name":"Rozonda 'Chilli' Thomas","popularity":0.2656,"profile_path":"/v6t7BGtJsmjOuoDjMHu3Ar0t3BC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e7c26b72a2c900c7c7538d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Lazin","original_name":"Lauren Lazin","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dacc3a368484e1f63bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Lazin","original_name":"Lauren Lazin","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dacc3a368484e1f63c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045232,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Beinstein","original_name":"David Beinstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dacc3a368484e1f63cb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0945357","wikidata_id":"Q7745677","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/34Um7La2mZwT78GBI6XndGeGvLz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1422,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tNx2xyMZZmaAgwyEqhcV9jN6bb0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":898,"name":"hip-hop"},{"id":6007,"name":"media"},{"id":4562,"name":"rapper"},{"id":10887,"name":"home movie footage"},{"id":13063,"name":"car accident"},{"id":157296,"name":"bankruptcy"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":195162,"name":"record company"},{"id":227541,"name":"spiritual retreat"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":254624,"name":"r&b artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Left Eye Breaks It Down!!!","key":"E92q9pYnaYo","published_at":"2012-07-25T18:14:11.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec716c3a368544800aeec"}]}}}
