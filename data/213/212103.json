He goes to the edge of a cliff, where he meats an Asian spirit who gives him a heart shape that becomes a kite that hooks to him with a cane. This is followed by approximately ten minutes of kaleidoscopic images, including a man's hands, a dancing girl, and a cutout of Krishna.","popularity":0.2246,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No. 16: Oz: The Tin Woodman's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Smith","original_name":"Harry Smith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/cockMGxZmgwBhXbVMUGxpZ9gEZU.jpg","credit_id":"56c48e6a9251416bb300238d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
