Her voice and acting are stunning. Nazzareno Antinori is also a solid Pinkerton with a pleasing voice, and Eleonora Jacovic is a wonderful Suzuki. To top things off the scenery is quite well done, and the staging is effective. I can't imagine any other filmed \"Butterfly\" being better than this one.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madama Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277121","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
