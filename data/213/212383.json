After three jail sentences (under two different names), aged 70 and suffering from terminal cancer, he announced his return to music. We follow a gun-toting McGill and his fiance Joyce through four states as he steals whatever's not nailed down and charms his way into and out of trouble. But when you point a camera at a man who will do anything for notoriety, how responsible are you when he goes too far?","popularity":0.3352,"poster_path":"/cQTh0QiNRiqr7TQOxLmK68QF415.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Very Extremely Dangerous","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry McGill","original_name":"Jerry McGill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a63fd080e0a261a0401bf2a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Duane","original_name":"Paul Duane","popularity":0.1466,"profile_path":"/1ARJpI5TlOdDOaaKYJDv0UwZdRe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4daac3a368484e1f5f43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gordon","original_name":"Robert Gordon","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/ga18g92FNpOoHsPGlPgXrlZtAcd.jpg","credit_id":"5b89c960c3a3685206008cad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2142027","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cQTh0QiNRiqr7TQOxLmK68QF415.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6552,"name":"rockabilly"},{"id":3702,"name":"memphis, tennessee"},{"id":10163,"name":"cancer"},{"id":156117,"name":"illegal drugs"},{"id":179022,"name":"confession of crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Very Extremely Dangerous - promo","key":"XjnMxed4H2E","published_at":"2012-11-15T13:22:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec716c3a368544800aeeb"}]}}}
