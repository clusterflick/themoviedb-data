In Theo Taylor’s perceptive lo-fi feature we out with such a trio over a weekend spent at Lake Tarawera.  Hadley, the mate, is in the throes of a breakup. Chris has joined him at his parents’ well-appointed lakeside house, bringing along girlfriend Lucy to provide moral support. But all Hadley wants to do is party, and he’s come very well provisioned. When Lucy gets delightedly trashed on night one, the drug-averse Chris begins to have second thoughts. Hadley’s determination to (a) stay high and (b) provide water skiing lessons on the freezing lake sends Chris’ ill-concealed need for control into further convolutions.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When your mate has relationship problems, is it a good idea to bring your girlfriend along to help cheer him up?","title":"Scenes in My Head","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2815382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Baxter","original_name":"Joseph Baxter","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"634f55865f4b73008d54f2fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Haren","original_name":"Simon Haren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Hadley","credit_id":"634f5626f3b49a007a82ba15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isobel MacKinnon","original_name":"Isobel MacKinnon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"634f5640a57d43007a2dbacb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Gwyn Lewis","original_name":"Lloyd Gwyn Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Lou","credit_id":"634f566384448e0091534b74","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Taylor","original_name":"Theo Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f54ccbe4b36009c624582","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Taylor","original_name":"Theo Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f54e75f4b73007b83b3b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Taylor","original_name":"Theo Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f54fbbe4b36007c672e0b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Taylor","original_name":"Theo Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f552256b9f7007e2d49a4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747067,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Rothman","original_name":"Alex Rothman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f5534869e75008f4fb75d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Taylor","original_name":"Theo Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f554556b9f7007b11b558","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Currie","original_name":"David Currie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f55582da846007ca7c278","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
