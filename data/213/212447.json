Ten stories of ten protagonists (from 20-45 years old) who live in a metropolis, not necessarily identifiable, in search of the meaning of their own existence. A bitter comedy that combines comic and paradoxical elements with the cruelty of everyday life. A whirl of encounters, sex, illness, drugs, loneliness and pain.","popularity":0.4138,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleeping Around","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Dilettoinletto","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Galiena","original_name":"Anna Galiena","popularity":0.6936,"profile_path":"/rJKizpOOVV0ZsdFss20wNqaS2NG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f6673","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darío Grandinetti","original_name":"Darío Grandinetti","popularity":0.4388,"profile_path":"/l1Gw8OLzw7FehGeQK7pZ5wJOIgF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marcelo","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f667b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":449806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Faiella","original_name":"Francesca Faiella","popularity":0.234,"profile_path":"/uGvAnLM5RGoxAzzj47XPIeFFXUR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Beatrice","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f666b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danilo Nigrelli","original_name":"Danilo Nigrelli","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/mQEJArxQ67XJLrtYB5RKkgs4ADD.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Giovanni","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f6687","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Foschi","original_name":"Marco Foschi","popularity":0.2139,"profile_path":"/oDpkEbuOjR3MyJCeHzySRTtLvR1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Paolo","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f666f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Bocchi","original_name":"Roberto Bocchi","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/wHYrg9qEOrFjYbKuYHMBTWQBz7Z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Medico","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f6663","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorenzo De Angelis","original_name":"Lorenzo De Angelis","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/22erqLIwqgOt1zvIQDJQ67zNySn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ricky","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f6667","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Giardina","original_name":"Carmen Giardina","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":"/9iuQzaZLz5Oh2UYeRcaNsYqfLiV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lori","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f6677","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamil Hammoudi","original_name":"Jamil Hammoudi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xJDrlOKTavOpkBNFJSag9aCYG4e.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bed","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f667f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Salvati","original_name":"Carolina Salvati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sonia","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f668b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Ichikawa","original_name":"Jun Ichikawa","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/14I8xU8EbFstCKaxZ43fr7iLa6L.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Elena","credit_id":"547cd2219251412d7c0039e0","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Carniti","original_name":"Marco Carniti","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f6691","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196845,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marco Carniti","original_name":"Marco Carniti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f6697","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Giardina","original_name":"Carmen Giardina","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":"/9iuQzaZLz5Oh2UYeRcaNsYqfLiV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dadc3a368484e1f669d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1076796","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
