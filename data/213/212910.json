The film follows a police investigation into four murders and charts the doomed romance of the outlaw lovers. A deeply romantic, elegiac and universal crime story where the murders are not the point of the movie.","popularity":0.3805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Durban Poison","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Auret","original_name":"Brandon Auret","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/7MjyB6s1LGzDbcvm4dwKRi0QLzq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Piet","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f9791","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gys de Villiers","original_name":"Gys de Villiers","popularity":0.2249,"profile_path":"/saIe2KMwwssTLnoghRdYlsLv6m0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Muller","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f9795","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Keogh","original_name":"Danny Keogh","popularity":0.4349,"profile_path":"/qvvWCPcFSWe23LxUzEEnjHM1vcn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Klippie","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f9799","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":193319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Opperman","original_name":"Frank Opperman","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/rsUTPXE6REVqwa1RD274ueffxlz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Stoffel","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f979d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cara Roberts","original_name":"Cara Roberts","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Joline","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f97a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Van Heerden","original_name":"Marcel Van Heerden","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/f6s7hlWptEYZrEjA2vlZIjO4HA9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Du Plessis","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f97a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drikus Volschenk","original_name":"Drikus Volschenk","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Strijdom","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f97a9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Worsdale","original_name":"Andrew Worsdale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/SEgjsiqxSQePlVx2AHZ6nuTn6p.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f9787","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Worsdale","original_name":"Andrew Worsdale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/SEgjsiqxSQePlVx2AHZ6nuTn6p.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db9c3a368484e1f978d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3057894","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
