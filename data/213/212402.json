It is also where Roscoe Driggers hangs out. Roscoe claims to be the world's champion cornet player, although he can't play a note, even a sour one. But when the chance to earn $500 for playing his cornet at the big concert held by the \"Over the River Burying Society\" arises, Roscoe signs up. Roscoe needs $500 in order to buy a beauty shop for his manicurist-fianc√©e, Zenia Sprowl. Roscoe makes plans for his buddy Sam Ginn, who can play a cornet, to hide under the stage and play while Roscoe fakes it on the stage. But Sam gets taken out by some dudes who have a bone to pick with Roscoe. No sweat, though, as another of Roscoe's musician friends, Willie Trout, sees this and takes Sam's place under the stage....with his saxophone.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/jxX23LAGIAzTZAnPcUeAs3iySW3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Hath Harms","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Graham","original_name":"Walter Graham","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dabc3a368484e1f6147","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0363835","wikidata_id":"Q101245382","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jxX23LAGIAzTZAnPcUeAs3iySW3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
