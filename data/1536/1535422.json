That’s exactly what happens in Eenie Meanie (2025). The movie follows Edie, who once lived on the wrong side of the law but swore she’d never go back. Life was calm until someone she cares about ends up in serious trouble. Suddenly, Edie is back in a world she thought was behind her.  What makes this film so gripping is the way it keeps you guessing. Every turn brings a new challenge, and you can feel Edie’s fear and determination in every scene. Samara Weaving nails this role—she’s strong, vulnerable, and absolutely believable. If you love movies that mix action with raw emotion, this one will stick with you. It’s a story about choices, survival, and how the past never really lets go.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The past isn’t done with her yet","title":"Eenie Meanie (2025) – A Thrilling Ride Back into Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
