Over the following 8 months, the building was methodically demolished by hand. Slowly revealing the belongings and interior lives of the former residents along the way. In a series of vignettes, High Visibility captures the death of a home, the treachery of memory, and the inherent falsity of images, both analog and digital. Questioning the co-option of these flawed, transient objects into tools to justify nostalgia and atrocities.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4B6j7ZoKJm3WW3Ydp2XpDbtJmpJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High Visibility","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Callon Murphy","original_name":"Callon Murphy","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/axVEGYgdVVUYGSgVvbD1I31sdul.jpg","credit_id":"68ab928b66ce7b589c54862c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1946,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4B6j7ZoKJm3WW3Ydp2XpDbtJmpJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1298}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
