Silent Screams reimagines the Fury, a mythological figure from Greek lore, as a terrifying embodiment of guilt and fear. Blind yet relentlessly attuned to its victims, the Fury hunts by the scent of guilt and the sound of trembling conscience, forcing those who encounter it to confront their darkest truths.  As the mother struggles to protect her daughter, she must face the consequences of her own choices and the deep emotional wounds she has tried to bury. The Fury becomes more than just a monster—it is a reflection of the guilt and regret that bind and divide us, lurking in the spaces we try hardest to hide. With its atmospheric tension, Silent Screams delivers a visceral and emotionally charged horror experience, combining mythological depth with modern cinematic storytelling.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4WAov7H2VdC5cSkXMjyrefOwzms.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Screams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Ward","original_name":"Alexander Ward","popularity":1.1466,"profile_path":"/qGJGhAVeCLNWtGr7LcYKci5WQjS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Fury","credit_id":"68ac8c54da0435381d6ceefc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":565342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer L.
