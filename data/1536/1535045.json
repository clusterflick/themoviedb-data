Гималайцы","overview":"The film's hero is Sergey Kolchin, a zoologist and specialist in large predatory mammals of the Far East, who has been involved in the rehabilitation of orphaned bear cubs in various years. He returned cubs that had lost their mothers due to human error to the wild. Long months of living in the forest in the company of bear cubs allowed Sergey to learn many previously unknown facts about the Himalayan bear. The unique video material he collected formed the basis for the film \"My Bears. Himalayans\". This unusual animal lives in the mountain forests of South, Southeast and East Asia. The northernmost and largest of its seven subspecies, the Ussuri bear, lives in the south of the Russian Far East. Its build and ability to lead a semi-arboreal lifestyle help it survive in the same territory as the tiger and brown bear. The Himalayan bear is a poorly studied and vulnerable species, whose fate personifies the difficult fate of cedar-broadleaf forests.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Мои медведи.
