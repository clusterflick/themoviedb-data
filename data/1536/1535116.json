How will civilizations form? Will there be peace or war? The story that naturally unfolded was incredible.  Out of 8000+ applicants, 1300 players were accepted to play in the 1000 Player Civilization Experiment (also known as \"Season 2.5\"). Before the event began, players selected which island they wanted to join without knowing the traits of each island. Each day, all players logged on at the same time, and session lasted around 2-3 hours. For the most part, players could do whatever they want. A few limitations were set on the players to promote a better experience, like banning random killing (RDM), disabling most Minecraft enchantments, disabling unrealistic items like ender pearls, disabling other dimensions like the Nether, and a few more misc. rules.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rYlcQ6tP5VEUCdcUcOIvRQ5j7LU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"One island has everything.
