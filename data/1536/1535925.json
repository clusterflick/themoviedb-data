It was first created for the Giphy Film Fest and submitted on November 8, 2018, before being publicly released on December 4, 2018  . The video playfully reimagines the childhood tradition of placing a lost tooth under a pillow for a reward.  Synopsis in a nutshell:\r A young girl orders a small coffee priced at $1.29. Instead of paying with money, she offers her tooth. Surprisingly, the cashier accepts it. Later, the cashier places the tooth under their own pillow. The next morning, the girl’s mother checks under the pillow, and the cashier returns to the register with a coin—continuing the transaction.  Fun trivia: Take Tooth is one of the few of Stauber’s VHS–style animations that doesn’t include the “Created by Jack Stauber” note at the end—this stylistic omission was likely due to the film festival requirements.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"none officially given - it was made for the Giphy Film Fest","title":"take tooth","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
