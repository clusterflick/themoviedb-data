Sensitive LIVE","overview":"On the evening of February 12th, 2025, in a tiny venue deep in the heart of London’s West End, a very special group of people met to celebrate the launch of the album, Sensitive – An Indie Pop Anthology.  This was a group of legendary, underground musicians who had helped define a movement characterised by an independent spirit, a desire to remain outside of the mainstream and to create  romantic yet authentic music which spoke to everyday people about their everyday lives. The indie pop scene of the 1980’s was pivotal in shaping an attitude and aesthetic of do-it-yourself, the ripples of which are still felt today, over 40 years later, amongst young artists self-releasing music via digital platforms.  Sensitive Live brought together the founding fathers of the indie pop movement for an exclusive, unforgettable, one-off show featuring performances of classic songs from the era, all of which can be heard in their original form on the Sensitive album.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lOjO3RX35sri1eFeHKXFtXMO10C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sometimes I Want To Return...
