This documentary gathers the testimonies collected during a journey to the occupied territories by an international delegation headed by the mayor of Donostia/San Sebastián, Juan Karlos Izagirre. Over the course of five days they held over twenty secret meetings with human rights activists, from home to home, constantly under watch by the Moroccan police. Despite living under an occupation that has lasted for almost 40 years, the Sahrawi people maintain their identity and culture. A revolutionary act, a struggle to defend their right to exist as a people.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3xwnKEF2FNjS3GieKbBRDSe8vML.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ayuntamiento de Donostia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Messages from Western Sahara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5649504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Berasain","original_name":"Kristina Berasain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68acf131da0435381d6cf15e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":991,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/3xwnKEF2FNjS3GieKbBRDSe8vML.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":356811,"name":"occupied territories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
