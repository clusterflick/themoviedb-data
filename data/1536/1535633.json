Shingles (called \"tavillons\" in Switzerland), are one of the oldest methods of roofing or covering an outside wall. There are no longer any official apprenticeships. The film follows two shingle-makers, Joseph Doutaz and Olivier Veuve, who have very different techniques of cutting and placing their shingles. Joseph Doutaz uses only the traditional \"tavillons\" while Olivier Veuve works with these, as well as with \"anseilles,\" larger and thicker wood tiles. We see both men at work in Winter and in Summer, and see some of their finished buildings.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joseph Doutaz & Olivier Veuve, Shingle-makers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5648850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Doutaz","original_name":"Joseph Doutaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68ac9ae2913bc2bd421e595c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5648852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Veuve","original_name":"Olivier Veuve","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68ac9af185172818541e5771","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Veuve","original_name":"Jacqueline Veuve","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/2Gt2pyXRGywy5ktcpFoj9Fnmei4.jpg","credit_id":"68ac9bfaf7de7344255488f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Joseph Doutaz and Oliver Veuve, Shingle Makers - PREVIEW","key":"fOJOX_PUwjo","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-01-24T16:29:11.000Z","id":"68aca0ba61afe331861e5465"}]}}}
