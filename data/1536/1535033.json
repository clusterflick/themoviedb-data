Isolated in a world where people no longer touch each other, Noah discovers the existence of a secret “touch therapy,” which quietly helps people overcome their fear of physical contact.\r This scene not only explores the ever-increasing isolation of humans in an increasingly polarized society but also touches on the taboo surrounding sex work. The film emphasizes the essential human need for touch and physical contact in a time of growing individualism.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touchpoint","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Flo Demeyer","original_name":"Flo Demeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab29f492c1b40d406ce5c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5086606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carice van Heusden","original_name":"Carice van Heusden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab2a1ac195c49deb448dc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5086606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carice van Heusden","original_name":"Carice van Heusden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab2a35a628d42a61448bed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3750772,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Glenn Wolfs","original_name":"Glenn Wolfs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab2a5bc6eff2f62ca99fd0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646173,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lyth Lochoshvili","original_name":"Lyth Lochoshvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab2acd46a9c893ed6ce476","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598244,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paco Juchtmans","original_name":"Paco Juchtmans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab2aecdfa562a3e2548179","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
