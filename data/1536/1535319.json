At first they were confused, but then they begin to remember why they’re there after the event organizer reminds them through the speaker—it’s an eating contest with a prize of 325 million Rupiah. The two men stop questioning when they’re given 25 million Rupiah upfront.  The eating contest begins. However, as time passes, the situation grows increasingly bizarre. They start seeing things and hallucinating, preventing them from winning the competition. Regardless, they must finish the food to claim the grand prize and ensure their survival.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LAHAP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
