Co-directed by Service95's content editor Pia Brynteson and filmmaker Ramzi Hibri, the film captures the challenges and triumphs of young Lebanese creatives as they navigate their education and careers in the fashion industry - particularly in the wake of the devastating explosion in the Port of Beirut in 2020.\r ‚Äç\r The film explores the political, social, and economic crisis facing the population of Lebanon, and how the government's limited assistance to the creative industries has made it a constant struggle for CSB-SD to continue supporting their students, and pursue their goal of expanding their initiative.  The Creative Space sheds light on the ongoing turbulence in Lebanon, the power of education and the importance of supporting the next generation of creative talent.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/p2TLtYsfqBll7qlAoOtNQQSY1nb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beirut's young talent in pursuit of a future reimagined","title":"The Creative Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5648037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Brynteson","original_name":"Pia Brynteson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ac42d0eab92453cb6cea7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055025,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramzi Hibri","original_name":"Ramzi Hibri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ac42eb79e32ab66d9db612","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055025,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramzi Hibri","original_name":"Ramzi Hibri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ac42fa66ce7b589c54891e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001239,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Malek Hosni","original_name":"Malek Hosni","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ac4338c7e9a00b78782352","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2540,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p2TLtYsfqBll7qlAoOtNQQSY1nb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1814}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE CREATIVE SPACE | A Short Documentary","key":"p4yJQA7RQBM","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-28T14:58:30.000Z","id":"68ac44f5d78bc8998978204c"}]}}}
