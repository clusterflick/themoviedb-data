He trained as a carpenter and cabinet maker and owns the last water-powered sawmill still operating in French-speaking Switzerland. He and his wife have five children, two of their own, and three nephews adopted after the death of their parents in a car accident. So, to earn a living, he makes and carves cupboards and turns bannisters. In addition to his work, Pernet has become a sculptor as well. His bas-relief carvings, which have decorated local cafés, show various aspects of mountain life, including hunters, poachers, chamois and other animals.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"François Pernet, Carpenter and Sculptor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5648831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Pernet","original_name":"François Pernet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68ac98e767423aae5c6cec54","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Veuve","original_name":"Jacqueline Veuve","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/2Gt2pyXRGywy5ktcpFoj9Fnmei4.jpg","credit_id":"68ac9b70cfced3ff734490ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Francois Pernet, Carpenter and Sculptor - PREVIEW","key":"Z0ZKVTgSawE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2012-01-24T15:34:28.000Z","id":"68aca0342d2c51440e449228"}]}}}
