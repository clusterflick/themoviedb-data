Unlike other children’s Christmas lists, Caroline writes her list of heartfelt prayers to Jesus, requesting blessings for her family, friends, and community – including one to ask that her recently widowed dad will find happiness again. Touched by Caroline’s list, Natalie begins to secretly fulfill each blessing. In turn, she is inspired to create a new character, Adeline the Angel, to illustrate the ways Jesus quietly works through everyday people to answer prayers with love and grace.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":272172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christmas Blessings Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":70603,"logo_path":"/uv80BFKZtQe95CXkRIAeJt8TiLJ.png","name":"Vortex Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Christmas List of Blessings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2538604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shae Robins","original_name":"Shae Robins","popularity":0.4717,"profile_path":"/vfOLdbrzCzKQgMQNU6wMDbSAMi5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Natalie","credit_id":"68ac50209c4b8a6b8e670c31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Russell","original_name":"Christopher Russell","popularity":0.6889,"profile_path":"/hD2wchFBarE1tFYBGORwidEL7pT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wes","credit_id":"68ac502ee4116d49266ceac0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Kun","original_name":"Derek Kun","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":"/977how8emS0z7d902iFmvONSKDU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Matt","credit_id":"68ac503ca6e6b21bbc4490ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Strickland","original_name":"Michael Strickland","popularity":0.3431,"profile_path":"/iQiaj9Lhc48nbGrIpWlUNahmg1Q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Stephen","credit_id":"68ac5042bdd4f40c236cec31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Young","original_name":"Tom Young","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/7qWQmOU58E7y2bcIFRbfPKpYmgt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"68ac5063aea5faed086ced0a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3882813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Cox","original_name":"Madeleine Cox","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Caroline","credit_id":"68ac5068f263780c685484d0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2443653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenda Gorlick","original_name":"Brenda Gorlick","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/9nsylgTClZYLZG84i1MWcAfvHQr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Katy","credit_id":"68ac506eb795627c927824a5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5648182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhiann Duncan","original_name":"Rhiann Duncan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Hannah","credit_id":"68ac5075f263780c685484db","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas Humphries","original_name":"Nicholas Humphries","popularity":1.4649,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ac50ca9319c60dab548425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1694961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ansley Gordon","original_name":"Ansley Gordon","popularity":0.3446,"profile_path":"/ri0s9fvhxZ6jiQad9h2gESH7D5H.jpg","credit_id":"68ac50d0f263780c685484ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228801,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Fankhauser","original_name":"Anthony Fankhauser","popularity":0.4132,"profile_path":"/d88sL3akL6iaOkr47DbXBcpEEkF.jpg","credit_id":"68ac50fdb795627c927824ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3688013,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samantha DeGagne","original_name":"Samantha DeGagne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ac5105e15eaed8e48d25a9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5648131,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"JDH","original_name":"JDH","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ac510bce6d589e929db2a7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423734,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas P.
