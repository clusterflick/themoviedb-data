Karel Martens trained and inspired younger generations of designers in the Netherlands and internationally. The exhibition is a journey of discovery through the oeuvre that Martens created over 65 years—from his adventurous lettering on buildings, to books, typography, postage stamps, telephone cards, and wallpaper.  In this short film, you see Karel Martens at work in his studio, and former students share the most important lessons they learned from him.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/aOI7JNWUelt2kg09Q1FJNLwlGMU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karel Martens Unbound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5646857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Martens","original_name":"Karel Martens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z5s2zrwIoaS5fhtGycAEB6KHDkN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68ab8b493c99df3eaa448d0a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5646857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Martens","original_name":"Karel Martens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z5s2zrwIoaS5fhtGycAEB6KHDkN.jpg","credit_id":"68ab8a3f5c23d2d7b29db1e5","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Else Siemerink","original_name":"Else Siemerink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8a639319c60dab5480e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646904,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marc Scherpenzeel","original_name":"Marc Scherpenzeel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8a7af7de7344255483f3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3102933,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Terpstra","original_name":"Olivier Terpstra","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8a94bdd4f40c236ce80a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4574168,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Samantha Groesbeek","original_name":"Samantha Groesbeek","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8aa65c23d2d7b29db1e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3515975,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bart Voorsluis","original_name":"Bart Voorsluis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8ac2616c3d2ca86ce875","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646908,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Casper Corba","original_name":"Casper Corba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8ae4c9856d112a9db1b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denise van Schalkwijk","original_name":"Denise van Schalkwijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8afae1bddc0eaf1e544a","department":"Production","job":"Research Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Castro","original_name":"Thomas Castro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8b135911f7924aa9a3cc","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5646914,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margita van Vugt","original_name":"Margita van Vugt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ab8b236df466f10c6708d9","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2388,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aOI7JNWUelt2kg09Q1FJNLwlGMU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1592}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
