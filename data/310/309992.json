A rather talentless would-be hack substitutes his own script for the work of a deceased roommate who actually has some financing in place, and the result is a hilariously tasteless film within a film High School Shootings -The Musical. Over a hundred Vancouver area film school graduates, friends and musicians worked on this film.","popularity":0.2121,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shooting: The Musical","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"After Film School","type":"Original Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1284139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gigi Saul Guerrero","original_name":"Gigi Saul Guerrero","popularity":0.193,"profile_path":"/7hhER4BD8b5MLsZoSjeEDz9PGC9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mia","credit_id":"6532779248138200ac3a36a0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Ashton McCarthy","original_name":"Joel Ashton McCarthy","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55155c7b9251412cec00288b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Ashton McCarthy","original_name":"Joel Ashton McCarthy","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55155c729251410462003634","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3576220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
