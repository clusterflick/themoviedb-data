When war broke out, it was already riding high on a reputation derived from its successful blooding in the Spanish Civil War. 1941 saw the introduction of the Focke Wolf Fw-190 over the English Channel. Its superiority over the Spitfire Mk. V saw it rapidly become the Luftwaffe fighter arm's 'second iron' and was to play a major role in the widening conflict from 1941 onwards.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2ZD415Of0MpA62AvMr1yH2ZxcnT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"German Fighter Aircraft of WW2 - 39-42","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ZD415Of0MpA62AvMr1yH2ZxcnT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
