The film is an epic story in which the great events of the century -- women's suffrage, Prohibition, two World Wars, the Vanport Flood, the tumults of the '60s -- are experienced close-up, with the Rose Festival serving as an annual respite in the hard routines of life. From One Rose is a handsome and intelligent film that explores the intricate ways in which history affects communities and individuals at one and the same time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From One Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1280666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
