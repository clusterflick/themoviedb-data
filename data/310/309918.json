She has a hair-stylist friend in Rhea who has recently rented 'Billy's Family Salon' in Lokhandwala Complex from Vikram Raheja and hopes to attract many clients. But her hopes are dashed when Vikram asks her to vacate the premise until she comes up with Rs.52 Lakhs. Then two Gorakhpur-born naive males, Ram and Shyam Yadav, come to her for a make-over and blurt out that they are going to abduct Vikram's son, Aditya, and hold him until his father pays a huge ransom. Rhea and Megha ponder over this, decide to kidnap Aditya on their own, and hold him until his father pays them 52 Lakhs. They find out that the kidnapping is supposed to take place at a Mythological theme party, and they make all due preparations - not realizing that Murphy's Law will soon prevail and everything will get out of control.","popularity":0.3063,"poster_path":"/hc6FywreVaGRriXGE6srTL54vg0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mumbai Mast Kallander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shilpa Shukla","original_name":"Shilpa Shukla","popularity":0.431,"profile_path":"/tSOAtTPNJbIb2Ldp52XgW27exFD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rhea","credit_id":"5a538bda925141132c034aef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashraf Ul Haq","original_name":"Ashraf Ul Haq","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/yi4lOCJf6SIzhzh1RlhzI1670sQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shahenshah","credit_id":"5a538b7d9251411329033cb1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajendra Sethi","original_name":"Rajendra Sethi","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/orlzlhXtTA4ZXDJRUXKAEcnnlvz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vikram Raheja","credit_id":"5a538bb8c3a368754a0328d0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":129726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajesh Vivek","original_name":"Rajesh Vivek","popularity":0.1525,"profile_path":"/vMlXTIBYVx2B8JUtHri8xuEe6e8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Badey Bhaiya","credit_id":"5a538b650e0a2602690363ba","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Musavir Jaleel","original_name":"Musavir Jaleel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a538abdc3a368754a0327eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1900937","wikidata_id":"Q21001635","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1090,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hc6FywreVaGRriXGE6srTL54vg0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
