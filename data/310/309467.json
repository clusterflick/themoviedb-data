This background creates problems for him with other criminals who are closely connected to powerful politicians. As a result he is transferred to Bombay (now know as Mumbai). He takes charge of his post, and transforms everything to a diligent and honest policing machine. Unfortunately, politicians and criminals alike do not like his diligence, and talk about transferring him to Kashmir, where he will be killed in an encounter by a terrorist. Bhagat also comes in touch with suspended Police Inspector Sukhdev Singh, and gangleader, Rajnath Guru, the son of a freedom-fighter, Dinanathji (Aloknath).","popularity":0.4357,"poster_path":"/qirWALMnhUaYsH97ajRr9eu6oPj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Deadly Part","title":"Ansh","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharbani Mukherji","original_name":"Sharbani Mukherji","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/h6gp8WLq8TJZgSKYGnOVT5jC9uE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shweta","credit_id":"603f91d0a402c1006dfb27e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Om Puri","original_name":"Om Puri","popularity":0.4953,"profile_path":"/npVcDkdHSROXbMPUr45MGBJFQus.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bhagat Pandey","credit_id":"603f91689672ed00700abf18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashutosh Rana","original_name":"Ashutosh Rana","popularity":1.2236,"profile_path":"/jFlhAoEP3KGEXO3SXCA4YLM2Goc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sukhdev Singh","credit_id":"603f9175f74f5f0030c5a9a5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alok Nath","original_name":"Alok Nath","popularity":0.4324,"profile_path":"/fMtqIj07e2HD0i5YbV91kgjrZzm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dina Nathji","credit_id":"603f922a124c8d0026c32f16","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ravi Kishan","original_name":"रवि किशन","popularity":0.6564,"profile_path":"/rkUTRk0tuA98RepP9jhgcCbhHqy.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Doble","credit_id":"603f9296124c8d005996d430","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajat Bedi","original_name":"Rajat Bedi","popularity":0.2526,"profile_path":"/h6hJw3QLAoJjZBvdxHF2QhTR3PO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Munna","credit_id":"603f91e8c433ea0059a74414","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashish Vidhyarthi","original_name":"Ashish Vidhyarthi","popularity":0.5398,"profile_path":"/iBUUpfHZIfpC5afHrHwcyGTHKQF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dawoo","credit_id":"603f91f3c4ad5900456dbf5f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sayaji Shinde","original_name":"Sayaji Shinde","popularity":0.4587,"profile_path":"/r4VBYop4XktGuSZ0wozRqJbEzMH.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Govind","credit_id":"603f91ffede1b000456824b0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1765645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shama Sikander","original_name":"Shama Sikander","popularity":0.2129,"profile_path":"/sB9NC0rNeXzHERBQ4SkBVd1Alrp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kusum","credit_id":"603f91dcede1b0005ae75e5f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abbas","original_name":"Abbas","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/gxIFUlmgoRHBHdSABjJi2lWxkIJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rajnath Guru","credit_id":"603f91b720e6a5002216a6c5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milind Gunaji","original_name":"Milind Gunaji","popularity":0.1822,"profile_path":"/8KJ8YEgbi7mb0YvZj8XVpDSB1Xq.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Babu Bakshi","credit_id":"603f9218c433ea006e6c6cd5","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajan Johri","original_name":"Rajan Johri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603f9146d35dea0022a53540","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0315777","wikidata_id":"Q21646098","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2116,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qirWALMnhUaYsH97ajRr9eu6oPj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1411}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
