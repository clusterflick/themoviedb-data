Nineteen-year-old Wang Baihe is a migrant worker from a village in Shaanxi province. She has a baby son from a one-night stand with a man from Hong Kong and a small income from making Chinese decorative knots at home. Her dream is to open a noodle restaurant and “make lots of money and become a city person” but she finds it difficult to find regular employment because of her baby boy. Her story emerges through interviews with journalist Liu Nan, who is writing a book about her. When Baihe discovers her son has congenital heart disease, she tries desperate ways to raise the RMB80,000 (US$12,000) for the operation, helped by her friend and fellow migrant worker Hu Jinling.","popularity":0.0794,"poster_path":"/7ihI8EI964ziV5ak6bQT7jqo7XJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Huaxia Film Distribution","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2010-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lü Liping","original_name":"Lü Liping","popularity":0.2339,"profile_path":"/rOXUN6qQ6p1KCIb2Lcpgh5ZORHw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5485f902c3a3680b3a003f19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Zitong","original_name":"Wang Zitong","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5485f915c3a3680b48002cb8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Ziheng","original_name":"Wang Ziheng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ttejmnjdxxohvKJvs4nmb7mX3Mh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5485f9319251416a6c0037c0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhou Xiaowen","original_name":"Xiaowen Zhou","popularity":0.2048,"profile_path":"/nuR7Vo2vR8QII0kqgCz9Hfxb0b6.jpg","credit_id":"5485f8f99251416a6c0037b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/amiiWz6pqAYEupWI3LSMxbwqA5A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ihI8EI964ziV5ak6bQT7jqo7XJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
