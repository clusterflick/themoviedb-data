She died of a single shot gun blast to the chest then finished off by decapitation. Madge’s head was buried somewhere in the area of Yellow Ridge. Legend has it that if you go to a particular part of the woods at a particular time of day you can see the ghost of Madge Hooper wandering around in the woods looking for her head.
