When advance men for the title bandits show up to lay the groundwork for a raid, they round up all available hostages but one. That one is the film's lone hero (Chang Yi), whose motivation is simply stated—he's there to check up on family—but no one believes him. At the thirty-minute mark, he launches into an eight-minute battle with the two bandit chieftains, hand-to-hand with one (Sammo Hung) and swordplay with the other (an actor I didn't recognize). It's a well-staged brawl and it spreads all over the empty town.","popularity":0.1631,"poster_path":"/goshBmzbizLdm1xRlpa6OsEqDoF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bandits from Shantung","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shaolin from Shantung","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Shan Dong Xiang Ma","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"산동향마 (1972) (山東珦馬)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bandits from Shan Tung","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chang Yi","original_name":"Chang Yi","popularity":0.3691,"profile_path":"/9Kb0IVLfTrGsT7QJgWY2beawSaD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Yan Tie-Yi","credit_id":"5a241aa692514103300c3754","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pai Ying","original_name":"白鹰","popularity":0.4631,"profile_path":"/w0gpzw73WmMvrZP8WkGGhorYY05.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bandit Chief","credit_id":"5a241ad2c3a3680b960c86a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hu Chin","original_name":"Hu Chin","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/nItG3Z16NCzWB6ZQyEDvRk9gYrf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lotus Shi","credit_id":"5a241aad0e0a264cc10c614b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Tong","original_name":"Wilson Tong","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/2U90rjQCbIHPkWw6dez7PLeHtIA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Xi brother","credit_id":"5a3c15aec3a36814a80aa6f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammo Hung Kam-Bo","original_name":"洪金寶","popularity":1.8117,"profile_path":"/odHszmZ4uj2Hj4EE03js8IsswJb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"5th boss","credit_id":"5a3c15509251410336231323","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Huang Feng","original_name":"Huang Feng","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":"/4InDxJSfwi7z6Sg20QcM6NTYsAJ.jpg","credit_id":"66cda1d919f6fb629b682027","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Huang Feng","original_name":"Huang Feng","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":"/4InDxJSfwi7z6Sg20QcM6NTYsAJ.jpg","credit_id":"66cda1bd26e3698316b344f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0078242","wikidata_id":"Q4854635","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/toGWgLm9FZlcayCVTeOUB5e7Xfz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eDdRluy0ULBtvG2OnbGg1e8Naue.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.422,"height":296,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/4qnkGvODvCP2C7YQVfXDo6ifBr7.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":717}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/tVHheyOIO6Xw86MA5vcs3PurUx4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.644,"height":1212,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/goshBmzbizLdm1xRlpa6OsEqDoF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/hAQuWJkAARgxkrVfmHd5knXDyYp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.688,"height":1047,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/86fny9opmszGXc9UoitIsRykLXh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rUmTjhhv0QxEdty5q2aNKLKF3tQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/nbqUpBB1RMcWcD3j4NKecYo62tl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":779,"name":"martial arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
