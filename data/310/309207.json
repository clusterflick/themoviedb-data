In order to maintain his lifestyle, he is persuaded by a good friend to adopt the newly rich self-made millionaire Otto Meier and his family. With a title of nobility, Otto and his family would finally come to social recognition. Emanuel, in turn, would not have to worry about covering his bank account. At first, worlds collide in the dreadful count and the shrill Meier clan - until a common enemy fuses the unequal \"adoptive family\" firmly together.","popularity":0.2529,"poster_path":"/axHyc0YVBj0JGNNmeVrVfH3Mlke.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gräfliches Roulette","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Wepper","original_name":"Fritz Wepper","popularity":0.3276,"profile_path":"/fhdJ20v0xpFo2yF0TFDsyNk53kA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emanuel Graf zu Trips","credit_id":"54862b1fc3a3682612000199","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Lansink","original_name":"Leonard Lansink","popularity":0.1807,"profile_path":"/coNhXk0GKODmDDj9LI1XihC2M7Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Otto Meier","credit_id":"54862b319251410ddf000130","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Thaler","original_name":"Karin Thaler","popularity":0.4578,"profile_path":"/fOObh9ZzIVDBgOPrqqjoBeOWFDO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Edith Meier","credit_id":"54862b41c3a368262100013a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Schüte","original_name":"Anja Schüte","popularity":0.2689,"profile_path":"/qrBeo4VkyiYTXnO5lCHzhUMiUVd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Beatrice Gräfin von Arnau","credit_id":"54862b4fc3a368261000017d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Brandl","original_name":"Markus Brandl","popularity":0.1873,"profile_path":"/2uDaHFygsKcP3vyQQVMx4a28CZt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Adrian Neureuter","credit_id":"55e59d6f92514137a000236e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Muth","original_name":"Frank Muth","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Raphael Neureuter","credit_id":"5a779d9b9251417754006f18","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrich König","original_name":"Ulrich König","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54862b10c3a368262500016b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1579954","wikidata_id":"Q123553626","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/axHyc0YVBj0JGNNmeVrVfH3Mlke.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
