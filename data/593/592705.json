A bunch of Englishmen have turned up at the casting for a film that turns out to be the one we are sitting and watching. A mixed gallery of characters, who paradoxically are hoping to be cast in the roles of themselves. 'I was Here' is a social experiment with brains, a heart and underplayed humour. The many attendees are as diverse as people are in the real world. Young and old, funny and bitter, self-confident and nervous - what are they hoping to find by taking part in a film? The obvious answer is the simplest one: themselves. We look on from the other side of the camera, as they take part in the experiment. The contradiction between authenticity and performance is not just a question of identity. It is also one of the basic conflicts of modern documentary filmmaking, which Ola Jankowska and Nathalie Bianchieri turn into both a premise and a method.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Authenticity vs performance in a mischievous film about the casting for a film, which turns out to be the one we are watching.","title":"I  was Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2280199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ola Jankowska","original_name":"Ola Jankowska","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/cykp3BugtxTG3or6TQnusrNhITf.jpg","credit_id":"5ca4900f0e0a26015ea87df4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathalie Biancheri","original_name":"Nathalie Biancheri","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca490440e0a26015ca86ca2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
