It's a play thing. And it put me into something that I didn't get out of too easy and so soon.\"  The pigs, taught to stand beside their brimming slop trough with heads bowed while Johnson prayed over their food, dug in with gusto when he finally released them to eat.  Johnson died in 1980, but the four minute film is a lasting reminder of his special pig training talents.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/tkrRKVghPqxWtkiQAgCJBO5cKEu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hush Hoggies Hush: Tom Johnson's Praying Pigs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278578,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karen Sawyer","original_name":"Karen Sawyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca137fa9251412c0e07eb88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1871100,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Judy Peiser","original_name":"Judy Peiser","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca137e30e0a265986fbcd18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1871099,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bill Ferris","original_name":"Bill Ferris","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/qUOvY5rgQMOCMeMPDjDSQQ7nuk9.jpg","credit_id":"5ca137d6c3a368735984b420","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278577,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Randy Robertson","original_name":"Randy Robertson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca137eec3a368734e850509","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tkrRKVghPqxWtkiQAgCJBO5cKEu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
