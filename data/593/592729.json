Palestine creates a kind of composite instrument in motion as well as an \"articulated personal drama\". His stated desire for escape is contained by the boundaries of the island. Palestine was a trained cantor, and he often used his moving body and sustained vocalizing to generate a physical and aural intensity in his musical/video performances of this period.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jOsnWYnefZbKwwtXwYILL5oUcpw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293955,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charlemagne Palestine","original_name":"Charlemagne Palestine","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca4b8580e0a260150a8a436","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jOsnWYnefZbKwwtXwYILL5oUcpw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
