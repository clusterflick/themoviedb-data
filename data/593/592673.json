In FLOODING JOB'S GARDEN, Boyce Richardson revisits communities he first filmed in the 1970s, before Hydro Quebec began its work, documenting 20 years of massive change in Cree country. As Bourassa and Hydro Quebec prepare for Phase 2, the Crees are mounting an international campaign to protect the environment and ensure responsible development.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flooding Job's Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boyce Richardson","original_name":"Boyce Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca430750e0a260150a7fe71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118088,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Cullingham","original_name":"James Cullingham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca432000e0a260152a8033e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Martin","original_name":"Kent Martin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ezSZ5qCaOu7PfbzgYjY8UVCAe31.jpg","credit_id":"5ca4327c0e0a260164a80645","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca432ac0e0a260164a8065b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boyce Richardson","original_name":"Boyce Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca432f69251412df61d9773","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225757","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
