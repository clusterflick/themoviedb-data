The mass media reproduces and celebrates the image of Vegas based on gratuity and transgression. LAS VEGAS IN 16 PARTS proposes a flirtatious dialogue with this collective perception through an aesthetic of appropriation. The film cannibalizes the sheen of the cityâ€™s voracious capacity for spectacle: from the 1950s, when atomic explosion tests became another tourist attraction, to the present, when a male stripper turns police brutality into the sensual fantasy of a bachelorette. A documentary about a concrete city, it inversely aspires to be a fiction of an improbable collective fantasy.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lbVC0h9F4ZcqiKye5CGum2vb8f4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las Vegas in 16 Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luciano Piazza","original_name":"Luciano Piazza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca120679251411a2507ee04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5664716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lbVC0h9F4ZcqiKye5CGum2vb8f4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
