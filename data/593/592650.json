Revolted, the islanders, supported by an adventurer who desires Phroso, rise against the new master. The English are saved by the British governor, also under the spell of gorgeous Phroso. The latter, for her part, is not wholly insensitive to Lord Wheatley's distinction. The imbroglio still worsens with the meddling of a dark horse : the neighboring sultan.","popularity":0.1221,"poster_path":"/3H1omwZOfNW77VyKjfNFV7fjn1P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1922-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phroso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malvina Longfellow","original_name":"Malvina Longfellow","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/qs6s9rDsmrYKXUUMvyTc4911X6L.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Phroso","credit_id":"5ca3ec8592514140c94a6ae1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Owen","original_name":"Reginald Owen","popularity":0.5382,"profile_path":"/a7PEC3JPysPo4OoOqOIagDFZmNB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lord Wheatley","credit_id":"5ca3eca3c3a3682b2411f54d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Vanel","original_name":"Charles Vanel","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/dznVyOfBuL2cTDucr0xOpzp6iGT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dimitri","credit_id":"5ca3ecbac3a3682b2711ffcd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Mercanton","original_name":"Louis Mercanton","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/mBee6lzFUmPS403M3lbTpRTa0Wj.jpg","credit_id":"5ca3ec6d92514140d34a58c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0013498","wikidata_id":"Q27959187","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3H1omwZOfNW77VyKjfNFV7fjn1P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":745}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1922-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
