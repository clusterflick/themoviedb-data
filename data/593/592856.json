A place of life for Algerians, the Cinémathèque was the hub of African cinemas. Created in 1965 by Ahmed Hocine, Mahieddine Moussaoui and Jean-Michel Arnold, the Cinémathèque benefited from the excitement of Independence. The Cinematheque becomes a meeting place for Algiers society, future filmmakers find their best school there. In 1969, the Algiers Pan-African Festival brought together all African filmmakers, and from 1970, Boudjemâa Kareche developed a collection of Arab and African films.","popularity":0.2815,"poster_path":"/2iyLfKQxu4kKgocHjTRX22NYs6h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206137,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la
