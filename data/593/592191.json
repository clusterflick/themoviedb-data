Central characters in the narrative are Hermes, in the form of a seal, and Pegasus the mythological horse, both bearing witness to the voyage of the imagination, unhindered by the straight jacket of history and time. The animation has a dual meaning; it is both symbolic meditation on a journey into the unknown through the eyes of Pegasus and the seal, both hoping to heal wounds and create a sense of unity in their universe and also an exploration of the geographical history of the Thames and Rhine, which 10,000 years ago formed one single river.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/Ag3BqofU9gsrIqtUNkbI4fb7Kbj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marriage of the Thames and the Rhine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Epoh Beech","original_name":"Epoh Beech","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca114f0c3a368734e84b983","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1754663","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ag3BqofU9gsrIqtUNkbI4fb7Kbj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1021}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
