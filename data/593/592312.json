In the first, Smihi re-stages the Marrakech market scene from Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much, in which a monkey trainer makes children dance for tourists. In the second, two lovers meet on the ramparts of Orson Welles’s Essaouira locations for Othello and speak of their own forbidden love. And in the third, set in Smihi’s home town of Tangier, an old sailor dreams of vanquishing a sea monster: the Gibraltar ferry that connects Europe to Africa.","popularity":0.0598,"poster_path":"/p6zw6ZZJyGfA7LLKiPGWxh7OaDv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"1999-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moroccan Chronicles","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Chroniques marocaines","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","title":"Waqa'i maghribia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aïcha Mahmah","original_name":"Aïcha Mahmah","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1e257c3a368735b85648e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tarik Jamil","original_name":"Tarik Jamil","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1e2609251411a1808fc62","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miloud Habachi","original_name":"Miloud Habachi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1e26bc3a3687344858aac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soumaya Akaaboune","original_name":"Soumaya Akaaboune","popularity":0.3269,"profile_path":"/8oD3VQWAtfPwiMEo1i9wbdEIdkx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1e2809251411a2508c65f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmed S.
