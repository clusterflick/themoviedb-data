To celebrate her birthday Adi, the young poet she loves, steals a car and takes off with her to a beach. The two lovers do not realise that the car belongs to a thug who is following them - a thug who will not hesitate to kill. SUNETRA can be seen as a metaphor for life itself, where death is always hiding behind the trees.  As always, the Babusenan Brothers are exploring their philosophical concerns here through the medium of the film
