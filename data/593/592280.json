The temple is called Kôun’in whose roof has a tale passed down from ancient times.  The tale is based on the myth of dragon god: Once upon a time at a brumous crack of dawn, all kinds of snakes magically flocked to a waterfall. As soon as they merged into a single huge serpent, it started to fly up heavenward. But when it incarnadined his body with the red color of the roof, it transformed itself into a rising dragon.","popularity":0.087,"poster_path":"/A4pA1IQqcPhSv8SZCYJTLDsM9kD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Above the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kumo no ue","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211279,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toranosuke Aizawa","original_name":"相澤虎之助","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1b0ad9251412c0e085e5c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahide Nishimura","original_name":"Masahide Nishimura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1b0ba0e0a26179af73819","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsuyoshi Takano","original_name":"Tsuyoshi Takano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1b0c89251412c0e085e65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akemi Furuya","original_name":"Akemi Furuya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1b0d70e0a26598efc38e8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umika Araki","original_name":"Umika Araki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca1b0e60e0a265986fc4f6f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115165,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katsuya Tomita","original_name":"富田克也","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/jvOlygXPlXtaDu9NTQUUyDQ4vH3.jpg","credit_id":"5ca1b07f0e0a26179af737b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8931692","wikidata_id":"Q39071646","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":896,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/A4pA1IQqcPhSv8SZCYJTLDsM9kD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
