He is accompanied by his former student and biographer in this journey, with whom he shares a complex relationship. As the disease continues to corrode his body and mind, the professor has to grapple with a memory that eludes him, regrets that haunt him and questions that he is yet to find answers to. Much like the veil of mist shrouding the valley, a great existential crisis envelops him. With the ghosts of his past resurfacing and the present turning into a nightmare, is it too late for him to seek redemption?","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/xTRTCS8lOrKZSJ17aaehFdxvD3J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Certain lives in Twilight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1880895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Praveen M Sukumaran","original_name":"Praveen M Sukumaran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca499979251412dff1e19d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sreekala Praveen","original_name":"Sreekala Praveen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca49977c3a3685ab00c451e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1880895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Praveen M Sukumaran","original_name":"Praveen M Sukumaran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca499530e0a260158a87b60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":753,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eGTDaEdqFO2xrcSGCMHStiX9Fm6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1338}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xTRTCS8lOrKZSJ17aaehFdxvD3J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
