An athletics competition and a lost Walkman set in motion a chain of events that will mark the lives of a group of friends, rivals and enemies forever. Shy, wealthy Qian, extrovert Cheng, troubled Su, academically gifted Wang, charismatic athlete Teng Xiao and student president Yang are all linked in a web of friendships and hatreds, secrets, violent conflicts and passionate attachments. None emerges unscarred, and some of the wounds run deep. Years later, a series of encounters draw them back together, but the shadow of the past hangs heavy. Can they redeem themselves – and exorcise the ghosts of their youth – or is tragedy inevitable?","popularity":0.2739,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Where It Begins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Where It Begins","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1724348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhang Yichi","original_name":"Zhang Yichi","popularity":0.2724,"profile_path":"/8y56Efd4AytO0kcpVqrrbrm2aAI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca518d39251412df81ede5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2280420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ding Yujia","original_name":"Ding Yujia","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/tD4KwuarfozON3VY9SUncyQls5Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca518f59251412df01ee00d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2280423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhou Yiran","original_name":"周依然","popularity":0.6302,"profile_path":"/3T1oJq6ODZahHvtqDxfzzIDpdSo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca5191dc3a3685ab30d2299","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1668475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sun Yihan","original_name":"孫伊涵","popularity":0.448,"profile_path":"/yojUxsp6m6OAQCmqaemwqPSeCim.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca5192b0e0a260164a96507","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1780717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ding Guansen","original_name":"丁冠森","popularity":0.2075,"profile_path":"/iuf2pu3drbiYMsqW3DEIbpxaPt8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca5194c0e0a260152a956b6","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
