A play takes place, where no text is written but where everyone knows his role on the fingertips. The actors, since distant times, have all the same suit: a black blouse and a cane. During this short lapse of time, they are going to confront themselves, to flee, to catch, to tap on the shoulder, to laugh and to have a row, to love and to hate themselves. These actors of a moment are the traders in cattle of the market of Laissac.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":"/iiNe6bXh7lxMWHLp81EO5A2fXcR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Négociant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Roussilhe","original_name":"Philippe Roussilhe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca5973c9251415ebe6bf5a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7667060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iiNe6bXh7lxMWHLp81EO5A2fXcR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
