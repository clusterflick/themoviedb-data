Dotson also “blows the bottle” using a Coca-Cola bottle partially filled with water. Both his bottle blowing and his one-strand-on-the-wall are important links between African musical roots and the blues. The one-strand marks the beginning of the “slide guitar” style which heavily influenced 20th-century blues, rock and roll, and rock music.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pAeTlY6fFS41ynuPM7doUaSysI6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bottle Up and Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1871099,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bill Ferris","original_name":"Bill Ferris","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/qUOvY5rgQMOCMeMPDjDSQQ7nuk9.jpg","credit_id":"5ca13a43c3a3687355849e61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAeTlY6fFS41ynuPM7doUaSysI6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
