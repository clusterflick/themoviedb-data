The play's main role of Geesche is played by Annick. But what does it mean to make a fictional character come to life when that character is so close to one's own experiences ? A number of questions arise concerning the impact of Geesche's story on the intimate and collective life of the actors and actresses involved in the play. Annick, Georges, Jean-Pascal, Jean-Paul, Anne, Nordine, Felix, Stephane and Marie-Pierre question how their real lives overlap with their theatrical roles. These questions eventually develop into a common reflection on how psychiatry, patriarchal violence and social constructions are ultimately interwoven.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/i9ntnl6AxCu7VHvVvtaZHi9RLXJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What If the Sky Was Empty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thissa d'Avila Bensalah","original_name":"Thissa d'Avila Bensalah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zy2grwRKLjp573Nct0wrgtp1Ed2.jpg","credit_id":"5ca1bdd60e0a265977fc96e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8561314","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9ntnl6AxCu7VHvVvtaZHi9RLXJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":596}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
