The impetus to making the film was the book of the same name by the Russian religious philosopher Vasily Rozanov, who died 100 years ago. His treatise was devoted to the study of sexuality and its denial in Christianity.  The film was made in the style of experimental films of the 1920s with a non-linear narration full of strange surrealistic images. He is black and white and devoid of dialogue. Filmed on film 16 mm of firm \"Svema\", released in the USSR. This added to his exoticism. The image was put to the music of Alexander Scriabin “The Poem of Ecstasy” (1907).","popularity":0.0869,"poster_path":"/1JDWx4qoqJSEJNuFYPp480sD8Xu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moonlight People","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2281183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Jadrovsky","original_name":"Yuri Jadrovsky","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/7iLfkhLIhODcbXk03kyYEXndJkz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Первый мужчина","credit_id":"5ca66ec69251410598440d35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2024428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Zolotar","original_name":"Владимир Золотарь","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/aNU5tQqr18r8fbC3iDO9HXUMVfv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Второй мужчина","credit_id":"5ca66edd9251410586441a70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2024483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Surkova","original_name":"Natalya Surkova","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":"/99CBFvYV3JRABEwahFYXi8vg4Lj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Первая женщина","credit_id":"5ca66ef3c3a368613f1726f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2281184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daria Alymova","original_name":"Дарья Алымова","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rr5DKtVH1oASau2MVm4vsfN3v9m.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Вторая женщина","credit_id":"5ca66f080e0a2657cfa041a9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1829381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitri Frolov","original_name":"Dmitri Frolov","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/kUaMQo82VlxvKR5DgtO66MbhZZx.jpg","credit_id":"5ca66f35c3a368613f17276a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1829381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitri Frolov","original_name":"Dmitri Frolov","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/kUaMQo82VlxvKR5DgtO66MbhZZx.jpg","credit_id":"5fecc60ee004a6003f286b49","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10127944","wikidata_id":"Q77892609","facebook_id":"MoonlightPeopl","instagram_id":"moonlight_peopl","twitter_id":"MOONLIGHT_PEOPL"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sdc9HK6XtOhS2STLZK55Pq3LUrx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6U8f4yI0F09sgZxiXorJFbX0qu8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y4DzTy0IIDw7VO3sXOabjVsmQIL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1310,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1JDWx4qoqJSEJNuFYPp480sD8Xu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":874},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aUE2tKCOMvnkYY3iK90l23vkNiM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v8jXSbGUFKbCp0kNjkoV2Uvxscj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":11130,"name":"art house"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":190200,"name":"short compilation"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OtherMovie 8th Lugano Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
