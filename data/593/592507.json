The company runs out of money, and it looks as though Mamie and her dancing colleagues are going to be stranded in Europe with no way home. Luckily, she meets a handsome, well-spoken Englishman Peter Millett (Hulbert), who falls in love with her and proposes marriage. Under the impression that he is a man of means, she readily accepts, imagining an entrÃ©e to English high society. The couple return to England and Mamie discovers to her horror that not only is her new home a decrepit farmhouse out in the sticks, but that Peter is a widower and his three children also come as part of the package.","popularity":0.4737,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":180537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Brothers-First National Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1937-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Live and Learn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenda Farrell","original_name":"Glenda Farrell","popularity":0.2628,"profile_path":"/xBaAWMgCzVpzMzK2bmA8bkmSGm2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mamie Wallis","credit_id":"6570b045596a91012c5ce5f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Hulbert","original_name":"Claude Hulbert","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/b07VGteP3abZTftpmJw04Og7Q63.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Peter Millett","credit_id":"6570b0530d1e7f014d5b3fe8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Alyn","original_name":"Glen Alyn","popularity":0.1132,"profile_path":"/bEADi04ow0b5cFDhHtdQuNBVw5G.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dot Harris","credit_id":"65bccbd611c066017bd262b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carol","original_name":"John Carol","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"George","credit_id":"65bccbe9cffeed0163ae0c6b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Stephenson","original_name":"James Stephenson","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/zVMYn8Vo2nXK4dPCjpwleGoC970.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sam Brooks","credit_id":"65bccc03c144dd0163ff610f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Finn","original_name":"Arthur Finn","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Joseph P.
