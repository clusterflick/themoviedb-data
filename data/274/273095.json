This is an investigation of planes as they are parked during the economic downturn, stored and recycled, revealing unexpected connections between economy, violence and spectacle, finding perfect example in the form of the Boeing 4X-JYI, an aircraft first acquired by film director Howard Hughes for TWA, which was subsequently flown by the Israeli Airforce before finding its way to the Californian desert to be blown up for the Hollywood blockbuster Speed. Through intertwined narratives of people, planes and places Steyerl reveals cycles of capitalism incorporating and adapting to the changing status of the commodity, but also points at a horizon beyond this endless repetition.","popularity":0.2669,"poster_path":"/md9Zkz1tciaU835bCUgrjseCgEN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Free Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hito Steyerl","original_name":"Hito Steyerl","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/dL8oPhT9JdVYfPqvGUK8CrODNgY.jpg","credit_id":"538964530e0a261459000b25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mPhJNCYlMV0pJu1QUUzI3j9PNR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/md9Zkz1tciaU835bCUgrjseCgEN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
