Hans Keller visited the same countries and places in order to make a film about the life and work of this man, who could only live in hotels. Keller creates a beautiful synthesis between Europe as Roth knew it and the present-day Europe. In the loving look at the different locations, the continuity of past and present reveals itself. Intermittently, tableaux in a copied 'Bioskoptheater' show scenes from the author's life. Finally, a film script which was once rejected by Hollywood yet comes alive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joseph Roth's Grosse-Welt-Bioskop-Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hans Keller","original_name":"Hans Keller","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"538b1fe2c3a368713c000e9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
