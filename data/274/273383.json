On a desert mesa outside Santa Fe, Richard Tuttle invents his mysterious and marvellously humble forms, made of wire, cardboard, wood. In Taos, Agnes Martin rhythmically repeats extremely simplified images. Near the Santa Monica surf, John Baldessari, aims for successful juxtapositions of photographs and text. In his North Hollywood living room, Robert Williams revels in surreal cartoon imagery. At a cabin in Woodstock, Joan Snyder refines her sensuous art amid a lush forest. Mike Bidlo salutes Duchamp in a SoHo Gallery, while on Sunset Boulevard, Amy Adler reclaims personal history through self-portraits. Through this group of memorable iconoclasts, the creative \"act\" is there to see and study.","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":"/tjG8Q3Xrku4hYDFhs6S3wNVS8T0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art City 2 Simplicity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Tuttle","original_name":"Richard Tuttle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61698c0890dde0002ac49183","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554054,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Maybach","original_name":"Chris Maybach","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61698b19924ce600247e6854","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0188424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tjG8Q3Xrku4hYDFhs6S3wNVS8T0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
