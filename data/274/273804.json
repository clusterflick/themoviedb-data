What if you had to spend that eternity stuck in a cemetery with only a limbless corpse for a friend, and cantankerous \"residents\" that were anything but resting in peace? That's the situation for Rue Morgan, night watchman extraordinaire, in this rollicking supernatural adventure-comedy. Rue, along with his buddy Herb, spends his nights watching out for zombies, and his days dreaming of a date with hard-nosed day-shifter, Claire. It's an okay eternity--until a scourge of paranormal occurrences leaves Rue not only watching the cemetery, but also watching his back! Based on the hit short film that critics have called \"delightful\", \"charming\", and \"unapologetically goofy\", \"The Night Shift\" is guaranteed to be the most fun you've ever had in a cemetery!","popularity":0.1361,"poster_path":"/sXBcQM6RaTfzlR4Tr9QGyS2lrCp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fighting Owl Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night Shift","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3601053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khristian Fulmer","original_name":"Khristian Fulmer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tlLJLGMOWhWsv9fXn7qaoNDJBCK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rue Morgan","credit_id":"646b0940d1857201802da894","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718619,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erin Lilley","original_name":"Erin Lilley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fNxuDEv6ZoTblGqsdQk5hAcgfFh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Claire Rennfield","credit_id":"646b096ea5046e016837b302","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2573881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan O'Neil Smith","original_name":"Nathan O'Neil Smith","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/zCzXxBLnT6hiPvsZQGFRyooIdK0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Giles","credit_id":"646b099733a376011ec4a887","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2751389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bennett Wayne Dean Sr.","original_name":"Bennett Wayne Dean Sr.","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/ohNu2jt2VwuxSTBwefmXJlE0aui.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"George","credit_id":"646b09ab2bcf6700fe614912","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2869296,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Soren Odom","original_name":"Soren Odom","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/r2h2RfcmM6n0LlZGB4tDD8b08kw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herbie","credit_id":"646b09c8a5046e012468a24d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4074501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Woodall","original_name":"Jordan Woodall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Curly","credit_id":"646b09e257530e07875426e6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Pruitt","original_name":"Jonathan Pruitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Capt.
