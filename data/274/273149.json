Sweet Petunia, a charming young rhubarb, is forced to flee her homeland and live in a tree stump in a foreign land. When the Duke learns of the Princess's plight, he risks his life to help her and learns that true love means thinking of others first. Filled with serf music, Three Dog Knights, hurling catapults of slime and loads of silliness, Duke and the Great Pie War delivers a royal lesson in loving your family. Plus, Laura the Carrot stars in Baby Sitter In DeNile - a charming retelling of the story of Miriam and Moses.","popularity":0.9378,"poster_path":"/88IbAKTE8tvJN7C4ExdxrUDx5JC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56670,"logo_path":null,"name":"DKP Studios","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":3204,"logo_path":"/kHOVsKg00Fn4hixW7UwMwrng4sj.png","name":"Big Idea Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VeggieTales: Duke and the Great Pie War","video":true,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Os Vegetais â€“ Duque e a Grande Guerra de Torta","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"VeggieTales - Duke and the Great Pie War","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Vischer","original_name":"Phil Vischer","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/8qp9W0m8ZspnfeV2T71td6LWmsr.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Abbot / Lucas / Irwin / Novak / Otis / Guard / Knight (voice)","credit_id":"53ea64b2c3a3680ec1001395","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Nawrocki","original_name":"Mike Nawrocki","popularity":0.2638,"profile_path":"/30Su5P2XK9F91YGZ8MDQqGCPzgx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Duke / Oscar / Guard (voice)","credit_id":"53ea64cec3a3680ec1001399","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cydney Trent","original_name":"Cydney Trent","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/rHakfp5993v2iytDgHNVQjI0lJ1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Petunia / Nona / Miriam / Mother / Baby Moses (voice)","credit_id":"53ea64fec3a3680ec4001380","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Hodge","original_name":"Tim Hodge","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/dBUh4zG0LhGALo9NzltZT7uERVn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Blind Lemon Lincoln / Father (voice)","credit_id":"53ea6510c3a3680eb500134f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Volkman Jackson","original_name":"Charlotte Volkman Jackson","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Pharoh's Daughter (voice)","credit_id":"5ec7e7296c849200202d9840","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Hodge","original_name":"Tim Hodge","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/dBUh4zG0LhGALo9NzltZT7uERVn.jpg","credit_id":"53ea6556c3a3680ec4001385","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Fisher","original_name":"Jim Fisher","popularity":0.1437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ea656ec3a3680ec70013c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82460,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert G.
