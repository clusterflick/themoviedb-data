A retro act before the term was even coined, John Cohen's band looked backwards for inspiration, and found much to love in the distinctly old fashioned sound of old- time string bands. The unclassifiable Greenbriar Boys also put in a good showing, weaving their inimitable magic that encompasses elements of country, blues, and bluegrass styles.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainbow Quest: New Lost City Ramblers and Green Briar Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
