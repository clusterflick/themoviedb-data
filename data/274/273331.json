Blues divas such as Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and Alberta Hunter created and promoted a working-class vision of blues life that provided an alternative to the Victorian gentility of middle-class manners. In their lives and music, blues women presented themselves as strong, independent women who lived hard lives and were unapologetic about their unconventional choices in clothes, recreational activities, and bed partners. Blues singers disseminated a Black feminism that celebrated emotional resilience and sexual pleasure, no matter the source.","popularity":0.4803,"poster_path":"/8uHWtXYf9BKKk617vHBxnNf0nkM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shoga Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"T'Ain't Nobody's Bizness: Queer Blues Divas of the 1920s","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2074606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jewelle Gomez","original_name":"Jewelle Gomez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5b363aee0e0a263ff6027b45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Albertson","original_name":"Chris Albertson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b363b0b0e0a263fff029f48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Keizer","original_name":"Brian Keizer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b363b180e0a26400202c4ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Tillery","original_name":"Linda Tillery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b363ba90e0a263fff029fa6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Philipson","original_name":"Robert Philipson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"538b1a7cc3a3687155000dbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1821627","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":888,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8uHWtXYf9BKKk617vHBxnNf0nkM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":596},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qASxI3H34iTxm2u8CyJ8eMatHto.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":2636,"name":"blues"},{"id":15136,"name":"female homosexuality"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":204027,"name":"black awareness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Out in the Desert Film Festival)","release_date":"2013-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
