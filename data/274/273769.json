In the tradition of Ross McElwee, Mills created an autobiographical film in which she meditates on a universal human theme with a camera strapped to her bike. It is a contemplative response to \"An Inconvenient Truth\" and provides a unique perspective on one person's attempt to reduce her carbon footprint and overcome fear.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Mr. Gore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1482424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
