Adapted from Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s love story, the film was innovative in its special effects and an early major box-office hit. A beautiful tinted restoration print was prepared using photochemical processes by Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia-Cineteca Nazionale in the mid-1990s and the premiere screening of the restoration print was held in the amphitheatre in Pompeii, followed by a screening at the major restoration festival ‘Il Cinema Ritrovato’ in Bologna in 1998.","popularity":0.3993,"poster_path":"/9wUAqCJgwJLp775ChC5GNdBQ5xb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Italiana Grandi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1926-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":196,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Days of Pompeii","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Last Days of Pompeii","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Varconi","original_name":"Victor Varconi","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/aX8xp2GEriKwjOf3t4MrTOHC00G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Glauco","credit_id":"538aeab9c3a3687155000a49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":581964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rina De Liguoro","original_name":"Rina De Liguoro","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/7gq9UQj5509rrLqdXyASBipmbkz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ione","credit_id":"538aead3c3a368714b000a87","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1301248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Corda","original_name":"María Corda","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/fUMkMY5d3sYxSHKmrvP14Q85QJ4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nydia","credit_id":"538aeaebc3a368714b000a8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernhard Goetzke","original_name":"Bernhard Goetzke","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/aWymfDS3b84yh2mkkpk96dtImsj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Arbace","credit_id":"538aeb10c3a3687146000ab9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Ghione","original_name":"Emilio Ghione","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/8fihwz1oLxRVnVY7rCKwcQwDdCD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Caleno","credit_id":"628e8d20df86a8331afb3d18","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lia Maris","original_name":"Lia Maris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"628e8d39ed2ac2758cfa67e4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gildo Bocci","original_name":"Gildo Bocci","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/aJ9dgcPo4seK4BC5VcKjtG6Adxs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Diomede","credit_id":"628e8d4c7d5db510a656669f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Gallone","original_name":"Carmine Gallone","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/xBzyQuhLtL7YDg2V4TQhcKWQqQO.jpg","credit_id":"538aea62c3a3687146000aac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amleto Palermi","original_name":"Amleto Palermi","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":"/9mFWLNI7Q8twfXPOaoDtbW4TfjK.jpg","credit_id":"538aea76c3a368714e0009cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292973,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alfredo Panzini","original_name":"Alfredo Panzini","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61800e1ee741460060eb3c33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0143962","wikidata_id":"Q3231950","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1hgAnthR43UsCh6BzEGXnlFCQ0m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2817,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9wUAqCJgwJLp775ChC5GNdBQ5xb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1876},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xFJXNpWPJN5b7rYTXarOVJYRx12.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/jstd0350rUZyo840yfP0zEhG2x5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3347,"name":"volcano"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
