These war images taken in the Aurès-Nementchas are intended to be the basis of a dialogue between French and Algerians for peace in Algeria, by demonstrating the existence of an armed organization close to the people. Three versions of Algeria in Flames are produced: French, German and Arabic. From the end of the editing, the film circulates without any cuts throughout the world, except in France where the first screening takes place in the occupied Sorbonne in 1968.

After the declaration of independence, he founded the first Algerian Audiovisual Center.","popularity":0.4931,"poster_path":"/vo4od9ntoAQMbpdunrXoSojYbsJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1958-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Algeria in Flames","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Algeria in Flames","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Loren","original_name":"Sophia Loren","popularity":3.8588,"profile_path":"/94Kglg5dsAgOKG76230FFN7m6W3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61f0c5d415794a00e502b0c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"542d82cec3a36859de000146","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"61f0c5b16d4c97006ca4e799","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"61f0c5a19e4586009a03e112","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"61f0c597e9da69009491e208","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1190623","wikidata_id":"Q118151982","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNl3mPa5aTBEvxQYxWUDWdbGGci.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AxZVYFL74gRI7xFepwjalO5SBu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o30j8kfo0FsNNDbnGTNB5CqG8e3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKNilBPBimx7ze2dAq0CZk9sjmy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fC91SzkpHHC9ZiNFr1YANtu86Ba.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Ubtf5bMCPA9YLNve1FjRc13UeI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rDQ2H4wkVfHEXS2U1YSlaHQLP2y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nnCtP80i7KedUv8IC3vnP00m5y9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vo4od9ntoAQMbpdunrXoSojYbsJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":836,"name":"resistance"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":262858,"name":"anti-colonialism"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
