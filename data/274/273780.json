This film follows four different groups of people in today's TEHRAN. The tragic background of Moharram: The death of Imam Hossein and his 72 companions comes alive through vivid storytelling. Children of the Prophet looks at the Moharram from the perspective of average citizens of Tehran. People are careful but surprisingly open to talk about politics.
