It is a drug used by the rich and the poor legally and illegally, Mexican cartels fought over it with Colombia once associated with the brutal cocaine wars, and a source of tension between the American and Mexican borders on the people who are illicitly bringing in cocaine from one side of the border to another and will do anything to do it. So it can be surprising at times to the viewer throughout the course of the documentary special, that it was never always like this.","popularity":0.6789,"poster_path":"/hV975o5Loi63SIJvhjosvOyJek1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cocaine: History Between the Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2046078","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/CilGTMONqldwKOgcph9Csph4dJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/94gh9ITQ8EAsyk78Nyp9Jm4g8hc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hV975o5Loi63SIJvhjosvOyJek1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1601,"name":"war on drugs"},{"id":2149,"name":"drug trafficking"},{"id":1803,"name":"drug addiction"},{"id":2107,"name":"coca-cola"},{"id":2150,"name":"cocaine"},{"id":6782,"name":"addiction"},{"id":8996,"name":"medell√≠n, colombia"},{"id":10764,"name":"crack cocaine"},{"id":12396,"name":"hollywood"},{"id":13147,"name":"snake oil"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"},{"id":168811,"name":"high"},{"id":258248,"name":"pablo escobar"},{"id":299011,"name":"party drugs"},{"id":307819,"name":"stimulants"},{"id":307820,"name":"wired"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
