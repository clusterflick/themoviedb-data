Shot entirely from his point-of-view, we see what he sees, and travel through his life from his brutal childhood to the power he reclaims as an adult when he begins to feel the thrill of killing. Then he meets Anne. She's training to be a psychiatrist. Now his life alternates between the warmth and love he feels with Anne, and the horrific bloodshed he creates in her absence.","popularity":1.1689,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Bad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Dayne","original_name":"Taylor Dayne","popularity":0.3018,"profile_path":"/7E6RvfukZ1HC6QNvt9x5MMg4ywH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Beth","credit_id":"566b226bc3a36826470050e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellie Araiza","original_name":"Ellie Araiza","popularity":0.117,"profile_path":"/2X8iYhiOPrwOK51L9bm2GXm43iB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kimberly","credit_id":"566b2392c3a36836b40092b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1547834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caprice Crawford","original_name":"Caprice Crawford","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"566b23b99251415ec50054d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Makinson","original_name":"Jessica Makinson","popularity":0.1827,"profile_path":"/zX9ptpDjuBmG4Q2eALUxbabqbTa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tasha","credit_id":"566b244692514125d300062d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauley Perrette","original_name":"Pauley Perrette","popularity":3.8175,"profile_path":"/xMZGzduDxRcamkUuirbfERzRzxK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"566b2764c3a368535a0051f6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1253926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naureen Zaim","original_name":"Naureen Zaim","popularity":0.1056,"profile_path":"/rusaht2SjOEemoY94X5Jmv8y3s.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Butcher's Daughter","credit_id":"566b27aec3a3680e730003a2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1859373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Ford","original_name":"Lucas Ford","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/lsBGfkc4rihfzxP6rEyY3enbu81.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"597aa41bc3a36836e30043aa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Gomez","original_name":"Jaime Gomez","popularity":0.3019,"profile_path":"/j7pTqqYGuQTAgcP393TQBwxwPi2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"597aa63cc3a36836c0004923","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":184181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie McNeil","original_name":"Bonnie McNeil","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/l559kyFJy0HHJVQ6UPJGCXAGwX0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Patricia","credit_id":"597aa670925141369a00451b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Jermaine Heredia","original_name":"Wilson Jermaine Heredia","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/hDsrx1muxdXWl8snpZ2h6gXjKWM.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"597aa6819251413681004510","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547833,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Rackoff","original_name":"David Rackoff","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566b223592514125d30005ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547833,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Rackoff","original_name":"David Rackoff","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566b22449251415001000010","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2072126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
