As Bob the Tomato quickly points out, the jokes of the future aren't very funny because they don't make sense. Worse, technical malfunctions in the Ventrilomatic hosts actually promote emotional instability. Nonetheless, Bob admits that Larry's vision of the future contains some very cool adaptations of classic songs like Gilbert and Sullivan's fast-talking \"Modern Major General\" and Binky the Aardvark's solo performance of Mozart's The Barber of Seville. Larry's vision of the future also includes an amusing animated short about greed called \"Lunch.\" Junior Asparagus calls Bob and Larry back to the present with a final song celebrating God's unconditional love.","popularity":0.5763,"poster_path":"/kHLToPbQz69obTgJ5rMUxuJAfoi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3204,"logo_path":"/kHOVsKg00Fn4hixW7UwMwrng4sj.png","name":"Big Idea
