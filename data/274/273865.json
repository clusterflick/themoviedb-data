Pierpont Ginsburg, after declaring, in a Yiddish accent, that \"talking pictures are in their infantry,\" decides to put all of his savings into a big-budgeted musical, starring the sensation of Paris (with a bad French accent), Adore Renee, and a swishy leading man, Reginald Whitlock. Meanwhile, his daughter, Judy Ginsburg, gets involved in a romance with Ginsburg's Gentile lawyer, John Applegate. His efforts aren't helped any by the projectionist who mixes up the sound-disc reels, with the images not matching the dialogue and sound effects, during a showing for prospective film buyers and exhibitors.","popularity":0.3129,"poster_path":"/uPWFohSIuZkVelLC89Pirt4f4ra.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Talk of Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Carr","original_name":"Nat Carr","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/dCTqrvtQWcsfWoBZRIO9SY3nncP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"J.
