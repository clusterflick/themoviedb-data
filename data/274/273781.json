With editing completed by filmmaker Ken Kobland, Chuck Close lives the life and work of a man who has reinvented portraiture. Close photographs his subjects, blows up the image to gigantic proportions, divides it into a detailed grid and then uses a complex set of colors and patterning to reconstruct each face.","popularity":0.4487,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art Kaleidoscope Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chuck Close","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marion Cajori","original_name":"Marion Cajori","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546b98a19251412f610003c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2252324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Glasson","original_name":"Matt Glasson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/u7pNKU3AQhiOzKYhXPCya9K2woR.jpg","credit_id":"5c76eb349251416f3518cccd","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2401362","wikidata_id":"Q125424242","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":187212,"name":"portrait painting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
