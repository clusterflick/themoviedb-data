The individual stories are presented as a series of experimental jokes, which are at the same time an allegory of society. Lying on the border between analogue and digital processes, simplicity and complexity, light and shadow, and humor and an unpleasant shudder, the film is a report about communication problems, the unjust distribution of power, and violence.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/hFP7kbmCY2vH3k1WI7IiSJ3ix5A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Praise of Dialectics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2618362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zbyněk Baladrán","original_name":"Zbyněk Baladrán","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617352ec8ddc34002d451cf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFP7kbmCY2vH3k1WI7IiSJ3ix5A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
