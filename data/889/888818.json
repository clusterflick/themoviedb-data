It is told through stream-of-consciousness storytelling (inspired by filmmakers like Joel Potrkyus + Matt Johnson) with no real rhyme or reason. It's all over the place. But that's kinda the point. It is told with a millennial eye, but somehow universal. \"A thing that we lack as humans is showing how vulnerable we are. Everybody's so afraid of people finding the demons under their bed. And it's like, 'Just show it. Turn it into something beautiful.'\" - Noelia Towers.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Don't Even Know What I Been Through","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kentucker Audley","original_name":"Kentucker Audley","popularity":0.2056,"profile_path":"/wYGCTcopN9vuGnqbZrJc7fbpyxp.jpg","credit_id":"617423008ddc340044b4ebd4","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346473,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clay Bloodworth","original_name":"Clay Bloodworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617422f78ddc340044b4eba8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13217920","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
