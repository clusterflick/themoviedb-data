The film attempts to capture the altered state of consciousness of fine artist and writer Henri Michaux after taking mescaline and hashish. Michaux actively cooperated on the film as revealed in its prologue where Michaux comments on his psychedelic experiences. Also worth noting is the design of the film which uses Michaux's own drawings and surreal scenes evoking unusual states of consciousness.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/i4aw36ixIABXke2OuJGTKnELK5J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Images of the Visionary World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1135827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éric Duvivier","original_name":"Éric Duvivier","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61745533df86a80043703d71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i4aw36ixIABXke2OuJGTKnELK5J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1152}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
