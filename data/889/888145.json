Thanks to the access to Threema messages of Marian Kočner, a businessman under investigation in relation to the murder of the journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová, a vast corruption network within state administration and the justice system has been revealed. Disintegrating the merciless machinery including corrupt judges, rich and influential businessmen, mafia, politicians, and innocent citizens alike, is all but an easy task. Reflecting on the long-term crisis of the Slovak justice system, Zuzana Piussi’s investigative documentary asks whether the justice system with its many failures can ever be corrected.","popularity":0.0598,"poster_path":"/xRAcK7icx04z4ieeQraVB3VMJKy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117177,"logo_path":null,"name":"D1film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":154051,"logo_path":null,"name":"VIRUSfilm","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ordeal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Ordeal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zuzana Piussi","original_name":"Zuzana Piussi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6171d433d18b240044e24dcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sk","file_path":"/xRAcK7icx04z4ieeQraVB3VMJKy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2832,"iso_639_1":"sk","file_path":"/qg0hcbun2gpwDOqytvTxyh4k143.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ordeal / trailer / 25th Ji.hlava IDFF","key":"FHfJ9MJAJZI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-27T15:15:46.000Z","id":"618049bce93e95008e87bab7"}]}}}
