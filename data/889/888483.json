Ella Raidel made this penetrating ghost-town film in contemporary China, interweaving actors and ordinary people, sets and footage of the city. Aren’t the real estate agents, construction workers and investors simply playing a game? What remains of reality in a world dominated by the vagaries of capitalism? A Pile of Ghosts is a mysterious puzzle where the dividing line between fact and fiction becomes increasingly blurred. In this strange world, subjected to speculation, it actually doesn’t seem to matter anymore.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":"/A4BZk0s3ld3VXWUArLDeYiMtiwV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Pile of Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1511239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ella Raidel","original_name":"Ella Raidel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61732aa3a097dc0065eb2698","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22076760","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6OeXpwR4FMVsTvLgM1kDm6KEmn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A4BZk0s3ld3VXWUArLDeYiMtiwV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jZXgsXjEFM8L8wpSt03oRn9Th5j.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Architecture Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2021-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
