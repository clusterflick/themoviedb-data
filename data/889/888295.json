Using archival aerial photographs, microscopic videography and data mapping, this work documents how aquatic life has persisted despite intense industrialization. Earlier phases of development transformed the Port Lands into a human-built space for economic activity without regard for negative impacts on the existing environment. Evidence of this disregard persists in new so-called \"revitalization\" plans in which the water, land and inhabitants are conceived not as a living ecosystem but as data points to be optimized in a high-tech urban landscape.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/811X0CmNeVW2ErjkfuSRLgCR0qY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Port Lands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zachary Finkelstein","original_name":"Zachary Finkelstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617281f45c5cc800932cb1a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/811X0CmNeVW2ErjkfuSRLgCR0qY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Transterritorial de Cine Underground","release_date":"2021-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2021-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mirror Mountain Film Festival","release_date":"2021-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Montréal Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Interface Festival","release_date":"2020-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ENCUENTRO PARA CINÉFAGOS Festival de Cine-Arte en la Frontera","release_date":"2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
