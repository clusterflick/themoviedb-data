Transsexuality is forbidden by law in Lebanon and the transsexual community is subject to constant threat. Thus Léa is relegated to the night’s obscurity, to her work as an escort girl, and to the confines of her apartment at the Hotel Stars. A prisoner in her concrete cage, Léa refuses to be broken by the difficulty of her situation and dreams of living like others, like everyone, like those who have the “right to live”. Thus, she creates a way of taking ownership of her own life.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/cPvT1Lq6c70IlqGA6OFtFR15yWy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meanwhile in Beirut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felipe Monroy","original_name":"Felipe Monroy","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617429ff1d01910044211875","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4852302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cPvT1Lq6c70IlqGA6OFtFR15yWy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
