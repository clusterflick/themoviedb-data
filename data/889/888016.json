Through Nant, a young, first-time protester, we meet three human rights activists whose lives have been turned upside down by the coup. As the protests continue, Nant comes to understand the truth of a brutal regime that has continued to wage war against its own people for decades. Against a foreboding backdrop, Nantâ€™s political awakening regarding the plight of others in her ethnically diverse country gives hope for the future.  Beautifully augmented by poetry and art, Padauk: Myanmar Spring shows the resilience and determination of the people of Myanmar, and the sacrifices they've made.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/44t0yy958tOl1t0sbQYNIZdTp7X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Padauk: Myanmar Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3279157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rares Michael Ghilezan","original_name":"Rares Michael Ghilezan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61716e346d4c97002729b0d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3507173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanne Hallacy","original_name":"Jeanne Hallacy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/x84sGgcC7JQnhXxLahpFXe1psaJ.jpg","credit_id":"63752ccd9a6435007c743a32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/44t0yy958tOl1t0sbQYNIZdTp7X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
