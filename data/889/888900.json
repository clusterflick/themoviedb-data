When reporters come to interview him one day while in the middle of mowing his lawn and gathering chicken eggs, he introduces them to his inventions: a lawnmower, a cooling oven, and most notably his singing robot Karel, who’s managed to take over the world with his infectious songs. A film grotesque and mockumentary about the origin of a Czech music legend.","popularity":0.1459,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invention of Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2283130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pavel Klusák","original_name":"Pavel Klusák","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61744d8d33ec26008b4b4a61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marek Najbrt","original_name":"Marek Najbrt","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/xyhNcvOo9TgSr9OzSqmwSbOdYiU.jpg","credit_id":"61744d83fd7aa4009086efff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
