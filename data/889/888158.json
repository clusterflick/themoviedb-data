The term Animot was taken over from Jacque Derrida. While the French philosopher and deconstructivist uses the term to refer to everything animalistic and non-human, the film, on the other hand, uses intimate details to point out the proximity between human beings and animals. They are connected by their vulnerability, helplessness and mortality.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/7OjQVAFOrVUB5otraus2JjP8DCk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3279744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliana Moska","original_name":"Juliana Moska","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/9soYTfsTDyXfwUWrkcbAw2XfNJo.jpg","credit_id":"6171dbe56d4c9700272adf3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3160050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lukáš Červený","original_name":"Lukáš Červený","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f141736e938a006bc8e654","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2572438,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Václav Pavlíček","original_name":"Václav Pavlíček","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f1417de9da690094924174","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3259686,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Vališ","original_name":"Jan Vališ","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f14185cedac4006cc8e08f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3279744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliana Moska","original_name":"Juliana Moska","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/9soYTfsTDyXfwUWrkcbAw2XfNJo.jpg","credit_id":"61f1418d6af9dd00df47c422","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3399104,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Benjamín Kolmačka","original_name":"Benjamín Kolmačka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f14196cedac400dff27265","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3160053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominyka Adomaitytė","original_name":"Dominyka Adomaityte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f141b41ad93b0070295911","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxWmxzdFRCv6r23vXnkliCWZjz0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1264,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/7OjQVAFOrVUB5otraus2JjP8DCk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":843}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Part of \"FEINKOŠT 2022\"","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
