These women paid a steep price with long prison sentences, lost time with loved ones, and painful memories. Formerly incarcerated survivor-advocate Kim Dadou Brown, who met her wife while incarcerated, is a driving force in the passage of New York’s Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act (DVSJA), a new law meant to prevent survivors from receiving harsh prison sentences for their acts of survival. Nikki Addimando, a mother of two young children, suffered the consequences when a judge didn’t follow the law’s guidelines. Tanisha Davis, a single mother who was ripped away from her son in 2013, is hopeful the new law is her way out of a harsh prison sentence.","popularity":0.3408,"poster_path":"/gmC4fq4w9A6c6QlCmbHPubu4duO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163033,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grit Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":163034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Q&A Films","origin_country":""},{"id":42136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moxie Firecracker Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This film is made for and by survivors.
