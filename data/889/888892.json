The monograph is centered on the legendary director’s life and career after his emigration to Western Europe and to the US after 1968, which have so far received little attention. In exile, Jasný established himself as a film director (he authored over thirty cinema and TV films and documentaries), stage director, photographer, and film studies lecturer. The first part will be followed by the screening of Jasný’s documentary Why Havel? co-produced by himself and Miloš Forman in Canada and Czechoslovakia in 1991. As remarkable as this reflection of the paradoxical transformation of a dissident into a president in the carnival-like atmosphere of the euphoric post-revolution period with the first question marks already appearing may be, it did not meet the expectations of the head of state.","popularity":0.3444,"poster_path":"/6SfVxIMeUWKvmZBCdHZXogF7CTx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Havel?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Václav Havel","original_name":"Václav Havel","popularity":0.2566,"profile_path":"/AjP5JnL8f8st6jtmrHJapg0QINK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Václav Havel","credit_id":"627c390e6d1bb2009de6bf9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miloš Forman","original_name":"Miloš Forman","popularity":0.747,"profile_path":"/O2Crxh0l3u1mxHvjA6003gEpi7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"voice","credit_id":"627d56e620e6a513bd9014bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1996619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Havlová","original_name":"Olga Havlová","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Olga Havlová","credit_id":"627d56f8f6596f16bc6aee74","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximilian Schell","original_name":"Maximilian Schell","popularity":0.4557,"profile_path":"/6WLkJ6Lj8bhO3MdV8EBx41ZWjbL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"627d5733168ea3009c419006","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":52340,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sylvain Brault","original_name":"Sylvain Brault","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627d567ffd140b00acbf4483","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223731,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jaroslav Kučera","original_name":"Jaroslav Kučera","popularity":0.1192,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627d569edfe31d0050720e51","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vojtěch Jasný","original_name":"Vojtěch Jasný","popularity":0.2184,"profile_path":"/cXz5807HlHo5cIiWuaIH4ixlV29.jpg","credit_id":"627d55a33af929004f364c73","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vojtěch Jasný","original_name":"Vojtěch Jasný","popularity":0.2184,"profile_path":"/cXz5807HlHo5cIiWuaIH4ixlV29.jpg","credit_id":"61744884894ed6008e45e770","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933561,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rock Demers","original_name":"Rock Demers","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/etUMbgxhN5hSZw0xCxBjeM8GOlG.jpg","credit_id":"66a662f92ba168e7097462c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bzU9Cq2TaIphLYABkBUW15DEsNJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6SfVxIMeUWKvmZBCdHZXogF7CTx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
