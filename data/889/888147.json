Their families were brought to the Czech Republic by different circumstances and each of them has different ideas about their own future. While eighteen-year-old Andriy, an ambitious boxer, wants to become independent as soon as possible, and Grecia, an artistically gifted student, would like to get into an art high school, Linda is still not sure what she wants to do with her education and career. The time-lapse documentary engagingly captures an important stage in the lives of young people for whom not only the language barrier, but also the long-term lockdown due to the coronavirus epidemic is an obstacle.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One-room School","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Hátle","original_name":"Petr Hátle","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/51ffPaNCF6UvxdKDGmv2Wve4mKy.jpg","credit_id":"6171d52f90fca3002ca84e55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1609865,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Prokop Souček","original_name":"Prokop Souček","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f92591bb1057006daaabf4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Hátle","original_name":"Petr Hátle","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/51ffPaNCF6UvxdKDGmv2Wve4mKy.jpg","credit_id":"61f925880c4c1601097d1374","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1877474,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mariana Kozáková","original_name":"Mariana Kozáková","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f9259a5f2db100440c12b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2568298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vojtěch Knot","original_name":"Vojtěch Knot","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f925a2eee18600cd399cfb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mifBGsjDcOlJ59Cf8XD8P9qLMNZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10873,"name":"school"},{"id":191706,"name":"citizen"},{"id":249799,"name":"study"},{"id":266032,"name":"strangers"},{"id":294318,"name":"learning"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
