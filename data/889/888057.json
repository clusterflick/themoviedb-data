The heart of the show is an ABC television special featuring live performances of \"Toxic,\" \"Breathe on Me,\" and \"I'm a Slave 4 U.\" A fun highlight is Spears's hip-hop collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins on \"(I Got That) Boom Boom,\" one of the few numbers in the star's stage repertoire with a little room for spontaneity. Between songs one finds Spears gushing over her grandfather, praising her entourage, describing the emotional toll of being in the public eye, and writing songs.","popularity":3.2135,"poster_path":"/eSJf5AuJUGR7fSqe6Ebz5T74bLU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
