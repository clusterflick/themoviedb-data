The film evokes different types of Stalin worship, from the individual to the collective one, and depicts a highly heterogeneous set of exhibits at a French exhibition in tribute to Stalin. Banned for commercial and non-commercial distribution in France, the film won the Best Short Film Screenplay award at the 1950 Karlovy Vary Film Festival.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man We Love the Most","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53771,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Victoria Mercanton","original_name":"Victoria Mercanton","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61744930b6c264002a688cdc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
