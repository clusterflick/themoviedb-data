Many inspirations have informed this project, such as the concept of the cyborg by Donna J. Haraway, Hans Bellmer's drawings, Greek Mythology as well as an underlying reflexion on self portrait and the place of the body in the digital world. Captive within the limitations of their own subjectivities, these cyborg/goddesses embody the concept of monade, where each individual is a fragmented mirror of a larger reality.\"","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/5dVP1sPdE8gyp18rwrRNR8hK4By.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monade IV","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1517759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Ratté","original_name":"Sabrina Ratté","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/zz3RPbpjeuNAD9bNoDr943xlr3h.jpg","credit_id":"61740bb1cadb6b0062d6ea1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":917,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5dVP1sPdE8gyp18rwrRNR8hK4By.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":611}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
