Inspired by Duchampian tradition, Pedro and João filmed a short chronicle of curved means of transportation in the tropics. Overlaying directly on the negative (camera editing) the feat of paradoxically freezing a moving bicycle wheel, a car wheel and anamorphic depiction of tire, João and Pedro constate that for that to happen everything else must be perceived as a gyroscope.","popularity":0.0472,"poster_path":"/9Vl5P2n69QGjArwsG1z2A3XMDkU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wheels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Maria Gusmão","original_name":"João Maria Gusmão","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lDQA8bP7xW1IZx8X9gYYvVn3faT.jpg","credit_id":"6171770a0d5d85004371ab2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Paiva","original_name":"Pedro Paiva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lDQA8bP7xW1IZx8X9gYYvVn3faT.jpg","credit_id":"6171771b5c5cc80065ba9855","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Vl5P2n69QGjArwsG1z2A3XMDkU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ST","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
