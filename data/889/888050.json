It is the effort to expose the heart through absence. Allowing the image to sharpen the senses to a past that still pulses in the present. Where touching the body is impossible, records and documents undress from their formality, and assume the poetic function of recovering gestures, to draw new possibilities. 'Breath' is a snippet, it is the desire of hugging, of looking in the eyes, while relentlessly searching for air.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kVRSIlTdauidFbLpOox0bEuCZdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Doc","title":"Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14939698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kVRSIlTdauidFbLpOox0bEuCZdn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
