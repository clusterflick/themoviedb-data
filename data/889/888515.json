He doesn't have much except a big house left by his parents. He is sick of seeing his country crumble before him. He has one sincere dream---that is to diminish the high crime rate of Afghanistan. Sameer is dyslexic so he cannot learn. He tries to make up for it by taking up martial arts, but lacks the focus to excel at it. One day, he comes across an old ancient necklace in an old run-down castle. He soon discovers that the necklace gives him the power of time. Whenever he or other civilians are in danger, Sameer uses the necklace to slow down the passage of time, providing him vast amount of time to devise a way of out danger. He uses the powers of the necklace to defeat high-profile mobsters of Afghanistan, thus making some powerful enemies.","popularity":0.1605,"poster_path":"/1jnT9nzMbA6U7FHG2bvj72s241h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joint Task Force Films","origin_country":""},{"id":146361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Makama Films","origin_country":""},{"id":163059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shams Media Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"2016-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faceless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3074825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Humayoon Shams Khan","original_name":"Humayoon Shams Khan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sameer","credit_id":"6173424dcadb6b008af134c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rahmatullah Khostai","original_name":"Rahmatullah Khostai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ali","credit_id":"617342605294e7002a386dfc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farahnaz Nawabi","original_name":"Farahnaz Nawabi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"6173426f6d4c9700272e2eed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farzana Nawabi","original_name":"Farzana Nawabi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nilofar","credit_id":"617342876d4c9700272e2f32","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abrar Shams Khan","original_name":"Abrar Shams Khan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nasir","credit_id":"6173429aabdec0008f5c26ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nasima Nawabi","original_name":"Nasima Nawabi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Maria's mother","credit_id":"617342bbb3316b006575ffa2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shahwali Nawabi","original_name":"Shahwali Nawabi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Maria's father","credit_id":"617342cb90fca3008b0f8c4e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asad Tajzal","original_name":"Asad Tajzal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Rahman","credit_id":"617342dd5294e7002a386fce","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2838383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Akbar Akbar Kamal","original_name":"Ali Akbar Akbar Kamal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617343126d4c9700272e30b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2838383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Akbar Akbar Kamal","original_name":"Ali Akbar Akbar Kamal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617343051d01910091acc0d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6255606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1334,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1jnT9nzMbA6U7FHG2bvj72s241h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9715,"name":"superhero"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
