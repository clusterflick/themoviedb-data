Thus, the opportunity to make a film for Sandoz was given to Edd Dundas, American underground filmmaker, who created a psychological study of a young man whom a voice of a divine apparition or a demon drives to committing the radical act of assassination. The film was shot in Japan and fuses Japanese symbols with a universal portrayal of the harrowed inner world of the main protagonist. Dundas relates the complex subject matter mostly using atmospheric photography and strong sound design.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Burning Ear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3281709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edd Dundas","original_name":"Edd Dundas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617449cf5bce9e008db21a65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
