This well-known Prague prominent, who in his heyday famously lived on Nerudova Street, is noted for having led a double life: serving as an informant and frequent collaborator for the state police while also maintaining his position as an influential personality in the Czechoslovak underground. His legacy still carries with it a number of ambiguities, controversies, and prejudices. Some still demand he be condemned for his “ratting on the righteous.” Others stress the importance of his philosophical work, despite his seditious existence. The image of Egon Bondy in this documentary gives a playful nod to this ambivalent interpretation. Creators are frequently attracted to his powerful personality and still work to understand his complex worldview.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballet on a Paraphrenic Topic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1135827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éric Duvivier","original_name":"Éric Duvivier","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617456195bce9e00439ba87e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
