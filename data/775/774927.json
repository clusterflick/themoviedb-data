May Ayim was one of the founders of the Black German Movement, and her research on the history and present situation of Afro-Germans, but also her political poetry, made her known in Germany and in other countries. May Ayim wrote in the tradition of oral poetry and felt a strong connection to other Black poets of the diaspora. Poetry gave her an opportunity to confront the white German society with its own prejudices. The film shows the author in performances in South Africa and in Germany.  Interviews and poems reveal the search for identity, how and why the term Afro-German was introduced and how a young Black woman experienced the German unification. May Ayim lived from 1960 to 1996.  In Berlin, a street which had the name of a colonialist was renamed in 2010 after May Ayim.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/lI4pcnQgdNzTGNjVnM4fcZDxTBO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope In My Heart – The May Ayim Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2668002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May Ayim","original_name":"May Ayim","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fd3cde7d19a33003e3be6fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Härtling","original_name":"Sabine Härtling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5fd3ce96efd3c20041cc5841","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890007,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ekpenyong Ani","original_name":"Ekpenyong Ani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3cf020859b4003ef067e4","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dagmar Schultz","original_name":"Dagmar Schultz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3cf4a3009aa003ff4ea21","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Binder","original_name":"Maria Binder","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ce013cd12c003fe41f09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890007,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ekpenyong Ani","original_name":"Ekpenyong Ani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ceb7d19a33003d3be168","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600162,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ika Hügel-Marshall","original_name":"Ika Hügel-Marshall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3cec76cf3d50043c16249","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dagmar Schultz","original_name":"Dagmar Schultz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3cef3eec4f300411d5200","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890014,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Storme Webber","original_name":"Storme Webber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3cfb32f7915003f3baa1e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Binder","original_name":"Maria Binder","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ce10efd3c2003ecc54f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Binder","original_name":"Maria Binder","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ce46eec4f3003f1d4e93","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890002,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Silke Betscher","original_name":"Silke Betscher","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ce35a0b6b50040fab4ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Binder","original_name":"Maria Binder","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3cf55a0b6b50041fab30b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890018,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mzwakhe Mbuli","original_name":"Mzwakhe Mbuli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3d00dcca7de00423f32e4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1279,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lI4pcnQgdNzTGNjVnM4fcZDxTBO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":896},{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wdzBZxvJdNL1QxJ4RFE7ztZ0bxK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"German\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"German\"}","note":"","release_date":"1997-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
