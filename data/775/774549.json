More than a million people came to line the streets of London on the freezing day in late January to pay their respects as his coffin was taken from the lying-in-state at Westminster to St Paul's Cathedral. Millions more watched the state funeral on television. Churchill was the only commoner in the twentieth century to receive the honour of such a magnificent ceremony.","popularity":0.5968,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":34917,"logo_path":"/rCmOrLlCmu09wfv80DAsxofvoX2.png","name":"Blakeway Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Churchill: The Nation's Farewell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":183802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Paxman","original_name":"Jeremy Paxman","popularity":0.1875,"profile_path":"/1yJWard8QcZbV5yPQ3XGVNwvrNg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5fd1f3d4d7cd06003d7ec6c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":183802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Paxman","original_name":"Jeremy Paxman","popularity":0.1875,"profile_path":"/1yJWard8QcZbV5yPQ3XGVNwvrNg.jpg","credit_id":"5fd1f3f7f92532003ea8e1c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hayes Fisher","original_name":"John Hayes Fisher","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1f420d18fb90040fa4089","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hayes Fisher","original_name":"John Hayes Fisher","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1f440d18fb90040fa4098","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4407108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":243503,"name":"winston churchill"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
