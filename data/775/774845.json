More specifically it's an example of a \"flicker film\". Composed of both still photographs and live footage, Excavation employs extremely short-shot juxtapositions to  create disorienting collisions of imagery.   For Cagle, this film symbolized a personal exploration of, in his words, “techniques and ideas that have accumulated over the years, but had been without expression for one reason or another.” A dynamic visualization of his thoughts, it “excavates” both the private workings of his inner world, and also the material components of filmmaking.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/f0VMAEIKHIgHQn5Td1HM9k7oj14.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excavation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2886181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cagle","original_name":"James Cagle","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nU4ARUjJN9ottncgqItbzGAMiUz.jpg","credit_id":"5fd36b7acee481003fe14f24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2886181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cagle","original_name":"James Cagle","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nU4ARUjJN9ottncgqItbzGAMiUz.jpg","credit_id":"5fd36b89880c9200435067ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f0VMAEIKHIgHQn5Td1HM9k7oj14.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eD4NqEHaaeUwPvhxzlRuao6hQTU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
