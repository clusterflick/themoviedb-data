And in order to face the increasing poverty of the people, politicians who have abandoned them are said to have promulgated an Article 15 proclaiming: \"Citizens, get out of the mess yourselves!\" But as the social situation disintegrated even more, a second Article 15 was apparently added and immediately adopted: \"Citizens get out of the mess all over again!\" Article 15A expresses the loser's triumphant laughter. In this contemporary fable, three security guards reveal their lowly nature while talking leisurely in the midday heat about public service, corruption, and back pay.","popularity":0.0755,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Article 15A","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281231,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Michel Humeau","original_name":"Jean-Michel Humeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e440f990fca3007b04c0e0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3912232,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adéchoubou N'Diagne","original_name":"Adéchoubou N'Diagne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e440e82e2b2c00a0899ed7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72738,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Didier Ranz","original_name":"Didier Ranz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e4410690fca300fac8cb10","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Balufu Bakupa-Kanyinda","original_name":"Balufu Bakupa-Kanyinda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd35436f056d5003d630f7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256617","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
