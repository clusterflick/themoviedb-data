The land of Stanley Cup winners and world champions. However, the stellar generation is over and there are no successors. The home World Cup 2019 brought new hope. The matches of the Slovak national team were given to Košice for the first time, and for the East it was a unique chance to ignite passion in the new generation of fans. The film maps four months before the start of the championships in the lives of two people. World champion from 2002 Ladislav Nagy, who has pursued a career because of the World Cup and wants to say goodbye to it at home in Košice. And Jonáš Pahuli, a beginning hockey player, for whom the championship is a unique chance to see big hockey live and, thanks to that, to kick their own career.","popularity":0.0837,"poster_path":"/bsERNqZ9vlE8j050yodLzDymFLv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Slovakia is a hockey nation.
