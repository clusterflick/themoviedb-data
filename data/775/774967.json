William M. Thomas, a medical surgeon, is a man of questionable faith and principles, until he hears the audible voice of God. The near death experience and commanding voice of The Almighty shakes William to his spiritual core. What begins as a righteous quest for American freedom and human redemption, ultimately transforms the traveling doctor into the most notorious abolitionist of Ante-Bellum America. His wife, the most affluent and powerful woman in the New World, covers her husbands tracks, until one day he goes too far. Now all are left to choose between life or death; security or sacrifice; passivity or justice; faith or fear.","popularity":0.044,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Underground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10765626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
