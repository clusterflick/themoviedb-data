The theatre is more than merely his occupation, for he not only works there but also spends all of his time in it. The film depicts his routine and the rehearsal process up until the premiere, and provokes a dialogue using the four actors who have all played Hamlet in the different productions. Kroders’s life and the lives of the actors tell the history of Latvia and the fates of different generations.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":"/lUCIQD6QpjOTtobjXRDDRmhAJhv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latvijas Kultūras akadēmija","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":145407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nomadi","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2009-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fifth Hamlet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oļgerts Kroders","original_name":"Oļģerts Kroders","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/lkyBbKFTlMcD4xC42aGbuIMihUW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fd326a22d531a004032fa05","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Burāne","original_name":"Krista Burāne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2Nw1VgLZSlr166hpzSpG9b8eUC2.jpg","credit_id":"5fd32613880c9200424ff34b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mārtiņš Eihe","original_name":"Mārtiņš Eihe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8BoBxI9j9I4p6l4OCljw7spq2ra.jpg","credit_id":"5fd32680880c92004350098d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mārtiņš Eihe","original_name":"Mārtiņš Eihe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8BoBxI9j9I4p6l4OCljw7spq2ra.jpg","credit_id":"5fd3262befe37c0041e5a704","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877766,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Inese Apse","original_name":"Inese Apse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3263f848eb90040dd6d12","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Burāne","original_name":"Krista Burāne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2Nw1VgLZSlr166hpzSpG9b8eUC2.jpg","credit_id":"5fd32606848eb9003fdd7322","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Burāne","original_name":"Krista Burāne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2Nw1VgLZSlr166hpzSpG9b8eUC2.jpg","credit_id":"5fd325ee55c1f40040a91a51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889427,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Haralds Matulis","original_name":"Haralds Matulis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3266df056d5003d62d999","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Burāne","original_name":"Krista Burāne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2Nw1VgLZSlr166hpzSpG9b8eUC2.jpg","credit_id":"5fd325fa848eb9003fdd731b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889426,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Egons Kronbergs","original_name":"Egons Kronbergs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd32656091e620041ef4d5c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4641716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lUCIQD6QpjOTtobjXRDDRmhAJhv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
