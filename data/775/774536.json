The only one she's interested in is a cornball practical joker in an old fashioned straw hat, who returns her affection with embarrassing dirty tricks. When she's in an egg laying competition, he slips her some gum that causes her to lay a bursting, gooey balloon, and he tricks her into eating hot pepper-laced ice cream. She finally becomes the belle of the affair when her pepper-infused smooching is a hit at the kissing booth.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wallflower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Harrison","original_name":"Ben Harrison","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a14cc80cb33500935fe82a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0153638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
