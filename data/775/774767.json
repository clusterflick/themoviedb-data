On the way, her father taught her to drive. Ramila had been suffering from diarrhea and relieved herself in the wild many times on the way. However, the two chatted and joked, in a very happy atmosphere, and the daughter expressed the hope that her father would find another life spouse.  After a while, they arrived at their destination, an orchard run by Hurxide. In the orchard, Ramila felt that Lokman was having an affair with Hurxide , who turned out to be her father's girlfriend to-be. However, Ramila, who had hoped her father would remarry, felt a little disappointed.  On the way back, Ramila did not want to sit on her father’s right to fasten the safety belt on the excuse of hot weather. Lokman sensed his daughter's mood. Just at this time, Lokman picked up a wild rooster on the road and brought it to his daughter.  Night was coming, the car was driving forward, just like the endless life.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/jqrwxoV3QQSbApY3esq5DW0qQbo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Uighur","iso_639_1":"ug","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fruit Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2547508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emetjan Memet","original_name":"Emetjan Memet","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd2dfbd2811a10040b41902","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jqrwxoV3QQSbApY3esq5DW0qQbo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beijing International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2020-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
