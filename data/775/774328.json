It's unusual in that they used an early form of color, 'Sennett Color', a two-color process typical of the era (similar to Cinecolor and Two-Color Technicolor). As far as the film goes, it consists of three folks looking at birds at the newly opened California Aviaries Bird Park on Catalina Island.","popularity":0.1201,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Beebe","original_name":"Marjorie Beebe","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/kkv8TjvluOItjoOebos216R6xY2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Baron's Sweetheart","credit_id":"5fd0f9a30ce1bc003ff12294","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Alberni","original_name":"Luis Alberni","popularity":0.1843,"profile_path":"/l9T44h8op9ZT3Xx0RrhAzT6jaMc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Baron","credit_id":"5fd0f9c3d18fb9003ff84376","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Eastman","original_name":"Frank Eastman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Tour Guide","credit_id":"5fd0f9ede9c0dc003d37b9fd","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0316694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
