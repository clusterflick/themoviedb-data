For Deanna, who flew in from Australia with her 70-year-old mother, talking about her diagnosis is a daily job throughout her life. She is an example for the American Sean, who prepared for the \"coming out\" long and carefully. Seam is sure that his parents in an Indonesian village will hardly ever know about his participation in the Open Faces team in distant Kazan. Zhandos, a young doctor from Kazakhstan, only worries about how the news will affect his mother.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/eZWYpFnm4Fpt9yMW3ZCtRRSrJzz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not My Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Ne moya istoriya","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2276624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alena Alenkina","original_name":"Alena Alenkina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd249a88e87020043d82b59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2276624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alena Alenkina","original_name":"Alena Alenkina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24a2c8e87020041d788ed","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2888761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladislava Zhukovskaya","original_name":"Vladislava Zhukovskaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24a0b22931a003e6d0485","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2888760,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrey Zlobin","original_name":"Andrey Zlobin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd249bf22931a003f6d0799","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2888763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasiya Ivanova","original_name":"Anastasiya Ivanova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24a411089ba003fd22ae7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2276624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alena Alenkina","original_name":"Alena Alenkina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd249aef92532003daa546c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2247018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Karelina","original_name":"Александра Карелина","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd249e11bf266004004cd57","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1997349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yuliya Shirokova","original_name":"Yuliya Shirokova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24b2a325a51003d742664","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2711243,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Evgeny Plank","original_name":"Evgeny Plank","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24afbe9c0dc003f39dd14","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2888766,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anastasiya Kunets","original_name":"Anastasiya Kunets","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24b4960c751003e259ead","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2888764,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandr Shirmanov","original_name":"Alexandr Shirmanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24ac7d7cd06003f7fb309","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/eZWYpFnm4Fpt9yMW3ZCtRRSrJzz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Eight Women International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
