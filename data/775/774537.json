His nemesis the mouse responds to this by looting the refrigerator the minute she's gone, spilling a turkey dinner onto the floor. The cat is hesitant to go into the room, but soon is in full chase, with the mouse trapping into the sink and and electric mixer, eventually zapping him with a massager so he glides into the turkey, and is caught by his owner.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kitty Gets the Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0148382","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
