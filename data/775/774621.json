The approach she tries is to imagine a listener removed in time and space. Her speech, however, lapses into musings on aging, illness and sexuality. A different cut of the monologue will be a part of a longer film entitled Kafka for Kids, but it can be experienced as an autonomous work.","popularity":0.2357,"poster_path":"/pE4YCgnxALR9OdMRA7CjUF2xnU8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Explaining the Law to Kwame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":657997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hani Furstenberg","original_name":"Hani Furstenberg","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/iAMfKbyQzUyfdUwHjTLTTEIfV4O.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fd23aedd18fb90040faa2d5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roee Rosen","original_name":"Roee Rosen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iafIF5mGOs4PY970AiU1d9E5vZ.jpg","credit_id":"61f32aa6df294500434ddba0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roee Rosen","original_name":"Roee Rosen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iafIF5mGOs4PY970AiU1d9E5vZ.jpg","credit_id":"61f32ac05f2db1011a42bf10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roee Rosen","original_name":"Roee Rosen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iafIF5mGOs4PY970AiU1d9E5vZ.jpg","credit_id":"5fd23865d18fb9003ef9fd5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888683,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Rodoy","original_name":"David Rodoy","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd23934f92532003daa333b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12915182","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pE4YCgnxALR9OdMRA7CjUF2xnU8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDMarseille","release_date":"2020-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FICUNAM 11","release_date":"2021-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
