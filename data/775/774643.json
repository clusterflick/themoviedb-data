This African country lives under one of the longest-lived dictatorships in the world, Teodoro Obiang, a military man trained in Zaragoza. His regime strongly represses all freedoms, including sexual ones. Franco Spanish laws are still in force in the country, such as the «public scandal». It is not possible to protest on the street and the only LGTB organization in the country has not been able to legalize itself. In addition, the country’s Parliament is studying hardening the current penal code. To denounce the situation, the group «We are part of the world» has collected the voices of the community in a documentary that pays tribute to Fidel Lemoy, one of its best-known faces, who disappeared last year.","popularity":0.1723,"poster_path":"/mzf2C04SkN8YPx8adKUj4RUJwB0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GQ","name":"Equatorial Guinea"}],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fidel Lemoy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trifonia Melibea Obono","original_name":"Trifonia Melibea Obono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd24d258e87020043d82fac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Monsuy Ndong Andeme","original_name":"Rubén Monsuy Ndong Andeme","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/u9aPrQSj0NWotsbvBpejMhDVk48.jpg","credit_id":"5fd249318e8702003fd7cb2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":793,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ebMLX7YPe5WsRDlVzEhfqRl03PS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1410}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":793,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mzf2C04SkN8YPx8adKUj4RUJwB0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":195624,"name":"black lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
