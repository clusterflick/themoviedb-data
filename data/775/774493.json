A neighboring pig farmer named Don Inocente refuses to join their cause in the name of neutrality. In disguise, the cattle rustlers befriend Don Inocente, rob him of his pigs, and then use his farm as a means to sneak into the undefended side of Burrito and Manolin’s ranch. Once again, Burrito and Manolin stop the villians and come to the rescue of the unsuspecting neutral character. In this clip, Lios and Chente spy on their intended victim, Don Inocente.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dibujos Animados, S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":79918,"logo_path":"/aRdHimsFTCuxhzQ0yG4yohKOxQk.png","name":"United States Information Agency (USIA)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rustlers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Rustlers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888346,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joaquin Camacho","original_name":"Joaquin Camacho","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4fb0ce1bc003ef1fe73","department":"Production","job":"Finance"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888298,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ernesto Terrazas","original_name":"Ernesto Terrazas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4a58e87020043d789c7","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888347,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Miguel Arellano","original_name":"Miguel Arellano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c52b0ce1bc003ff26f11","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888320,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Miguel Garcia","original_name":"Miguel Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c50ec7a7e0003f042563","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1781041,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Fernando Castro","original_name":"Fernando Castro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c51e325a51003a734ece","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888342,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ernesto Alvarez","original_name":"Ernesto Alvarez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4c71d1bf40040cb6648","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888368,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Arnulfo Rivera","original_name":"Arnulfo Rivera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c53e0f2fbd003b773df7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888367,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Octayio Ponce","original_name":"Octayio Ponce","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4ef2ceb53003fef1a21","department":"Production","job":"Finance"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799517,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tom McDonald","original_name":"Tom McDonald","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4860f2fbd003d7768dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888314,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Carlos Sandoval","original_name":"Carlos Sandoval","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4920f2fbd003d7768e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888324,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luis Strempler","original_name":"Luis Strempler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4d21d1bf40040cb664b","department":"Production","job":"Finance"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888319,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Eduardo Rodriguez","original_name":"Eduardo Rodriguez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c5541d1bf40040cb66fa","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888326,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jose Luis Tamayo","original_name":"Jose Luis Tamayo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c4b6c7a7e0004203e685","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888314,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Carlos Sandoval","original_name":"Carlos Sandoval","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c57ff9183a004165d8ca","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888316,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ignacio Renteria","original_name":"Ignacio Renteria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1c5b6f9183a004065d8a4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard K.
