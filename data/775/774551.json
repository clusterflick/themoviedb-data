The actor, himself a pilot, takes to the skies to retrace the route of the 1943 raid by 617 Squadron which used bouncing bombs to destroy German dams. He sheds new light on the story as he separates the fact from the myth behind this tale of courage and ingenuity. Using the 1955 movie The Dam Busters as a vehicle to deconstruct the raid, he tries to piece together a picture of perhaps the most daring attack in the history of aviation warfare.","popularity":0.7129,"poster_path":"/iV3nt5UhJ1TjhZ6OSBwxMfUTX7G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dam Busters Declassified","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Shaw","original_name":"Martin Shaw","popularity":0.6554,"profile_path":"/p4EBXNz2nLQGHoAfsTrieqLX4nn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fd1f8864df291003ed07e92","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888459,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Wichelow","original_name":"Sam Wichelow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1f8bb2ceb530042eeeb39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888460,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Cundall","original_name":"Ian Cundall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1f8fa798c940041c3a5fe","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986941,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicola Addyman","original_name":"Nicola Addyman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd1f92c798c94003fc2cd75","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1834220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Z1f4rDD1VdEBuSQ5ERbvfCTTRj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iV3nt5UhJ1TjhZ6OSBwxMfUTX7G.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33638,"name":"warfare"},{"id":250579,"name":"aviation history"},{"id":250582,"name":"military aviation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
