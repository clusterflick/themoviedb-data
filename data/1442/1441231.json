When we meet forty-eight-year-old Colin, the main character of the film, he is walking under the flyover of a motorway. He is on foot while those who play the game by society's rules whizz by a few feet above his head at the driving wheels of their Cadillacs. He dropped out long ago and lives alone forgotten by his family. He used to be a junkie and an alcoholic, now he is a marginal and develops analytical and self-justifying arguments which sometimes turn into a flow of jumbled words. Cumming introduces us to the everyday realities of this character with honesty.","popularity":0.0616,"poster_path":"/kTAqHFsnZaukdPI3cVsVNrKcBC1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erratic Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Harvey","original_name":"Gerald Harvey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gerry","credit_id":"67c1dc0ba7af2713c3a23657","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5275342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Kane","original_name":"Colin Kane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Colin","credit_id":"67c1dc23a7af2713c3a2369b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Donigan","credit_id":"67c1dc2fa7af2713c3a236a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Lamarche","original_name":"Pierre Lamarche","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pierre","credit_id":"67c1dc7aa7af2713c3a236fe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5275345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Albanese","original_name":"Carlo Albanese","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Carlo","credit_id":"67c1dc8ac67b368ba63590d6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67c1dc97a1ddf53f4dc8ddc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67c1dce0ab2d8b81ccc8f96c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":872,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kTAqHFsnZaukdPI3cVsVNrKcBC1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
