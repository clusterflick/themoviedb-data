It tells the story of the inhabitants of a desolate coastline, trapped between a desertified interior and an unnamed coast. Following, the first-person voiceover of its protagonist Lawrence, the story unfolds through a sequence of striking documentary scenes, shot in inland and coastal Israel and Palestine. While the landscapes and sites Russo has gathered are real – places of rusting industry, of abandoned habitation and the bizarre, almost extraterrestrial salt formations of the Dead Sea – the narration transforms these into the ruins of an entire society, doomed to a world in which it has ceased to rain.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sinkholes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2620714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karen Russo","original_name":"Karen Russo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c353a179656ddf5a6e031b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
