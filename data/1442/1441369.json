One stork has a relatively safe trip to deliver her baby, while the other faces significant dangers, risking her life; each obstacle serves as a metaphor for various forms of violence or obstetric complications. Throughout her journey, the protagonist visually deconstructs herself, just as she does the idealization of motherhood. A layer of reality begins to take over the screen through experimental manual painting. Upon reaching the maternity ward, the stark difference between the two storks becomes clear: the one who barely survived is the one delivering a Black baby.","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":"/4o4nutO3xPTL152rufmKvMVvHuT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258092,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Youth","origin_country":""},{"id":258096,"logo_path":null,"name":"COLOSSAL","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Impossible Journey","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5275939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"YUCA","original_name":"YUCA","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c24054bc6935a001a27d29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.783,"height":1690,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pMBlk3Or2s48AR9rlhEKnp1Xkf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3014},{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p7Cdr9xjPTFvDZ967Dg13GX64T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2998},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3UZmkrCSmC5Y4uQpB8GTlQUDZn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3018},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9krzCMKcTwbYusPJzs14oZ9kH7u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7eYG4u9adMgKEIHFfirnPxj8yj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1694,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oJg4ZtGIHzSX16b5XqlUiIwwPdY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3014}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4o4nutO3xPTL152rufmKvMVvHuT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1198,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sYahLyaD96pA2N7MnxIpPUOYus5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162701,"name":"racial prejudice"},{"id":215942,"name":"real facts"},{"id":273522,"name":"animated painting"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"},{"id":336583,"name":"frame by frame animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
