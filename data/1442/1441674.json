The film delves into the heart of this annual event, where thousands gather in the wilderness to practice anarchy and hippie spirituality. The main event is an elaborate prayer for peace on July 4th, which contrasts sharply with the challenges faced by the community when federal agents intervene, using pepper spray projectiles in the children's area. The documentary explores themes of peace, community, and resilience in the face of adversity, as participants frequently express their love and unity with chants of \"we love you\" and \"we love you more.\" Through this lens, the film offers a glimpse into the Rainbow Family's unique culture and their pursuit of harmony with nature and each other.","popularity":0.1091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"WE LOVE YOU","title":"We Love You","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Geri Russell","original_name":"Patricia Geri Russell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67c3360cc2e633755b6def7e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076626,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Kalafer","original_name":"Jonathan Kalafer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c335b8b86c7903d33f6be0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1377816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":325824,"name":"hopeful"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
