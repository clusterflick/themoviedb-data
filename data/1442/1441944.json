The director Günter Krämer paid particular attention to the interpersonal component of the opera accentuating the conflict-ridden king's loss of power as the core. His Nabucco is the tragedy of a mighty ruler. Leo Nucci, the baritone well known at all the great opera houses of the world, is Nabucco. After experiencing him at the Vienna State Opera, a critic wrote of his \"fascinating timbre\" and \"intense and plausible acting\". Maria Guleghina, who performs Abigaille, is one of the most celebrated and acclaimed sopranos of the world. She has been described as \"Russian soprano with Verdi flowing through her veins\". Supported by a distinguished cast (Marina Domashenko, Miroslav Dvorský, Giacomo Prestia) this Nabucco is a must for opera lovers.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/xBRF690OwzLexG3nSNr1g38MX9c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi: Nabucco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Nucci","original_name":"Leo Nucci","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/fre6T3D9ba2DwpOz3mxnetRr8JW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nabucco","credit_id":"67c3ac798ac38c7b854e0bb4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":282592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Guleghina","original_name":"Maria Guleghina","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/t1lyRp8qcYoSPeQUTiYMRxSK2tL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Abigail","credit_id":"67c3ac956466bd8ed24e086f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284199,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabio Luisi","original_name":"Fabio Luisi","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/oleLkdfMGLmuQ4VBcyVtdubIKVi.jpg","credit_id":"67c3acad49bb8758bab47f23","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Günter Krämer","original_name":"Günter Krämer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3acd8a5e1e358c44af5b2","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xBRF690OwzLexG3nSNr1g38MX9c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
