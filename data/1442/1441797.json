As they come together and grow apart, the floating, recombined bodies seek to coexist between life and death. Featuring members of my family, this film explores the traces of the memories that we carry within us, and that, ghost-like, prolong our lives outside of ourselves.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immortals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myriam Jacob-Allard","original_name":"Myriam Jacob-Allard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c35bad6e768090076e018b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
