Sadowski parallels his own morning routine's disorientation and reconnection with how ancient humans might have perceived their existence in caves. The cave symbolizes the continuity of consciousness through time. The video is crafted through a meticulous process: Sadowski records himself with green-screen technology, edits the frames using 3D animation software to create a cave interior, and then uses laser-cut physical representations reanimated through stop-motion. This work reflects on waking up as a timeless, universal moment, linking past and present, and inviting viewers to contemplate the nature of consciousness.","popularity":0.0787,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cave Carved in the Shape of a Waking Person","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5277253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mateusz Sadowski","original_name":"Mateusz Sadowski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c34d1d360ca9d12c66b9c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
