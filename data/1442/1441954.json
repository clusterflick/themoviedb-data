The operatic re-telling of this much loved fairy-tale centres on Cinderella's honesty and integrity, and on her willingness to forgive others, and to encourage those around her to be equally tolerant. Paul Curran's production presented to rapturous acclaim in Genoa in May 2006, finds a rather unusual setting for this moral tale. He sets the story in the year 1912, in his own words, \"because I wanted to draw attention to social conflicts, and this was a period when class differences were very real\".","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/9cnwQSy7asTc1r8Jz1IWeOKKN5L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rossini - La Cenerentola","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1202406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Ganassi","original_name":"Sonia Ganassi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/AnBgLKGrOXqmYQCc6vCtrjVXUaN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cenerentola","credit_id":"67c3b268111cdd4ed8b48447","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2297390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renato Palumbo","original_name":"Renato Palumbo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3b27e89afff9e324e0983","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Curran","original_name":"Paul Curran","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3b295defa42aa0f4af7ed","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cnwQSy7asTc1r8Jz1IWeOKKN5L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
