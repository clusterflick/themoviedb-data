Father Frye (Colin Bates) discovers the body, only to face resistance from the church hierarchy, the local police and the surrounding community. His investigation is driven by the grief and distrust of the boy’s older sister, Siobhan (Ella Kennedy Davis), as well as the church’s apparent urgency to bury the truth. Together, Frye and Siobhan—united by their shared loss but divided by Frye’s unwavering loyalty to the institution—uncover dark secrets buried within the church. As they dig deeper, Frye’s faith and career are put to the test, especially as his superior, the bishop, and his former mentor, the Monsignor, will do whatever it takes to stop the truth from surfacing.","popularity":0.7322,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"These Little Ones Perish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Bates","original_name":"Colin Bates","popularity":0.241,"profile_path":"/2DPLA5o6ugweovd0fvdwhr8erZy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67c1db5ea7af2713c3a235da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5275339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Kennedy Davis","original_name":"Ella Kennedy Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67c1db89c67b368ba6359061","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Plana","original_name":"Tony Plana","popularity":1.0679,"profile_path":"/oiJaRVl9vvq7nqoGDNlymxpvJ0a.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67c1dbe9591b238d2635abb5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach Grenier","original_name":"Zach Grenier","popularity":0.6456,"profile_path":"/fSyQKZO39sUsqY283GXiScOg3Hi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67c1dbf1a7af2713c3a23641","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2183000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Noyer","original_name":"Alex Noyer","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/wY7O3ChYqF6CU47NXaZmKq3jzi9.jpg","credit_id":"67c1dba6ab2d8b81ccc8f8e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2663411,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurence Gendron","original_name":"Laurence Gendron","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1dbb2c67b368ba6359071","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Gendron","original_name":"Pierre Gendron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1dbc1591b238d2635ab74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113701,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Brothers","original_name":"Daniel Brothers","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1dbccb0c5684bada26176","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5275343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Hamilton","original_name":"Patrick Hamilton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1dc26591b238d2635abda","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35926714","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
