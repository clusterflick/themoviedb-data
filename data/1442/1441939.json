Yet even now people continue to live in this \"island on the mainland;\" they continue to battle the forces of nature in this inhospitable climate that always leaves them with an insufficient harvest. In actuality, many of the old people who continue to work in agriculture or the fishing industry only settled here after World War II. The occurrence of both the \"dollar shock\" and the \"oil shock\" abruptly cut back the national development plans, ... Then, in 1984, almost as if it had been planned from the beginning, it was decided that a nuclear reprocessing facility would be built at Rokkasho. In consequence, the opposition movement quietly began to reform.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/y02u79Tluh25erXi5O02kbRUnlv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People of Rokkasho","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5277904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akiko Kuraoka","original_name":"倉岡明子","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3a9618bd7ecb12b4af7db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5277905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuki Yamamura","original_name":"山邨伸貴","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3a9788bd7ecb12b4af7f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1695717,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yukio Kubota","original_name":"Yukio Kubota","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3a99604b6b222cf4e0405","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5277905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuki Yamamura","original_name":"山邨伸貴","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3aa5bab4da0b0d5b47e0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5277904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akiko Kuraoka","original_name":"倉岡明子","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3aa75a5e1e358c44af4c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5277924,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hiroshi Oda","original_name":"小田博","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3ac3d6466bd8ed24e0855","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y02u79Tluh25erXi5O02kbRUnlv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
