With two world championship titles, seven World Cup series titles, and over 140 competitive victories, Nys is widely considered one of the greatest cyclocross racers of all time.  The 2015-16 cyclocross season, his last before retirement, is documented with an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look into his training, his racing, his demons, and his relationship with his son, Thibau.  Sven: The Final Year, a film by van Jan Vandermotte, is the remarkable story of a living cycling legend at the edge of his prime.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/odEn2hWR0GxkJrANRthRsNfCrpM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sven: The Final Year","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/odEn2hWR0GxkJrANRthRsNfCrpM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
