She is an environmental prosecutor in northern Peru and has granted Fault Lines exclusive access to embed with her team as she investigates the traffickers moving the product through the country. We travel to the coast of Ecuador, which is experiencing tremendous cartel violence, to document the killing of sharks and the harvesting of their fins.
