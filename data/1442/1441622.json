As they navigate a world of mercenary soldiers, hidden agendas, and a looming shadow organization, their fractured past and lingering connection threaten to unravel.  Meanwhile, an agent known only as the Huntswoman fights to hold onto her mission—and her sanity—after a failed operation leaves her partner incapacitated. As the game of cat and mouse escalates, a severed hand, a locked safe, and a hallucinatory pink scarf become cryptic threads in a deadly web of intrigue.  Blurring the line between noir thriller and psychological horror, Cling Film is a haunting meditation on fate, guilt, and the choices that define who we are.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2027-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"How do you unstick from that which clings to you?","title":"Cling Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2027-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
