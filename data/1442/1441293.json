As ringmaster, Cardoso puts the fleas through their paces. Flea dancers appear first, followed by acrobats. Weight lifters, tango dancers, and tightrope artists appear in quick succession. We see a dramatic sword fight in silhouette, gasp as the Strongest Flea on Earth lifts a toy locomotive, and agonize as Sir Fleamund Hillary scales Mount Everest. The show concludes with a ceremonial feeding of the fleas as the credits roll.
