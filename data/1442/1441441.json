The film begins with August listening to a track of electronic dance music and immersing themselves in the audio. They are transported throughout the film to four dimensions in their mind's eye, reflecting separate versions of themself. The distinct layers of the music are performed by the different iterations of August, each exploring a corresponding movement vocabulary. The amalgamation of the separate versions of themself, and the way they dance, represents a synergy - an extended metaphor for how identity is fluid and multi-faceted.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/we5cQ6fzSwhRanjmY4FMfPHFOPo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Synergy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5276065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilie Bouet Conran","original_name":"Emilie Bouet Conran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67c25e8457f49c841653b31f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5276065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilie Bouet Conran","original_name":"Emilie Bouet Conran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c25e4657f49c841653b31b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5276065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilie Bouet Conran","original_name":"Emilie Bouet Conran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c25e5009a9b8496ddbe11e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5276066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Honor West","original_name":"Honor West","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c25e5f09a9b8496ddbe129","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5276066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Honor West","original_name":"Honor West","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c25e6971804deba153ba53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4843238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milly May Phillips","original_name":"Milly May Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c25e7671804deba153ba5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/we5cQ6fzSwhRanjmY4FMfPHFOPo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
