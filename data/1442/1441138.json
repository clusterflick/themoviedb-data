From the late 1960s to the late 1980s, hippies from East Berlin, Warsaw, Prague and Budapest dreamed of conquering a world that was actually closed to them. They wore long hair, beards and parkas, squatted houses, lived in communes, listened to blues and rock 'n' roll - music was their philosophy and world view. The documentary looks back at the flower children of the East, for whom Woodstock was further away than the moon.","popularity":0.1304,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":254868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noahfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flower Power Ost - Die Blumenkinder des Sozialismus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Flower Power Ost - Hippies in Osteuropa","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2880442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga 'Kora' Jackowska","original_name":"Olga 'Kora' Jackowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dQTT1ZiLOeNIlz3WJfa0BjqaBfL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c1924ac5de842b4ba26cc5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3945404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jurek Owsiak","original_name":"Jurek Owsiak","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/wz6JMsp8wvnzT4fpBNTDFtSvn2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c19261c5de842b4ba26cd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vratislav Brabenec","original_name":"Vratislav Brabenec","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c1923fc5de842b4ba26cbe","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Rentner","original_name":"Lutz Rentner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c191fae4a5b8bf00c90dda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515554,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Frank-Otto Sperlich","original_name":"Frank-Otto Sperlich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c19208c5de842b4ba26ca5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3936313,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephan Marche","original_name":"Stephan Marche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1922dc5de842b4ba26cb7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1067711","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1773,"name":"socialism"},{"id":225410,"name":"hippies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte","release_date":"2007-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
