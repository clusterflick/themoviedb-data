For generations they have been enjoyed by children and their parents. But few people know the woman who invented Cirkeline. Her name is Hanne Hastrup, and like many other women, she lost her place in the spotlight to a man – but in this case, to her own husband, artist and animator Jannik Hastrup. They found each other and began collaborating on the famous Cirkeline films, and now they sit side by side on a sofa and tell the story of the creation of the icon in the red dress with the black spots.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/vKOWpWK2KjvldcOsBafQzLGSz7l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2025-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cirkeline & the Invisible Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esther Wellejus","original_name":"Esther Wellejus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c050e7c029139b0e35a1c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cæcilie Østerby Sørensen","original_name":"Cæcilie Østerby Sørensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c050f7740c95a371a24d9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mads Jørgensen","original_name":"Mads Jørgensen","popularity":0.0834,"profile_path":"/zhT9lDLSyYvBl9mvY835SK9nIRh.jpg","credit_id":"67c0517b740c95a371a24dc2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/vKOWpWK2KjvldcOsBafQzLGSz7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Copenhagen International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2025-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DR2","release_date":"2025-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
