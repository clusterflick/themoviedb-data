Following the concept of the album, Vladi created nine different images, told the stories of nine characters. \"February Lasts\" is a real acting experience, a live concert in unique and thoughtful locations. Vladi travels inside bunkers and tunnels, trying to find the light in dark times. The filming location is the Furggels structure, essentially a fortress inside a mountain range, built before the World War II to protect Switzerland from Nazi Germany. Before Vladi, the object was almost never used for filming.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"February Lasts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
