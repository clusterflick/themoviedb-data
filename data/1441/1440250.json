Based on a true life story from a local residing in Batangas, Philippines, \"Lando\" is a young man looking to help out with the financial burden of his family. Gaining advice from his friends, he then seeks to become a vendor who sells ice cream to tourists in the middle of the ocean, sacrificing his education in exchange for earning money. In order to do so, he swims from cottage to cottage in the blazing sun, looking for a consumer that is willing to buy popsicles from a styrofoam box, where he keeps the frozen desserts cool.  But to what extent should Lando keep on pushing through, and how did he know when he was going to get to the fruitful path? Lando did not have the answers to these questions, and still he managed to push through everything. He lived to get the fruits of his labors, and for every second of it he had no regrets.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tUcX7lz6Q9h3G0qFLyfdAP5JuJJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life
