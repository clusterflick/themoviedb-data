He had his first hit in 1982 with the song Änglahund which led to him touring around Sweden on both big and small stages. In 2015 his new song Guld och gröna skogar came out, and again Hasse started to attract big crowds to his concerts. In the documentary, we follow Hasse during Melodifestivalen, at the children's theater, big summer festivals and while he sings at various nursing homes. But also at home in his house in Skåne.","popularity":0.1747,"poster_path":"/hF2YZ1ATPZOh90oDLVrqEjNXxc2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":220488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eyra Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2017-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hasse Andersson - Spelemannen från Kvinnaböske","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1671548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hasse Andersson","original_name":"Hasse Andersson","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/uyA913fn7fhiV8Bu49RyFvUUbuI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf52e5d49b2f5d573d66c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3190158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Flack","original_name":"Peter Flack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dEEKUX7RMPFnlWrBIpplgE6iUcx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf530739cb7820d0efb762","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1774759,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Monica Forsberg","original_name":"Monica Forsberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/89PTdElsNl8AalpA8EWBB03aerq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf531039cb7820d0efb779","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jannike Stenlund","original_name":"Jannike Stenlund","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sSlkUZ1Yf7s9FBjzpEXi0NOZBXP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf534139cb7820d0efb7b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3197820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nisse Hellberg","original_name":"Nisse Hellberg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/AtGu1urXB8k5biyK8cqZNL4LCqz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf531939cb7820d0efb78e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2209673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Henry","original_name":"Clara Henry","popularity":0.1968,"profile_path":"/cmZzyZGCijYsTvTNanysiBNYntR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf5320dd0adec14d562dd4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2217973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Kühler","original_name":"Marie Kühler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jjDBlyWvFYoMPiq6QqemNaNGdxP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf532ddd0adec14d562ddd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Pihleke","original_name":"Johan Pihleke","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fMbVWDncvjc5ILwk5LAeO6IMton.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf533641bb14f30956227a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590357,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anderz Wrethov","original_name":"Anderz Wrethov","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/10eeakN6lFP1eiu2ZjN574RyIBL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bf534841bb14f309562299","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikael J.
