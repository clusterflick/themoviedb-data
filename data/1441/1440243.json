Even 10 years after its first installation, it's still an introduction to the system. The film was geared towards software developers, computer science students and programmers and contains interviews with primary developers Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan, and many others. While widespread use of UNIX has waned, most modern operating systems have at least a conceptual foundation in UNIX.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y4DO2RsYzzWVHu1PlNFF3Sp2Ijd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56663,"logo_path":"/6Yf7cKVDcBRB5MePQaP2ldOHiWR.png","name":"AT&T","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The UNIX Operating System","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The UNIX System","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The UNIX Operating System: Making Computers More Productive","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor A.
