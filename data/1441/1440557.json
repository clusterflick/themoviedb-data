The festival, dedicated that year to the legendary Elizabeth Cotton, includes Bluegrass, Old Timey, Cajun, Country, and Gospel music. In contrast to the easygoing atmosphere of the festival, the film is a frenetic swirl of elaborately collaged shapes derived from traditional Pennsylvania Dutch designs. While sometimes the music seems to animate the image, at others the image itself becomes visual music on its own, eliciting ephemeral and sometimes forlorn emotions. The film offers an unusual meeting of a folk tradition and the avant garde, implying a fundamental connection between the two.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":161276,"logo_path":null,"name":"BB Optics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tracy's Family Folk Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2191503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brand","original_name":"Bill Brand","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/v8PHkZsZG24XJUZWQCv7RMecuP8.jpg","credit_id":"67c00bae834058f16ac8cd1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033444","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
