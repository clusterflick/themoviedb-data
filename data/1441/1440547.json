Shutter effects and swarming dots fragment the filmic surface so the picture oscillates between abstraction and recognition. The soundtrack quotes excerpts from anthropologist Franz Boasâ€™ 1930 text about a Kwakiutl Indian shaman. The story serves as a metaphor for the struggle of the artist practicing a new visual language. In the Boas text, a man relates his learning the ways of a shaman. Doubting the magic in shamanistic practice, he strives to understand traditional methods in order to discover the truth. Though he learns the secrets of his teachers and finds only tricks, he nonetheless becomes a powerful and famous shaman himself. This film is about the desire to master the magic of the image while following a path of doubt and skepticism.","popularity":0.0569,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":161276,"logo_path":null,"name":"BB Optics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trail to Koskimo: His First Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2191503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brand","original_name":"Bill Brand","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/v8PHkZsZG24XJUZWQCv7RMecuP8.jpg","credit_id":"67c0066e0d255c44c1c8ce75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033435","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
