Robert is a former racer who once followed his dream, but an accident off the racetrack ended up his career. He retired racing and opened his own car repair service.  His daughter Kira, who grew up without a mother, absorbed race aesthetics since she was a kid. When she grew up, she wanted to become a racer too. Robert is against the daughter's hobby, because he knows what reckless driving leads to. They lived the last years in this eternal conflict, until a random incident occurred in their lives.","popularity":0.368,"poster_path":"/sX52rHIBmnTuVLEDpJFEnjLERQ6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fotorange.ru","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incident","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Инцидент","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Incident","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Incident","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgiy
