Edassery Govindan Nair wrote the poem Kuttippuram Palam (Kuttippuram Bridge) in 1954 when a bridge was built across the river. In the poem, he shared the anxieties about modernity and mechanization and foretold the death of the river and the river  born culture. This film is not an adaptation or a retelling of the poem, but certainly inspired by it..  This film tries to reveal a day in the lives of a medical representative commutes across the Kuttippuram Bridge, a photographer taking the shots of the river, a man distributing mineral water on the banks of the river. The bridge becomes a symbol of the superficial life we live.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kuttippuram Palam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Kuttippuram Bridge","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabari Janaki","original_name":"Sabari Janaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67c066bcc5de842b4ba24bea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shabeer Thurakkal","original_name":"Shabeer Thurakkal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67c066d49adcd2562535a125","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajeev Kalikavu","original_name":"Rajeev Kalikavu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67c066dfc5de842b4ba24bfa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prathap Joseph","original_name":"Prathap Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c064fdc029139b0e35a5ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prathap Joseph","original_name":"Prathap Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06516834058f16ac8df1a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prathap Joseph","original_name":"Prathap Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c0653d14a4396cafc8e542","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2015062,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amrith Shankar","original_name":"Amrith Shankar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c065b2b6c7e3425ca25383","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272821,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philomina Joseph","original_name":"Philomina Joseph","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c065cd8c386c4e5bc8dd06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Prakash Joseph","original_name":"Prakash Joseph","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c065e29adcd2562535a096","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aparna K","original_name":"Aparna K","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06607b6c7e3425ca25419","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prathap Joseph","original_name":"Prathap Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06617b6c7e3425ca25432","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861311,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shijin P Raj","original_name":"Shijin P Raj","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c0672bc029139b0e35a6b5","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272832,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Irshad Pang","original_name":"Irshad Pang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c067379adcd2562535a173","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
