While both of these scenes are essential to the life as a sister, Light of Love takes a deeper look into understanding the call... the \"why\" of religious life. By interviewing five sisters from five orders across the United States, the film places viewers face to face in intimate conversations with these amazing women. What does it mean to be called? What are the struggles of religious life? How have you seen God move through your ministry? These questions and others are addressed throughout the film.  The film itself is very simple: 60 minutes designed for viewers to quiet their surroundings and enter into convent, the food pantry, the hospital, and the chapel. With minimal music and simple visuals, Light of Love gives viewers a look into the lives, suffering, and joys of religious life captured in a way like never before.","popularity":0.2799,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Light of Love takes a deeper look into understanding the call... the \"why\" of religious life.","title":"Light of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":745,"name":"nun"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":18396,"name":"catholic"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Light of Love Promotional Video","key":"SAiZ6Y6qdwE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-23T21:25:04.000Z","id":"67bf3fcfd727e5fa90efc308"}]}}}
