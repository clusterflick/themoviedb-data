These out-of-area experiences are rooted in safety, community, wellness, education, and fun. Our program is always free to families. Citizen Film is currently in production on a documentary film with Adama, profiling several families who have been part of the Weekend-Adventures program. We are building an awareness campaign to roll out with the documentary, which will build partnerships within the Tenderloin to support the youth and their families.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":230181,"logo_path":"/9bjMEufvWqfNp1ZpO9c9Vc9sdxf.png","name":"Citizen Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weekend-Adventures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5273910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adama Bryant","original_name":"Adama Bryant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c0f0a9e4a5b8bf00c8f40e","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
