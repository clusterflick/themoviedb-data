His Government and his political leadership starred in the brightest moment since the return of democracy in 1983, both in terms of memory, truth and justice, as well as breaking the infernal circle of debt and subjection to external powers, energetically reactivating the economy and employment, promoting science and technology and the expansion of rights. We will make this cinematographic narrative hand in hand and with the voices of the men and women who were affected by these policies, and whose lives changed thanks to them.","popularity":0.1579,"poster_path":"/3v5ih6degbw1WtTNbqSdXw3fGtq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102626,"logo_path":"/hejnYBBwutw4U2dA6LGfMArjya0.png","name":"Cine
