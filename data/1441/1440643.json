Since its founding in 1998, more than a thousand people have traveled to Zurich to end their lives with the help of the organization Dignitas. \"Dignitas - Death on Prescription\" is a documentary about an organization that provides people with terminal and incurable illnesses, intense unrelenting pain, and depression with a peaceful death. The organization's founder, lawyer Ludwig Minelli, is often the target of insults, especially from politicians, despite the fact that most Swiss citizens support the option of medically assisted suicide.","popularity":0.636,"poster_path":"/mwCPOAhXA9OxDsKaoV1vCMLIg26.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The DIGNITAS motto “To live with dignity – To die with dignity” is a promise.","title":"Dignitas - Death on Prescription","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dignitas - Death on Prescription","type":"translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536666,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Bernard Menoud","original_name":"Jean-Bernard Menoud","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c049a40d255c44c1c8d86c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3201968","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":807,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mwCPOAhXA9OxDsKaoV1vCMLIg26.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3737,"name":"dying and death"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":41589,"name":"dying"},{"id":185740,"name":"ethical dilemma"},{"id":206662,"name":"euthanasia"},{"id":211553,"name":"assisted suicide"},{"id":256853,"name":"hospice"},{"id":273916,"name":"palliative care"},{"id":313408,"name":"ethics problem"},{"id":338090,"name":"hospice care"},{"id":338350,"name":"assisted dying"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
