In 2006, she managed to escape, and the world discovered an astonishingly articulate and intelligent young woman. Not only did Peter Reichard film 14 hours of conversations with Kampusch, but he was also the very first filmmaker to obtain exclusive access to the house where she was imprisoned. This is the most complete, explicit and revealing documentary in which Kampusch has participated.","popularity":0.3656,"poster_path":"/1N8bJPTWdL80I6SsoRIywrAw839.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natascha Kampusch: The Whole Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1117507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natascha Kampusch","original_name":"Natascha Kampusch","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/2YB36zT5scJJQuFJgkizh8BH81B.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Natascha Kampusch (Self)","credit_id":"67bfe35910e79c3424a23f58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitta Sirny-Kampusch","original_name":"Brigitta Sirny-Kampusch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Brigitta Sirny-Kampusch (Self)","credit_id":"67bfe370072a707ae93593be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017274,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Solomon","original_name":"Andrew Solomon","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Andrew Solomon (Self - Narrator)","credit_id":"67bfe3b28c386c4e5bc8c809","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Holzapfel","original_name":"Ernst Holzapfel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ernst Holzapfel (Self)","credit_id":"67bfe3d88c386c4e5bc8c81a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Teodorescu","original_name":"Alina Teodorescu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bfe269740c95a371a24570","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122725,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Reichard","original_name":"Peter Reichard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bfe27a740c95a371a24575","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2248260,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Kolb","original_name":"Martin Kolb","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bfe2ac8c386c4e5bc8c7c4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272202,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian Riedl","original_name":"Florian Riedl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bfe2cc8c386c4e5bc8c7d8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3521906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Schmid","original_name":"Philippe Schmid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bfe33310e79c3424a23f50","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6974254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1N8bJPTWdL80I6SsoRIywrAw839.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1930,"name":"kidnapping"},{"id":170865,"name":"child kidnapping"},{"id":207691,"name":"abuse"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
