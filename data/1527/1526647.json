Lee’s image circulated widely across newspapers, magazines, and photographs—serving specific purposes and cultural narratives. Over time, these representations fractured, faded, and reemerged, leaving silences in the archive and gaps in visibility. The cut-out fragments from the scattered information are pieced together to imagine the child’s unspoken point of view throughout his wandering life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"A Real Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Jinsoo Kim","original_name":"김진수","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6894b2f68d775c499128a575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p1QQWk0Nw2Gu1HICoC6WGq8FLn3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
