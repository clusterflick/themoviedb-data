Lots of saturated color, and yes, saturated tampons, make Snatch a first. Set in a lesbian whorehouse from Hell (Hell is America), a gaggle of giggling garterbelt gargoyles let us in on their scenes and secrets.  We watch them boss around their nerdy clients, women who play men with an endearing sexual awkwardness and are more victims than victimizers. The best parts of this video are the visual jokes, a sacrificial peace symbol and a living vagina dentata. â€” Source: Frameline 1991 festival catalog","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snatch","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
