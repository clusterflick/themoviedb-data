Taj-ul-Mulk, a prince from the East, seeks the flower to cure his blind father. The legend's origins are debated: one version traces it to a 19th-century translation of a Persian tale, while another points to a 16th-century narrative from Abely Sheikh. The story was a favorite on the Parsee stage, particularly the scenes where Taj-ul-Mulk battles his villainous brothers, who steal the flower. The tale also features Bakavali turning to stone and her eventual human rebirth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fE2A4LbyF9sAGmjpYZOqM9GSPoH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kohinoor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1924-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gul-e-Bakavali","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3558658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmed Khalil","original_name":"Ahmed Khalil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tajul Malik","credit_id":"6894238779ad68d8a69db123","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sultana","original_name":"Sultana","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6894238d9659c2236aa32a2e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zubeida","original_name":"Zubeida","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/4xusVwgS1vvukKM6KZAdCvXIk88.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bakavali","credit_id":"68942395b43eb5e4e199a7c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2284229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moti","original_name":"Moti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6894239ab880bfd73c99a82b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamna","original_name":"Jamna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"689423a0d1e3abf57a07c3d2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fatma Begum","original_name":"Fatma Begum","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/jOFU10pkGZncHVFebE4bl9ys5zF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"689423a608ab980e9c4d907d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noor Mohammad Charlie","original_name":"Noor Mohammad Charlie","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"689423b1b39084dbdf07c42c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4013355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Usha Rani","original_name":"Usha Rani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"689423b6c6be8e96899db0d2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4893733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabita Devi","original_name":"Sabita Devi","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"689423c07e1e2deb77a32a63","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2284231,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mohanlal G.
