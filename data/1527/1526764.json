Not only does the Spanish government make the entry of a population that used to be Spanish very difficult, but it also intends to use these peoples’ identity to bury a situation that has been uncomfortable for them for 41 years, thus solving a problem that won’t be fixed until it has disappeared.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7mhMCqhiDroYn3u409gi00swUb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leitmotiv Ideas Visuales","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The documentary about the Stateless Sahrawis","title":"Bidun Hawiya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5612652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nayat Ahmed Abdesslam","original_name":"Nayat Ahmed Abdesslam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6894f4a70d2104cc4e07c6d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/7mhMCqhiDroYn3u409gi00swUb0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":356809,"name":"sahrawi diaspora"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
