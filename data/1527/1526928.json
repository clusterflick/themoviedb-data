The eunuchs introduce a special world, where for them divinity and daily life alternate in the flash of an exquisitely made-up eye. A 3,600-strong ancient sect who claim to be descended from the gods live in relative luxury. Other Indian men explain why they too underwent painful castration.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oGqePa0aAV2wp30SSGUhJdXGHMW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241340,"logo_path":"/8X4KdtpSksl6FdRU7OI5O0u7K0O.png","name":"BBC Elstree","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hijras.
