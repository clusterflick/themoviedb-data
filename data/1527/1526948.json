Calcutta Theatres industry. Kamala (Kanan Devi) is the star of the Ruby Theatre owned by her guardian Maheshbabu. Narendra (Sanyal) is the equally popular star in the rival Bina Theatre, which he abandons to join the Ruby repertoire when he falls in love with Kamala. In a lyrical sequence in the countryside, they marry in a poor peasant setting. Narendra then shows his true colours and forbids Kamala to continue her acting career. She returns to the stage anyway while Narendra stays among the peasants. He later returns to the Bina Theatre and its success is intercut with the bankruptcy of the Ruby Theatre.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pxHZHJe9G31hi1CxieYSjbYztOW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176990,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Theatres, Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1940-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Har Jeet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1660107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanan Devi","original_name":"Kanan Devi","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/yaFiZKavtJfgUVOaFwt6e9h9SEm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kamala","credit_id":"689570e3c6c586dad528a7b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pahadi Sanyal","original_name":"Pahadi Sanyal","popularity":1.1949,"profile_path":"/8DMo6ioDVPxFhXJTPiMyYNJFpBa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maheshbabu Narendra","credit_id":"689570ed96ea1c5c4728a7d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5613609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meera Dutta","original_name":"Meera Dutta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"689570f57a8b0fdba766eb48","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chhaya Devi","original_name":"Chhaya Devi","popularity":0.4949,"profile_path":"/x8uKV8mWfFQytCanKLWi5Pyz2Ao.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"689570fdb39084dbdf07c982","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nawab","original_name":"Nawab","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68957106dd85ea81fb9db4c0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nemo","original_name":"Nemo","popularity":1.6828,"profile_path":"/hHOPZoRdG4OvHHXLV3XadecsyFP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6895710ef2a1a9c45e9226d1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amar Mullick","original_name":"Amar Mullick","popularity":0.1703,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6895712dd4558c5a6299aca8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amar Mullick","original_name":"Amar Mullick","popularity":0.1703,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6895713ac6efb9859807c963","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":927870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Upendranath Ganguly","original_name":"Upendranath Ganguly","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6895715cc9554823cba32ff0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Parimal Ghosh","original_name":"Parimal Ghosh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68957166a04440de8d28a834","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0245142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pxHZHJe9G31hi1CxieYSjbYztOW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
