The capital is also home to a flourishing experimental music scene, where young Chinese respond to their surroundings with a cathartic racket. Howling into Harmony takes an intimate look at the lives of three local musicians and their parents, exploring the delicate balance between rock n' roll rebelliousness and family, Westernized culture and deeply-rooted nationalism. Using underground music as an entry point, the film explores the world of young Chinese in the big city.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howling into Harmony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3789568,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joshua Frank","original_name":"Joshua Frank","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6894bbdec6efb9859807c6ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2862860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
