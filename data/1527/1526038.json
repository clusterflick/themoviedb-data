He lives with Ratha Sivaramalingam, Puniya Sundarampillai, and around fifty other Tamils in a Salvation Army refugee camp in Zollikofen near Bern. Time is killed in the camp. Shopping at Shoppyland, if the social security money is enough. Regular work is not allowed. Practicing the dreaded police interrogation in role-playing games. Getting summer clothes from the Red Cross. Waiting for the mailman to bring newspapers and letters from home. “My children always ask me what my life is like in Switzerland and when I'm coming home.” (Translated from
