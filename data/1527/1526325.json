But what happens if the child doesn't share those same dreams? Caught between two worlds, the son (a wolf) must decide whether that being true to himself is worth the loss of his human father's approval. Suppressing his true nature in front of his father, the wolf stands on two legs and hides the characteristics that make him a wolf. Only until the wolf stands up for himself does the father see his son for what he really is, and both must come to terms with what that means. Breed is a touching depiction a child's struggle for self-identity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5610581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanton Cameron","original_name":"Stanton Cameron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6893bab78ec5a7992866e52e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5610581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanton Cameron","original_name":"Stanton Cameron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6893babe15889903109daf62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3328388","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
