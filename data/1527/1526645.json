Some are in search of rest, the others eager to give a hand and work. Eventually all join the shoveling and building. That night, a group of new immigrants, among them Holocaust survivors, arrive to join the mixed group. Within a while, the war arrives. Yoshke, the community's most dedicated member, encourages his brethren to stay and fight, citing the community’s slogan: “Ein Breira” – “There is no choice”. When supplies are dropped almost within enemy lines, Yoshke ventures out to retrieve them. He is wounded, and dies upon completing his mission. The film concludes with words from Yoshke’s diary, bearing encouragement for new immigrants to Israel.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song of the Negev","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"1949-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
