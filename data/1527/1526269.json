Imprisoned for a murder he did not commit, John Brant escapes and ends up out west where, after giving the local lawmen the slip, he joins up with an outlaw gang. Brant finds out that ‘Jones’, one of the outlaws he has become friends with, committed the murder that Brant was sent up for, but has no knowledge that anyone was ever put in jail for his crime. Willing to forgive and forget, Brant doesn’t realize that ‘Jones’ has not only fallen for the same pretty shopgirl Brant has, but begins to suspect that Brant is not truly an outlaw.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pxECuO3TeIiUYb09gDsTWCkj3G2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fugitive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Wayne","original_name":"John Wayne","popularity":1.8185,"profile_path":"/ggHZ8WTKaoD9bGRhmC1FlV9sXwL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John","credit_id":"6893a558f5b423dbfb637761","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Shubert","original_name":"Nancy Shubert","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/7QE8TkoXzWMwOZRLCge7kgkHFGA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"6893a56e64fb58b81a772bb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lane Chandler","original_name":"Lane Chandler","popularity":2.667,"profile_path":"/zwUk9TYX6u2Y7jr6VDEW1NW7Flr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joseph","credit_id":"6893a57be85e91436ef3f101","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540460,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henry Hall","original_name":"Henry Hall","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dad Blake","credit_id":"6893a587dca636492a7d04c2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Taliaferro","original_name":"Hal Taliaferro","popularity":1.2768,"profile_path":"/xAg9Rx5g3M58oPE46eD6yJK9ea5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Deputy","credit_id":"6893a5934da4b4d7b9ffd552","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Mix","original_name":"Art Mix","popularity":2.0273,"profile_path":"/wiPJY17RCjLIKAg6bewuEhvBkNu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Henchman","credit_id":"6893a59e7a932371aaab9a3b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Burns","original_name":"Bob Burns","popularity":1.6002,"profile_path":"/xqajGPjd1X6JpigS9tJaeNc59pr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"6893a5b482c3dddb02dbfc02","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Whitaker","original_name":"Slim Whitaker","popularity":1.2863,"profile_path":"/jrDw1jXr26U7XC4lTSbwUHCohf6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Henchman Dick","credit_id":"6893a5c0dfcb21ea9063774b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Dyer","original_name":"William Dyer","popularity":0.555,"profile_path":"/9tewzf3cGtVT5LiR3PAOkypCNNe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Blind Pete","credit_id":"6893a5cd36d4212ab71d5f64","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Bell","original_name":"Hank Bell","popularity":1.3581,"profile_path":"/kJrAa6i3IK9I3AyNUOCRzuLh13P.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henchman","credit_id":"6893a5d7a68de2d06b262779","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90070,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Armand Schaefer","original_name":"Armand Schaefer","popularity":2.1769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6893a5ef763439387bf3f182","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33174,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Archie Stout","original_name":"Archie Stout","popularity":0.5853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6893a5fa5c59c3c4f811e88c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89748,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lindsley Parsons","original_name":"Lindsley Parsons","popularity":1.8341,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6893a62a47b5ef6d13ab9a31","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pxECuO3TeIiUYb09gDsTWCkj3G2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
