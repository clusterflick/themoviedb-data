For baby boomers, it represented freedom and spontaneity. The band rejected the world of Communist cultural policy with its uniqueness and refusal to conform, something in which the best of the artistic intelligentsia and political dissidents saw value. They attended their concerts, and the film recalls their experiences. At times, one feels as if they are watching a spy film parody, as one gains insight into the secret files containing reports from agents embedded within the audience.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/bBoxuvNdUDMZ1z1JbLjGqtji5wn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Örökmozgó","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":270354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Munkart
