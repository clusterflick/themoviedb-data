As the clock ticks, numbers on her paper distort, and an  overwhelming creature of her fears grows within her mind, feeding on her rising panic.

By accepting her learning difficulties, she finds clarity realizing that her challenges are not her  weaknesses, but her strengths in disguise.","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":"/dnjWR3fWUHAe4rBvyOV6aNuyNBx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Animation,
