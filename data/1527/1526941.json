The film has sub-plots involving marital discord between Karcher and his wife Debbie, and the obsessive quest of Richards to convince the CIA that alien life exists. The twist comes as the aliens, represented by three shadows, reveal their purpose: to transport Freeport to their home planet Altaris to create a human zoo.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sLiG63vvYGzUKNjRhe5Lrlr3gwX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-03-24","revenue":501,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Firelight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5613558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Robyn","original_name":"Robert Robyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tony Karcher","credit_id":"68956b0c5da3418c3d66eac4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178076,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beth Weber","original_name":"Beth Weber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Debbie Karcher","credit_id":"68956b20a871f4e1f766eb86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucky Lohr","original_name":"Lucky Lohr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Howard Richards","credit_id":"68956b2d32bf3c70c8795cc1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5613563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Peyou","original_name":"Margaret Peyou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Helen Richards","credit_id":"68956b3cad6d1e67739db64e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5613565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Case","original_name":"Chuck Case","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Teenage Boy","credit_id":"68956b5b7a48f29927c6ea6f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5613573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Emery","original_name":"Charles Emery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Prof Schnieder -
