One night when Richard comes over, he starts to act differently, laughing and smiling on his phone. Mac becomes curious of this and tries to figure out why, but Richard won’t budge, seemingly insisting that it’s nothing important. Through a series of wacky and sneaky, “stealthy\" shenanigans, Mac tries to unlock the secrets in Richard’s phone.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/8KhPTcoy8QoXGE17D0GKZXt6OtP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270465,"logo_path":null,"name":"McCinema Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Bros One Phone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5612796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Pucciarelli","original_name":"Joseph Pucciarelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mac","credit_id":"68950459f8f1258bf8a32ea7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5612793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miller Brandon","original_name":"Miller Brandon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"689503d8847fb7125999aae1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5350860,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason McCluskey","original_name":"Jason McCluskey","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6895041dbca1e77e01922423","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3781737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Mahoney","original_name":"Natalie Mahoney","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/gd0ofA3DBWzhkFBmEBQtTXAU36A.jpg","credit_id":"6895043910680ef77a795afe","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4908258,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Xing Wu","original_name":"Xing Wu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6895048ddd85ea81fb9db2bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235815,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Hannah Sutherland","original_name":"Hannah Sutherland","popularity":0.3425,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689504a95c1766151466e9ef","department":"Camera","job":"BTS Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5612799,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dani Cohen","original_name":"Dani Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689504ba8d775c499128a6ac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5350856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Sutherland","original_name":"Hannah Sutherland","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689504ca7ab59621c7795908","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5350860,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason McCluskey","original_name":"Jason McCluskey","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689504d77b4e7864029db3d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3781737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Mahoney","original_name":"Natalie Mahoney","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/gd0ofA3DBWzhkFBmEBQtTXAU36A.jpg","credit_id":"689504e661ab8ad240795a21","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5350860,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason McCluskey","original_name":"Jason McCluskey","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689504ff404952eb677959a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5350860,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason McCluskey","original_name":"Jason McCluskey","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6895067f678ee19c0692257d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8KhPTcoy8QoXGE17D0GKZXt6OtP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":356828,"name":"two brothers over mom"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
