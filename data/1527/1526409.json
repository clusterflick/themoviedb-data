This summer there will be more. New tenant Gibbs and former resident Alex must figure out why the walls creak, bugs infest the property - and who's next.  Newly separated from his wife, Gibbs (Determan) rents a home where, in the summer of 2017, JJ Tyler (Harder) seemingly lost his mind after the death of this mother, Crystal Lake (O'Dea). By the time police arrived several bodies had piled up and rumors the house was haunted began circulating among the neighborhood children. Now, as noises within the walls increase nightly, and bugs infest the property inside and out, Gibbs reaches out to former resident Alex (Vanderhoef) to reveal why the house may have a \"life\" of its own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":187647,"logo_path":null,"name":"B+BOY Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why scream for help when no one's alive?","title":"Safe Inside 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":97803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darcey Vanderhoef","original_name":"Darcey Vanderhoef","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f7b0ef2a2c56029db05d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2876520,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael Thomas Determan","original_name":"Michael Thomas Determan","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f7c98ec5a7992866e5bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Ona Paukstelis","original_name":"Tina Ona Paukstelis","popularity":0.1941,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f7dacbd95278a928a29a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Dilloo","original_name":"Karen Dilloo","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f7e768a16274c792208f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3304735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Oilar","original_name":"Michael Oilar","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f7fa756989794599a6e6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sy Stevens","original_name":"Sy Stevens","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f80dc8eef1c371795698","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brinke Stevens","original_name":"Brinke Stevens","popularity":2.9296,"profile_path":"/vM5RgQ50bB97hWHL7jvN8CVi5nx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f846915ca4f04066e5c2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith O'Dea","original_name":"Judith O'Dea","popularity":1.3007,"profile_path":"/nihfq3xdU22xnxHKmqA0Mv9rUvv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f8580e33ad03d49db01b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5611070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Harder","original_name":"Chris Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6893f86e1d34f51f6399a6b0","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Paul Collum","original_name":"Jason Paul Collum","popularity":0.4813,"profile_path":"/eRq1dOMsPURpBbM0eG9ZVg6032v.jpg","credit_id":"6893f88c223615fd5a9dafcb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Paul Collum","original_name":"Jason Paul Collum","popularity":0.4813,"profile_path":"/eRq1dOMsPURpBbM0eG9ZVg6032v.jpg","credit_id":"6893f89d526f7ea91099a770","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Paul Collum","original_name":"Jason Paul Collum","popularity":0.4813,"profile_path":"/eRq1dOMsPURpBbM0eG9ZVg6032v.jpg","credit_id":"6893f8b08d753eeba007c2fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5611075,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"J.J.
