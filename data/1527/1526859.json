The movie is set in a parallel universe, in which the planet Argonia exists in the same location as our Earth. Argonia is invaded by a horde known as the Sirroms, and the planet's Guardian Force has to find a way to save it. In a last-ditch effort to save the planet, the Guardian opens a rift between Argonia and our Earth, and selects four warriors from Earth's timeline, who have an inert DNA strand that marks them as potential saviours of Argonia.  Manipulating the DNA of these four ordinary people, the Guardian is able to bring these planet-saving abilities to the surface, and turns them into the eponymous Advanced Warriors. You decide what path the warriors take, and make critical decisions for them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/czyIE7MVyf626FBzNg78D2f0e31.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"YOU decide which path the warriors take, which critical decisions they make and, inevitably YOU DECIDE WHO LIVES AND DIES","title":"Advanced Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carrigan","original_name":"John Carrigan","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marshall","credit_id":"689525b4bfb0c41f73795adb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chase Masterson","original_name":"Chase Masterson","popularity":0.6501,"profile_path":"/tCev4tcCGNBfGP03AadjWj1F5ZR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Imogen","credit_id":"689525d4ece20b11df4d9409","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Strickson","original_name":"Mark Strickson","popularity":1.3985,"profile_path":"/xqk0PxWC4d2nHyZcgZ13uu2l0Ae.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guardian Force","credit_id":"689525e492b5f229a299aba6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Nichols","original_name":"Rebecca Nichols","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"6895261948fe7ce4b09224ef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Bulloch","original_name":"Jeremy Bulloch","popularity":0.3516,"profile_path":"/sioJ1UcQPgHktGgUXrb5FKBjiYp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Max","credit_id":"6895262916f584496607c6c3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584532,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andrew Dymond","original_name":"Andrew Dymond","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68952642651609a6d599aa87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0293750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/czyIE7MVyf626FBzNg78D2f0e31.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
