An original 15-minute video clip of a street scene at a crossroad was captured and was played on a 25-inch TV screen. One corner of the TV-screened footage was filmed again to produce the 2nd video footage. This re-filming process repeated 7 times using the same focal distance (of the first re-filming's settings), and 8 video footages in 7 generations were produced. The images and sound became more abstract each time. The video installation was first staged in Hangzhou in 1996.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/h7G8MEc1NXwxGI9uRlyj38krYkw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Focal Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3241593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Peili","original_name":"Zhang Peili","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/zrakqTwIXafdpZ0cNgm7vLRmpCT.jpg","credit_id":"689330516032b8e1dedbfb90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7G8MEc1NXwxGI9uRlyj38krYkw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
