Eight men have already been convicted for their part in the story; two others were acquitted at a recent, highly publicised Old Bailey trial. With the help of the man leading the police hunt, Det Chief Supt Boyce , and with insights into the criminal underworld from Andrew Jennings and John McVicar , the film follows the tortuous trail of the gold.  Using some dramatic reconstruction, it shows how this massive amount of gold, beyond the robbers' wildest expectations, was smelted in a garden shed, passed over the counter of unsuspicious local banks, and fed into an international 'money laundering' operation, with much of it ending up, thanks to Britain's relaxed exchange controls, in the American drugs market.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34378587","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
