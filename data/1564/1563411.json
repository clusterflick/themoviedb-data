The first is a tropical paradise inhabited by female soldiers, as imagined in Madame Mao’s The Red Detachment of Women (ballet film: 1970). In her Red Detachment, a peasant girl undergoes a political awakening: the homicidal rage directed at her landlord is tamed, and she becomes a regulated, productive military agent. The second is an all-women state-of-the-art industrial pork processing plant, accommodating both Chinese factories’ preference for female workers with the latest in scientific management techniques.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/v21vrug17xzcLqIqWJaFkMElwSM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Detachment of Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jen Liu","original_name":"Jen Liu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f01b349df5e9c20a1e1e10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1192,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v21vrug17xzcLqIqWJaFkMElwSM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":795},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1213,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5UT1fiS5vlFtCycv4MY0dHpXUa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":809}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
