Across eight months, each expecting parent grapples with a personal journey while also confronting their collective views on class, gender, and family. The group finds strength in this growing community while facing the humour and heartbreak of their shared experience.  A single repeated camera set up affords audiences an opportunity to investigate these characters and participate in the narrative as a silent observer.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tWuDTGYwGpCV9jtUj02ATEegtoL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":277478,"logo_path":null,"name":"View Shift Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A group of people gather weekly to discuss their anxiety around being pregnant as they must mentally come to terms with their evolving change and new lives.","title":"GROUP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda E","original_name":"Linda E","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aggie","credit_id":"68f171518c5b8a17aab22ede","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gayaneh Lara","original_name":"Gayaneh Lara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bethanne","credit_id":"68f171626e3ef162605a50a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Clayton-Kelly","original_name":"Zoe Clayton-Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jettie","credit_id":"68f1717b3d6f73c56374f50d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kit Mayland","original_name":"Kit Mayland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Max","credit_id":"68f1718d6e3ef162605a50b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christie Peto","original_name":"Christie Peto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Maud","credit_id":"68f171996680c3a9eb4d1d4c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zahra Jassi","original_name":"Zahra Jassi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Simone","credit_id":"68f171a702939306b30e45d7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meredith Kenton","original_name":"Meredith Kenton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f170dd5eec4b46a574f52c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meredith Kenton","original_name":"Meredith Kenton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f170ea891aa4c87e0e460a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meredith Kenton","original_name":"Meredith Kenton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f170f7de6c9fd842ec56ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753910,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Josie Copeland","original_name":"Josie Copeland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1729c91c2020a290e45df","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753911,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Victoria Cortes","original_name":"Victoria Cortes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f172b51941833dc90e460a","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753913,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liyana Manso","original_name":"Liyana Manso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f172fea3cd4786165a5085","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tWuDTGYwGpCV9jtUj02ATEegtoL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
