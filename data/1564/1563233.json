Using found home movies and travel films from the 1960s, I respond to the material through collage, painting and abstraction directly onto film, aiming to create a psychological traversal across a vast unknown. Landscape acts as a basis for exploration, and characters emerge and descend, representing the self or the other. The onscreen horizon is often literally split; the characters and places become a mirror for one another, meditating on our own ability to contain multiple versions of self, identity and internal narratives about our own stories, paths and histories.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Split Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5751193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Marie Dake","original_name":"Lauren Marie Dake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68efc3a27da8dac2a90963ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
