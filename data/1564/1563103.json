The narrative is told in three parts: The reporter, a mother and her “addict son” David. Seeking to reveal systemic problems and stereotypes of addiction and mental health the film and its title have been appropriated from an 1970s BBC expose. In making the film the filmmaker and footage were exposed to glue through sandwiching pieces of film together before ripping them apart.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"On the Glue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5750744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Johnson","original_name":"Dave Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ef94537098833b71f96c19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2025-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
