This was a \"training film\" made by the Mansfield Police Department and Highway Safety Foundation, under the aegis of Safety Enterprises, Inc. This film, along with a film called \"The Child Molester\" (which I have never seen) was made in response to the 1962 discovery of two little girls who were found dead near a creek in a park. It is introduced by the Chief of Police at that time. It goes on to present us with a \"sting operation\" set up in a public men's restroom in downtown Mansfield's Central Park (which was closed as a \"public nuisance\" shortly afterward), in which we are presented with scene after scene of gay men having sex with one another in the said restroom. We are even presented with the mugshots of said men, along with the disposition of their case, usually \"Committed to Lima State Hospital\" or \"Committed to the Ohio State Penitentary\" \"for a term of 1 to 20 years: Psychopath\".","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highway Safety Foundation (HSF)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camera Surveilance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
