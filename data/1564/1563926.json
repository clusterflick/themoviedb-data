It is a journey from meditative introspection to moments of intense sonic expression and polyrhythmic aggression. It is a connection to the native land through emotional sonic steppes, it is resistance to light. \"Truth\" expresses the quiet truth that lies in the heart.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5722550,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kateryna Zavoloka","original_name":"Kateryna Zavoloka","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f15d894170c0ab54c24224","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bardak Film Fest","release_date":"2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
