His monotonous daily life is shaken by the arrival of a shadow theater troupe in the village square. As Nikolas watches the performances, he experiences powerful emotions, recognizing fragments of his own life reflected on the screen. He begins to identify with the characters and engages in a dialogue both with Karagiozis—the beloved folk hero—and the puppeteer behind him. The cheerful spectacle becomes for Nikolas a dreamlike escape from his harsh reality.  On the second night, he sneaks out of his home once again to join the audience of Karagiozis. But will his father’s strictness prevent him from reaching the place where he is supposed to meet the puppeteer the following morning? And what surprise does the puppeteer have in store for him?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/yyy2wREz6crOkIWlGJV7eapzuLC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A moving story about a young boy in the '50s and his encounter with the shadow theater.","title":"In the shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"In the shadows","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5752992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lefteris Konstantinou","original_name":"Lefteris Konstantinou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nicholas","credit_id":"68f1102a82c914a0c6389fa9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5752993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thanasis Spiropoulos","original_name":"Thanasis Spiropoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shadow Puppeteer","credit_id":"68f110354170c0ab54c240a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2550856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hronis Pavlidis","original_name":"Χρόνης Παυλίδης","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3bJ8NhUTnFkcpB55yfQcjkaGnQP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Father","credit_id":"68f1107023a2cce870ad7f4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1392299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikol Kokkinou","original_name":"Νικόλ Κοκκίνου","popularity":0.3013,"profile_path":"/9cDGSKYO5s80DjRcw6K8E6nuA3J.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Miss Ourania","credit_id":"68f110b058fd6c0d3e1e2153","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2914747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikos Vasilikiotis","original_name":"Nikos Vasilikiotis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Yiannis","credit_id":"68f110d273cecba9c61e228f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Apostolou","original_name":"Δημήτρης Αποστόλου","popularity":0.4838,"profile_path":"/fbKa0jQBrHFF41vO9qKHXrvs7hY.jpg","credit_id":"68f10fe91211fae19e389eca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Apostolou","original_name":"Δημήτρης Αποστόλου","popularity":0.4838,"profile_path":"/fbKa0jQBrHFF41vO9qKHXrvs7hY.jpg","credit_id":"68f10ff752b4a48e395030fe","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Apostolou","original_name":"Δημήτρης Αποστόλου","popularity":0.4838,"profile_path":"/fbKa0jQBrHFF41vO9qKHXrvs7hY.jpg","credit_id":"68f110f6c6b854bf52a82ebc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1620642,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikos Nikolettos","original_name":"Νίκος Νικολέττος","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f11108be6512b5ddad7e4f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5752995,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fotis Milonas","original_name":"Fotis Milonas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1112c8a07028facc24018","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686965,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dimitris Horianopoulos","original_name":"Δημήτρης Χωριανόπουλος","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1114a680a34d7841e2176","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5752996,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christos Karetsos","original_name":"Christos Karetsos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1116fc51d9b431bc24101","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936184,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikos Bougioukos","original_name":"Nikos Bougioukos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1118bde68232e9ee2bb0e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":878,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2f4QVRNzFOe7Pvd6SJbJs3qv0eK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":585},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":801,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yyy2wREz6crOkIWlGJV7eapzuLC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
