A 60-year-old woman (the filmmaker) confronts over consumption and AI-fuelled misogynistic ageism with deadpan slapstick, a sculptural costume and an intricate, animated collage of bar-codes. A frenetic performance of striped, coded beings enmeshed in a system thatâ€™s of their own making, yet out of their control. Ambiguities and interference patterns are embraced, as is the contradiction of the toxic and the sublime, the comic and apocalyptic. Originally conceived as a live performance, this is a collaboration with composer Matt Rogers and The Something Puffs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IT IS WANTING","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2670704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennet Thomas","original_name":"Jennet Thomas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ef6b78e3ddd25e270961b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
