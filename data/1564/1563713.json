It features footage from several live gigs that Youth of Today played on their 1989 European tour along with a German interview that aired on regional television.  \"I organized and booked the Y.O.T. + Lethal Aggression DIY tour on my own and accompanied them as a driver. Three of my best sandbox friends accompanied me on the long 89 DIY tour as drivers and rowdies. It was a chaotic tour in many moments and a beautiful experience that I would not want to miss.  If I had actually produced, supported or released the Halter Skelter - Bootleg \"Live in Vienna\" or this \"European Tour Dokumentars - 1989\", at least I had spelled my name correctly. During the tour I had neither means nor possibilities to record or film the concerts. (In 1989 there were no iPhones yet!) \"Helter Skelter Records\" is not known to me either.\"","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/5MCdHb1UOq771zwlad15jPJQaQd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":277436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shining Life Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-10-17","revenue":89,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We're back!","title":"Youth of Today - European Tour Documentary from 1989","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Cappo","original_name":"Ray Cappo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0f86cbe6512b5ddad7da0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John 'Porcell' Porcelly","original_name":"John 'Porcell' Porcelly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/w7p5LY5QsU8uC96Hn8Is6U6eti5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0f87b0f3e6dde88a82e2a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1701904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Schreifels","original_name":"Walter Schreifels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0f893cdef0a1d751e20e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5752836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sami Siegler","original_name":"Sami Siegler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0f8ab3fdb45dcc85030dd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5752843,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martin Strothoff","original_name":"Martin Strothoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f0f911fd3b788e9ca82e73","department":"Crew","job":"Driver"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":756,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5MCdHb1UOq771zwlad15jPJQaQd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":264039,"name":"nyhc"},{"id":360450,"name":"youth of today"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"YOUTH OF TODAY - European Tour Documentary - 1989","key":"KZujz_f6B50","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-30T15:53:26.000Z","id":"68f0fa06b2c673b302ad7f0c"}]}}}
