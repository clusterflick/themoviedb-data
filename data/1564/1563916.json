Abandoned by his family, he finds support only in his brother, whom he asks to bury him under a viburnum tree so that birds will come and sing songs to him. Visually, the video contrasts with the song's content: instead of winter landscapes, the viewer sees a desert, sand, and hot colors that emphasize the themes of loneliness, mortality, and the illusory nature of the legacy that a person strives to leave behind. This is a work about alienation and the fragility of human life, but also about friendship and memory that unites across time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And the Snows Turned White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5753660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hordii Starukh","original_name":"Hordii Starukh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1592319710eb0156c6bd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bardak Film Fest","release_date":"2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
