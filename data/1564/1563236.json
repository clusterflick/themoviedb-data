Filmed in the forests and fjords surrounding Oslo, Norway, this film juxtaposes idyllic, untouched, “natural” landscapes with moments from my day to day life in the cityscape of Oslo and cyberspaces online in order to challenge notions of Norwegian romanticism and nationalism in relation to nature. Made by screenprinting iPhone footage and found videos onto strips of 16mm film with acrylic and bleach, then combining the screenprinted frames with 16mm filmed footage of Norwegian forests.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Where Are the Wild Things?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Clement","original_name":"Benjamin Clement","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68efc45f830f37f52e8a24f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
