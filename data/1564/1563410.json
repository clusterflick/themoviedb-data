A computer generated voice talks about the circle, square, triangle, line, and dot. Found footage and animation reflect the shapes. These shapes are also painted on her face, and she paints over them, one by one. When she is done, she dances towards a dark doorway, while animated shapes deconstruct, re-organizing themselves as stripes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7kn4LfbNjbDuZjHRaoKBcqgyrCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shape of Things to Come","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jen Liu","original_name":"Jen Liu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f01a999cded39b9c8a26ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1518,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7kn4LfbNjbDuZjHRaoKBcqgyrCa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1012}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
