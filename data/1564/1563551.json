Each day he descends the wall of an abandoned factory, covering its crumbling concrete with sweeping murals of mythic Mongolian landscapes. Watching him is a sardonic balloon, at once conscience, companion, and a stroke of fable. When officials announce the factory will soon be demolished, Bayaraa becomes determined to leave behind his masterpiece. Yet the deeper battle lies within: the long-buried wound of the wife and daughter he abandoned for art.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ханын зураач","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
