When Bart, the 28-year-old brother of filmmaker Koert Davidse, died of AIDS in 1986, silence surrounded both his illness and his coming out. Forty years later, Davidse revisits his brother’s free-spirited life through childhood memories, interviews, and Bart’s drawings and paintings. Once inseparable, the brothers drifted apart when Bart moved to Amsterdam—only to reconnect shortly before his death. In retracing this bond, Davidse bridges the gap between two lives and two cultures, crafting a deeply personal yet universal reflection on love, loss, and queer resilience amid a time of fear and change.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9jK3ICAFk5czYpxVrJPf82MUbXR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5751959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bep Mous","original_name":"Bep Mous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0284969b69a964a6c6769","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5751961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobbie Hamwijk","original_name":"Bobbie Hamwijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0285782c914a0c6389c19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5751962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Meijboom-Davidse","original_name":"Karin Meijboom-Davidse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68f02864d939188ec2c23c86","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882134,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Koert Davidse","original_name":"Koert Davidse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0287c7f873579cc502e81","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Thelosen","original_name":"Marc Thelosen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68f02887d58f304f2a502ec2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5751965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michiel Bollinger","original_name":"Michiel Bollinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68f0289c43142ab4aec23c7b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5751966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Verstraeten","original_name":"Paul Verstraeten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"68f028a775389795bda82b8e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5751967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilma Jobse-Davidse","original_name":"Wilma Jobse-Davidse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"68f028af8115aa6811502e89","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882134,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Koert Davidse","original_name":"Koert Davidse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f0281069b69a964a6c6755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"NL","iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/9jK3ICAFk5czYpxVrJPf82MUbXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
