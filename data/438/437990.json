A mysterious object. Following Jean Baudrillard's notion that the world has disappeared behind its own representation and it is therefore impossible to return to it, The Lost Object examines the complex mechanisms of how we perceive the constructed nature of reality and how this construction is achieved. In both the realms of our imagination and film. Fiction and reality merge into a single element.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/75geTI0EX7VMNR3pvkJKo4uK92a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Object","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastián Diaz Morales","original_name":"Sebastián Diaz Morales","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588e2850c3a368749400b8ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/75geTI0EX7VMNR3pvkJKo4uK92a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
