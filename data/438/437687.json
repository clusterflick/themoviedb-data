The actual filmic material related closely to that used by Gidal in previous films: hand-held shooting in domestic interiors, with tight framing, frequent zooms and re-focusing, aspires to a kind of 'pre-predicative' flux, in which full representation is held in abeyance. However, this material is now fragmented by the regular interruption of black leader, so that it appears as a series of discrete segments which are not, in any syntactic sense, shots - single takes clearly extend across more than one segment.","popularity":0.0698,"poster_path":"/9i3lWDpmKWQ3MbptIvYBf16E2zQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Partner","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Gidal","original_name":"Peter Gidal","popularity":0.1962,"profile_path":"/lQGQVPjd2LlxHHkgqNneNhYadUD.jpg","credit_id":"588bf6c1c3a36878460019cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9i3lWDpmKWQ3MbptIvYBf16E2zQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
