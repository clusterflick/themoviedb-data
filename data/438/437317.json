The parameters were simple: shoot a single 100 feet roll of black and white 16mm film. They were then strung together with black film separating the rolls, as Peter often separated the single shots in his films.It is a series of pieces that speak to Peter’s strong contemplative aesthetic ethos. Each filmmaker has 2 and half minutes of screen time to commune with Peter’s memory, and the collected rolls will become more than the sum of their parts.","popularity":0.1281,"poster_path":"/RTSn3gFrpgqJbVCVKLtKcjx0wM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Roll for Peter","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Burckhardt","original_name":"Jacob Burckhardt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5889348e92514163060164ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Theise","original_name":"Eric Theise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588934a4c3a36859ec014565","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1745347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolas Jaeger","original_name":"Nikolas Jaeger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588934b6925141685400b7c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Rose","original_name":"Peter Rose","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lwlkPk8RfTL8UtaX0JzwYJC72Pe.jpg","credit_id":"588934c5c3a368409300d5a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eve Heller","original_name":"Eve Heller","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/vowyir3HHg8GNMNd31OPcslxotp.jpg","credit_id":"588934dcc3a36859e90153ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/RTSn3gFrpgqJbVCVKLtKcjx0wM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
