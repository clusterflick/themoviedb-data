In his frustration Jacob stumbles onto another path to achieve his goals. Turning to the dark arts Jacob conjures the demon Mephistopheles and is given the key to eternal life. But his perceptions of 'life eternal' and the nature of his existence comes into question once he has obtained his desire for true knowledge.  Base in equal parts on the Faustian archetype and the biographical story of Dr. Albert Hoffmann's accidental discovery of LSD, The Philosopher's Stone is an homage to early German Expressionist cinema and the psychedelic visualizations of drug culture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Subliminal Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Philosopher's Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Andrew Myers","original_name":"Jacob Andrew Myers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jacob Fausstman","credit_id":"59a2e015c3a36847f60426a3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877853,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raymond Salvatore Harmon","original_name":"Raymond Salvatore Harmon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a2dfe7c3a368481e042c0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877853,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raymond Salvatore Harmon","original_name":"Raymond Salvatore Harmon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a2dfdec3a36847f604265e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1337016","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
