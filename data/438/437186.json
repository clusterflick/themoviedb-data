The victims were three girl scouts, between the ages of 8 and 10, who were raped and murdered. Their bodies had been left on a trail leading to the showers, about 150 yards from their tent at summer camp. The case was classified as solved when Gene Leroy Hart, a local jail escapee with a history of violence, was arrested. However, he was acquitted when he stood trial for the crime.","popularity":0.4564,"poster_path":"/A1VmKUizEdlGZV5ESopMtlYDsqB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barrister Productions Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Girl Scout Murders","title":"Someone Cry for the Children: The Girl Scout Murders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691538,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lindsay Armstrong","original_name":"Lindsay Armstrong","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Child (voice)","credit_id":"62c60e3dd207f3004fb63619","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3614280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trisha Bicknell","original_name":"Trisha Bicknell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Child (voice)","credit_id":"62c60e49956658004c66a5bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3614281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Bowles","original_name":"Larry Bowles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself - Retired OSBI Agent","credit_id":"62c60e5d447f9c004e4914da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Cash","original_name":"Johnny Cash","popularity":0.6074,"profile_path":"/8vIbqfss0GYh0ZgnfwE1ynzea6c.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"62c60e6dc1606a02daf9b531","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wilkerson","original_name":"Michael Wilkerson","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c60e21956658004c66a59a","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3614279,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Wilkerson","original_name":"Dick Wilkerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c60e2bcf62cd004e6bafc5","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wilkerson","original_name":"Michael Wilkerson","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4e21659a3c490012363863","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5912102","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A1VmKUizEdlGZV5ESopMtlYDsqB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
