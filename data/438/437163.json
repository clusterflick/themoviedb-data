A sexual orgy symbolizing the decadance of modern society. Maas, who acts in this film, plays the devil while a wild orgy goes on in his living-room. There is the fantastic drag queen doing her job in the bathroom while frenzied love-making, to the incomparable baroque-jazz music of Tiji Ito, is carried on in Maas's baroque apartment. The camera in bird-swift flight depicts a scene of total decadence as Andy Warhol's Jackie Kennedy careens through the air. By way of explanation: the opening scene shows the director handing out masks to the actors-the same ones used in LSD WALL by John Hawkins. The taking of LSD was part of the original script.","popularity":0.0756,"poster_path":"/i9YVTGRLgv7AqeT9R2BXmpjhzdU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orgia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willard Maas","original_name":"Willard Maas","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/cdUt2AjkaTJAMdQovoAr6WlQVn6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"651b9939c50ad2014dcee91d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willard Maas","original_name":"Willard Maas","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/cdUt2AjkaTJAMdQovoAr6WlQVn6.jpg","credit_id":"5887e640c3a36859e900516e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2061769","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9YVTGRLgv7AqeT9R2BXmpjhzdU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Film-Makers' Cinematheque","release_date":"1967-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
