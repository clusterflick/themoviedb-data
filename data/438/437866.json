Things get interesting when the nephews' bizarro invention starts bringing visitors from other times, including Napoleon, Archimedes, and people from the future and cavemen from the past. Just when they are filming what they are convinced will be one of the greatest movies ever, the same machine sends an alien visitor to their set. Also includes a last-minute cameo from James Coburn, as the infuriated head of the studio.","popularity":1.038,"poster_path":"/exb2lcA3n0cdyzrNc0nCrL53BvS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sorepark S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":85932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showscan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call from Space","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlton Heston","original_name":"Charlton Heston","popularity":2.5953,"profile_path":"/mJabHWZrjlFiF8U8Bbr8lSFtLX6.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Alien (voice)","credit_id":"588d42aec3a3681c150099a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Coburn","original_name":"James Coburn","popularity":3.7657,"profile_path":"/9GApjInyrVvjnTAr652C1aViPqZ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Studio Boss","credit_id":"588d42849251410a3f00a6ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdy Mayne","original_name":"Ferdy Mayne","popularity":0.3111,"profile_path":"/7l73nDzdFBae78sEaY4xWxEmRV4.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Archimedes","credit_id":"588d42c0925141234e003293","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Campbell","original_name":"Billy Campbell","popularity":0.9489,"profile_path":"/hMNmtQK3a6mqIQRyXn9G5bbheJV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Young Man","credit_id":"588d4272c3a3681c02009bb1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1227703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherrié Austin","original_name":"Sherrié Austin","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":"/j3APTq4u5mBrFjiZsxpoT1zByCa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jacqueline","credit_id":"588d421cc3a3681c190091b2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Brestoff","original_name":"Richard Brestoff","popularity":0.217,"profile_path":"/crtmyBM10zJfz0XkwWk2BZhvw81.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Movie Director","credit_id":"588d42469251410a3900aa9c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":156768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Gladstone","original_name":"Dana Gladstone","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/wdeW7xcz8SFLmHU8275zOvtrQZj.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Napoleon","credit_id":"588d429bc3a3681c1500998b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1746801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Stirling Baker","original_name":"Brandon Stirling Baker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cave Baby","credit_id":"588d42339251410a3d00a7dd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1746802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
