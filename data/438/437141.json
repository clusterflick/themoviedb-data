As a novelty, Starrett not only plays Durango and his \"alter ego\" Steve Drake, but also takes on a third identity, that of a hired gun in the employ of the film's bad guys. As one critic noted, this may be the only western in which the hero is obliged to chase himself. Jock O'Mahoney -- later known as Jock Mahoney -- plays a secondary role, and also doubles for Starrett during the riskier stunt sequences.","popularity":0.698,"poster_path":"/31KEXP8XDY3DFsVPRR9t7MhIDTo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BLASTING A BOGUS VIGILANTE GANG!","title":"Texas Dynamo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Starrett","original_name":"Charles Starrett","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/7DhidPyO8Z3regVeobzhRcbqlZT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Steve Drake / Durango Kid","credit_id":"5887d308c3a36859f30042b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Smiley Burnette","original_name":"Smiley Burnette","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/hfwpyujboZDjvsEqOEBxT5vJ9U5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Smiley Burnette","credit_id":"5887d315c3a36859e9004139","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lois Hall","original_name":"Lois Hall","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/AnkWfPkYSF24XQo4BONFWz8UsCQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julia Beck","credit_id":"5887d32292514162ed0042d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jock Mahoney","original_name":"Jock Mahoney","popularity":0.3644,"profile_path":"/2OZfov2M2v393PQUyTgqEiPYkgx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bill Beck","credit_id":"5887d330c3a36859f000407a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Duncan","original_name":"Slim Duncan","popularity":0.0849,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Slim Duncan","credit_id":"5887d33c92514163030040bf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dehner","original_name":"John Dehner","popularity":1.1683,"profile_path":"/gtirwewik38UEvbylveR4c7EmgU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stanton","credit_id":"5887d34992514162fa003f48","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Kroger","credit_id":"5887d355c3a36859f30042e7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Barton","original_name":"Gregg Barton","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/tX7s7D1M06mujjiEuvHSImSwIiG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"5887d36292514162fd0040a4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Bradford","original_name":"Marshall Bradford","popularity":0.1017,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Walt Beck","credit_id":"5887d370c3a36859e2003eed","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred F.
