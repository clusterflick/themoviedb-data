Years later Francis, his wife Aissey and 12-year-old daughter Haila await the birth of a son, who to Francis' excitement and Haila's irritation is immediately regarded as the worthy heir to the Desrances name. As the birth looms, civil war erupts in Abidjan and amidst the melee Aissey goes missing. Haila courageously steps forward in ways that challenge her father's notion of what constitutes a rightful heir. Cementing her status as a bold voice in contemporary filmmaking, Apolline Traoré's domestic drama escalates into an intense thriller that mounts a passionate challenge to commonly-held gender roles, whilst also highlighting the human cost of civil strife.","popularity":0.1608,"poster_path":"/1RcLqUsaBpgDMvL7kkhONaZdQ8l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123433,"logo_path":"/asgMs55sZGZYsQ5zOmjSjDofMJ3.png","name":"Les Films
