In 1978, Nobel Science Prize winners Pjotr Kapitsa, Arno Penzias, Hamilton O. Smith, Peter D. Mitchell and Werner Arber were filmed in a Stockholm TV studio talking with Bengt Feldreich about fossil fuels, nuclear reactors, genetics, the nature of time and symmetry. My version is a flicker film comprised solely of the Finnish subtitles that were played during the original broadcast. The film runs in a rapid loop, emulating the effect of a Tibetan prayer wheel.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2011-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man and Science","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Taanila","original_name":"Mika Taanila","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/aRinEE11qPBWRhoDWKnRvqiXjXd.jpg","credit_id":"5d6cab25efcea900119b1336","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2285505","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
