Replacing heroic cops with struggling, psychologically damaged characters, Wambaugh changed crime literature forever. Richard Fleischer’s filming of Wambaugh’s novel, also called THE NEW CENTURIONS, followed a year later and, in turn, revolutionized crime movies. Featuring newly filmed interviews with writer Joseph Wambaugh, star Stacy Keach, technical advisor Richard E. Kalk (Wambaugh’s real-life LAPD partner) and assistant cameraman Ronald Vidor, COP STORIES: THE MAKING OF RICHARD FLEISCHER’S THE NEW CENTURIONS chronicles the production of that landmark film in all its stages from script to screen.","popularity":0.5135,"poster_path":"/1r0mJK8blxWbS2GeNTxyDnBsoQH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fiction FACTory Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cop Stories: The Making of Richard Fleischer’s ‘The New Centurions’","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":165303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Wambaugh","original_name":"Joseph Wambaugh","popularity":0.1818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d69c3337776f0001072e7f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacy Keach","original_name":"Stacy Keach","popularity":1.6615,"profile_path":"/pxD1jmx9oAaV2lCLr87G3zRGv6i.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d69c33b9d8939001000587c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard E.
