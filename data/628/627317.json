My dad has spent thirty years alone at sea fishing lobster. He was taught the trade by his dad, who learnt from his dad. A heritage pasted down from father to son. My father never got a son, only daughters and since I was a girl no one assumed I was interested. After I turned eighteen I left Sweden and moved to Australia. After a decade abroad I started to long for home. I return to the island to see if I have it in me, can I learn the things I was never taught as a child? Will the legacy fade with me or can I become the family's next lobster fisherman? /Karolin Axelsson","popularity":0.215,"poster_path":"/u50XkW0u5m31V0Ff47KdJhlqxww.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67256,"logo_path":"/nU1s0hj1y1Hhxy8I0fXic0Up3Od.png","name":"Mediabruket","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2018-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a documentary about heritage, knots and open oceans","title":"The Last in a Line of Fishermen","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karolin Axelsson","original_name":"Karolin Axelsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d698389bdd5680014bb136a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Axelsson","original_name":"Kenneth Axelsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d698399713ed4000ff2692b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karolin Axelsson","original_name":"Karolin Axelsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d69832a343430000e1df935","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399876,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Johanna Becker","original_name":"Johanna Becker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d698352343430000e1df959","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karolin Axelsson","original_name":"Karolin Axelsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d698334bdd5680015bb1520","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karolin Axelsson","original_name":"Karolin Axelsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d698343343430000e1df94a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8769804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1815,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u50XkW0u5m31V0Ff47KdJhlqxww.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1210}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":1495,"name":"fishing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
