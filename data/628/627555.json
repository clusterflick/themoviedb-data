Three realities spiral together as a woman sacrifices everything attempting to escape the labyrinth, fighting to become the master of her consciousness.  A twisting triptych of narratives spirals together a contemporary metaphor, exploring the dark night of the soul. The themes of imprisonment by technology, torture, sacrifice we make for our material reality. Self empowerment, rebirth, naked and bloody as a warrior within fights to escape.  The ‘Triskelion’ is a maze-like symbol of three interlocking spirals, the film structure moves in a similar way, connected at the centre through the characters journey, whilst evolving as three narrative layers pull the story into a spiral. Each of the themes drift towards their own end whilst forming a complete visual puzzle at the climax.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7fwLrUEkNUUrnggQbW5mOv1i0Nd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triskelion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541951,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stuart Birchall","original_name":"Stuart Birchall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6aeb17549dda00157dc213","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7fwLrUEkNUUrnggQbW5mOv1i0Nd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
