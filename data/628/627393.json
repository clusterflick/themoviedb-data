This tsunami included street protests against misogynistic hate crimes, political campaigning in the upcoming presidential elections, protests against sexism and sexual violence in everyday life, and the ‘black’ protests calling for the abolition of the anti-abortion law. The Fearless And Vulnerable focuses on the activities and members of the Feminist Party (known in Korean as “Femidangdang”), a feminist group that was part of this tsunami wave. The pleasure and sincerity with which they conduct their activities are compounded with their courage in the face of conflict, and the sense of fear that permeates the community. The film shows Femidangdang meetings as well as the daily lives and thoughts of members during their activities post-2016.","popularity":0.2209,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fearless and Vulnerable","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Gomperts","original_name":"Rebecca Gomperts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6a11880929f6001645374b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2400210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam Soon-a","original_name":"Nam Soon-a","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b4f58d7d55040040ecd72a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2400204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeon Sungyeon","original_name":"Jeon Sungyeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6a12320929f60014453e45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2400204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeon Sungyeon","original_name":"Jeon Sungyeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6a12fb7776f0000f736b1a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2400209,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"OH Cheonseok","original_name":"OH Cheonseok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6a131b9d8939001300d545","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2400204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeon Sungyeon","original_name":"Jeon Sungyeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6a13517776f0000f736b84","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":11718,"name":"feminist"},{"id":208647,"name":"activist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"Seoul International Women's Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
