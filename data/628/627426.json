They are surrounded by silhouettes motionless and tense. In parallel in a sanitized white space, these two men face each other at a distance. They seem to have the power to influence the behavior of the other. Their violent and fierce manipulations quickly blow them to the limit of the knockout. This struggle has the effect of animating the individuals around them in the dark space. Alain Chamfort is the link between these two spaces. He is the witness and the narrator. He walks in the dark towards a ray of light. In the air there are particles that gradually draw a yellow landscape, a chaotic exterior that indicates a post-apocalyptic era. A child appears in the distance through the yellowish fog. He walks in the midst of a group of women and men of all ages walking in the same direction, looking out at the horizon of a new land.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/wen6IVS1YK0gLEBRN5asWBWbOF1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The whole history of humanity, is in each of us.","title":"Linoleum - Alain Chamfort/Cie Niki Noves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2400324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niki Noves","original_name":"Niki Noves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6a4cfd0929f60014458d17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10745590","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wen6IVS1YK0gLEBRN5asWBWbOF1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"[MAKING OF] Alain Chamfort - Linoléum / par la Compagnie Niki Noves","key":"sVQMB9IUELI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-14T07:53:01.000Z","id":"5d6a4d6e0929f60015458256"}]}}}
