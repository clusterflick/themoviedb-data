The film is divided into two parts. Part 1 is about the conflicts of married female office workers who suffer from undertaking office work, housework, and childcare all at the same time. Part 2 focuses on single female workers who break away from being the traditional ‘flower of the company,’ and develop a greater sense of autonomy as they actively participate in forming a labor union.","popularity":0.0689,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Even Little Grass Has Its Own Name","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byun Young-joo","original_name":"변영주","popularity":0.3471,"profile_path":"/tsJHdphVtZkq4bA3LJR5i1Ga42U.jpg","credit_id":"5d6cefb365686e5b9b893f5e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1854846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim So-young","original_name":"Kim So-young","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":"/5EhaZj9R6Hkaw1fbspx0tXniEWH.jpg","credit_id":"5d6ced4520ecaf00132a0a5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byun Young-joo","original_name":"변영주","popularity":0.3471,"profile_path":"/tsJHdphVtZkq4bA3LJR5i1Ga42U.jpg","credit_id":"5e4c2f7e9b86160016663939","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
