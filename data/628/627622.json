With nearly a million followers, Em embraces the idea that millennials are the true hustlers and makes money any way she can, while Mouse, a 35-year-old boxer, serves as her driver and de-facto- bodyguard. The pair’s mutually-beneficial partnership allows Em a degree of safety and gives Mouse much-needed income as he pushes along his looming asylum application. As it becomes harder for the two to stay afloat, they soon realize that security might just come from each other.","popularity":0.2224,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"Life from the Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Schrader","original_name":"Paul Schrader","popularity":0.7513,"profile_path":"/ctRxgCUSRFudwFaPG2AanL71Y3V.jpg","credit_id":"5d6b443a549dda1cba7df0f1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257795,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Bradley Bredeweg","original_name":"Bradley Bredeweg","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/viya7bdfpI2IcPArS7hAwZ73hO6.jpg","credit_id":"5d6b448d65686e5b9b879a92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257795,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Bradley Bredeweg","original_name":"Bradley Bredeweg","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/viya7bdfpI2IcPArS7hAwZ73hO6.jpg","credit_id":"5d6b445865686e3e7987c471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10928692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
