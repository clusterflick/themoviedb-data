The Oklahoma coach and the linebacker he recruited to play for him were both out-sized personalities who delighted in thumbing their noses at the establishment. And in their three seasons together (1984-86), the unique father-son dynamic resulted in 31 wins and two Orange Bowl victories as Bosworth was awarded the first two Butkus Awards. But then Bosworth's alter ego: \"The Boz,\" took over both their lives and ultimately destroyed their careers. In \"Brian and The Boz,\" Bosworth looks back on the mistakes he made and passes on the lessons he learned to his son. It's a revealing portrait of a man who had and lost it all, and a trip back to a time when enough just wasn't enough.","popularity":0.6198,"poster_path":"/3pbJrlJ8BTpH9rw809DZUYYph0t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He made every tackle, but he couldn't stop himself","title":"Brian and the Boz","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bosworth","original_name":"Brian Bosworth","popularity":0.558,"profile_path":"/4QC8xKpQSGNVq5MbufGFU36EIZG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"547b350292514137a8000846","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Ross","original_name":"Jim Ross","popularity":0.3404,"profile_path":"/ufuTblMtz0xBknpRIQm1k0U6Qf5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6441661bcee2f6044b3576d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1231488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Switzer","original_name":"Barry Switzer","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6441668fcee2f604753574c4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thaddeus D.
