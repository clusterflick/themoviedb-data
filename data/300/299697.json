Placed in separate orphanges run by the Catholic Church, each was told the others were dead. The resulting traumas affected each of them deeply and for life.  'In A House That Ceased To Be' offers a glimpse into Christina’s personal life, her love of children and the hardships of Mongolia and Viet Nam where she chooses to work. It is also an unflinching portrayal of her pain and her sense of betrayal by Ireland, the country in which she and her siblings were born, raised and ultimately torn apart.","popularity":0.1583,"poster_path":"/1o5N0tb6RRP2e79lIa6TIajn1jx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In a House that Ceased to Be","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ciarín Scott","original_name":"Ciarín Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5450ef82c3a368532b0044c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Duane","original_name":"Paul Duane","popularity":0.1466,"profile_path":"/1ARJpI5TlOdDOaaKYJDv0UwZdRe.jpg","credit_id":"5450efa20e0a263a1000449d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3974390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1986,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1o5N0tb6RRP2e79lIa6TIajn1jx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1332}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
