It shows the exterior of the house where he was hiding during a nationwide manhunt and re-enacts scenes of the landlady informing on him and his arrest. The film has no explanatory titles, so presumably audiences would have known, or were told, the story.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/gCvhrxegONRuK91LPb9TQxz89sq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitchell & Kenyon","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1901-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arrest of Goudie","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13838092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gCvhrxegONRuK91LPb9TQxz89sq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1901-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arrest of Goudie (1901) Mitchell & Kenyon","key":"hkMwkyaPw54","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-25T02:32:47.000Z","id":"6524b9ab07216645b51bb04a"}]}}}
