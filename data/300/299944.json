One guy, who she nick-names \"Bristlelip\" makes a deal with her father for her hand. The next day \"Bristlelip\" comes disguised as a peddler, and the girl becomes his unwilling bride. He carries her off to his crude cabin, all the while commenting on her questions about properties. The girl proves to be an unfit (at housework) wife at first, trying her hand at cooking, spinning, basketry, and even sales of pottery to no avail.","popularity":0.3922,"poster_path":"/7lxlo8k40QVOxFkSvQ1cSe0TTdh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bristlelip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veanne Cox","original_name":"Veanne Cox","popularity":0.4433,"profile_path":"/nKO4vwztjH353FvGR2fg002UJx7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Haughty Princess","credit_id":"5e3de23d98f1f100120d8ae5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Marshall","original_name":"Sarah Marshall","popularity":0.2668,"profile_path":"/1HW2RF9ZywXM12I6Kfla9KoTIWd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kitchen maid","credit_id":"679ccdd9f7cfe3476e4d182d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Carroll","original_name":"Robert Carroll","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bristlelip","credit_id":"679cce15f7cfe3476e4d1847","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676591,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Davenport","original_name":"Tom Davenport","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3de2539603310017ea6187","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0388794","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7lxlo8k40QVOxFkSvQ1cSe0TTdh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
