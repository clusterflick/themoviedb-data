Nora's uncle Eberhard, however, believes the two belong together and comes up with a plan to bring the two back together again: as a lawyer, who is processing the divorce, he explains to them that the paperwork for the divorce is completed, but will only go into effect once they undertake a reconciliation attempt. For the first reconciliation meeting, Eberhard enlists the help of his friend Christa and together, they turn Nora into such a hot tamale, that Peter burns with jealousy that any other man might look at her. At the second meeting of the two, which takes place a year later (how long do divorces in Nazi Germany take?!?!), Nora plays the girl abandoned by everyone. In the interim, she's given birth to Peter's son -- which apparently does not count as a reconciliation -- and Peter has become a successful composer. When Nora again disappears after this meeting, Peter does all he can to win her back.","popularity":0.2103,"poster_path":"/y2To5o3oFAyCGDxH5sBzgCVE0nR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1939-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ehe in Dosen","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leny Marenbach","original_name":"Leny Marenbach","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":"/2V7LdlF6mhmTuYH4wS0NfvX2onZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nora Bagrat","credit_id":"5452366a0e0a263a04006b6e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grethe Weiser","original_name":"Grethe Weiser","popularity":0.1717,"profile_path":"/8kKcaXNgP3VURAnJ69OFoPvpC53.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mausi Blanke","credit_id":"545236790e0a263a180066c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilde Hildebrand","original_name":"Hilde Hildebrand","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/rIgDCiVHLIRG7czA4aVqpyj0Sok.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Frau Conradi","credit_id":"545236890e0a2601d8006575","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Platte","original_name":"Rudolf Platte","popularity":0.3465,"profile_path":"/6N9uS2IfJFFOdHANNw762ranr3C.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Karl, Diener bei Bagrat","credit_id":"545236980e0a2639fe006a1e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Riemann","original_name":"Johannes Riemann","popularity":0.2316,"profile_path":"/46LG5vuLB9TZ3ltgu0Oo6MtCUfI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Peter Bagrat, Komponist","credit_id":"545236f1c3a368023c006674","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhard Dammann","original_name":"Gerhard Dammann","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":"/1QFBCnSNJH6dpt1BamdreIxSo9P.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Briefträger","credit_id":"545237010e0a2639fe006a29","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Arthur Roberts","original_name":"Ralph Arthur Roberts","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":"/9T8chF4Sa1uwW1Eab1p8a22ewy0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Justizrat Windhorst","credit_id":"5b5850d49251416dcf04b56c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilde Weissner","original_name":"Hilde Weissner","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/8kD5y1WqmlNZ53CKYGUeZGkTzyO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Christa Andersen","credit_id":"5b5850e40e0a2673cd04c494","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willi Schur","original_name":"Willi Schur","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/zb4YcT0DRR3xHaby2iQH4xIGypt.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Toby","credit_id":"5b5850f20e0a2673cd04c4a1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelo Ferrari","original_name":"Angelo Ferrari","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/lD433MCsszP7j0Hf8Fpf7MXdEn5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"2.
