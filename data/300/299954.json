Tracing the origins of his work, American painter Fonseca reveals that his singular forms are not merely summoned from the imagination, but are also inherited from a deep and personal lineage of artists. Through his humor and self-examination, Fonseca shows us that colors and forms can reveal a man's history and character, reminding us that the work of an artist is not simply a reflection of life, but the essence of life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painter: Caio Fonseca","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2137197","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
