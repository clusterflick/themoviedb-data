There is a dispute between Bobby's two siblings, Nanni and Johannes, as to whom could give Bobby a better home. Nanni and her husband Klaus would offer a “normal” family environment, but Klaus is only after the money. Johannes really wants to take care of Bobby and give him a home for the future. The problem is  he is gay and lives with his partner Marc. The responsible offices don't like that at all. Only when the matter goes to court, do the parties to the dispute realize that this is mainly about Bobby's will and that he can actually best decide who he would like to live with in the future.","popularity":0.3575,"poster_path":"/q84EroTDxBVEOrT0vk8jWz7pFn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":425,"logo_path":null,"name":"teamWorx","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobby","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Mon Petit Frere A Besoin De Nous","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Brederlow","original_name":"Bobby Brederlow","popularity":0.1631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bobby","credit_id":"544ceabcc3a36872d8002362","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Ferres","original_name":"Veronica Ferres","popularity":0.4875,"profile_path":"/coHFoFuANZyDaIUBuJoOeSgGEKl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rosi","credit_id":"544ceac8c3a36872b80021c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Knüfken","original_name":"Markus Knüfken","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":"/1OI4tuTCIRbyDeVPK9MJrCSUiZi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jojo","credit_id":"544cead60e0a2608d40020f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffen Groth","original_name":"Steffen Groth","popularity":0.2879,"profile_path":"/aCnDc7h32pjENQiJJULLyc0VJ0d.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marc","credit_id":"544ceaf3c3a36872cc001ed2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hansa Czypionka","original_name":"Hansa Czypionka","popularity":0.3528,"profile_path":"/aiG4yZV7f93IQaiZCXA2vvbv0uj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Klaus Wilde","credit_id":"544ceb040e0a2608d40020fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margret Völker","original_name":"Margret Völker","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nanni Wilde","credit_id":"544ceb16c3a36872bc0022a2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"August Schmölzer","original_name":"August Schmölzer","popularity":0.3796,"profile_path":"/uyLd4JmKBM7errLfAvRkYCTvUXB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rechtspfleger Ettschläger","credit_id":"544ceb330e0a2608d0002211","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karlheinz Hackl","original_name":"Karlheinz Hackl","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/aqqDUEEiCr88VCtixRjJaHMFOmg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gutachter","credit_id":"544ceb710e0a2608cd00216f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raidar Müller-Elmau","original_name":"Raidar Müller-Elmau","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Richter","credit_id":"5a6fb54e9251413754004d07","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivian Naefe","original_name":"Vivian Naefe","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544ceaafc3a36872b400224b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0303781","wikidata_id":"Q888429","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wDPXSCcG9EQ8oNKHPmhJce5YAj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/sdvsfc7jpq1n0fVqvaaZH5PKUZd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2zNslZzW5QkUg4NVX3kLlNsEvwJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q84EroTDxBVEOrT0vk8jWz7pFn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
