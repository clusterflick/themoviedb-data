The women of N Street Village - a community for addiction recovery - have never performed on stage in their lives. Yet, guided by teachers from the Theater Lab School of the Dramatic Arts, they discover their untapped artistic talents and reckon with their traumatic histories. Courage is found; a leap of faith is taken. Sharing their pasts to release the potential in their futures, these 15 emboldened women take the stage in front of a packed house, illuminating the transformative power of arts education.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":"/xCActNSDCkSkqEjrGiOeBCw7h3h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can telling your story save your life?","title":"How I Got Over","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147953,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Boxer","original_name":"Nicole Boxer","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62924d7a7d5db510a732392d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1280039,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah E.
