Thanks to her tenacity to follow through on her \"\"intuition\"\", she soon has the entire precinct on her back. Her first case involves a fire in which the mother and daughters escape but the father dies. Susanne is convinced the man was murdered. Though she still has the support of her partner Weber, she puts everything on the line when she begins to investigate into similar cases that occurred in the past - against the will of her colleagues. With the help of former pathologist Gerit, Susanne discovers a trail of cover-ups and irregularities that ultimately lead her and Weber to the serial killer's lair. Before they can seize him, however, Susanne is knocked unconscious and Weber is shot with Susanne's gun. Suspected of attempted murder, she must now prove her innocence and catch the killer - the only way to prove to her colleagues that her instinct was dead right.","popularity":0.4391,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jagd
