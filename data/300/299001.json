Lupita's brother Emanuel pretends he's paralyzed so he can drink and gamble while the two women tend to the sheep. Lucifer senses an opportunity and plays the miraculous healer. He forces Emanuel to walk again, seduces Maria and makes Lupita doubt about her faith. He didn't bring bad luck, he only illuminated the line between good and evil, where it didn't exist before.","popularity":0.2555,"poster_path":"/inI9eJghVF9GMTbwezKDs6fGRX4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12583,"logo_path":"/vnYEkRJgZ9w1ZL777SGNqNV74b8.png","name":"Minds Meet","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mantarraya Producciones","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":22071,"logo_path":"/b3YwzlhTVkrcv1G6nl8XHJBidZk.png","name":"Mollywood","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":123481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peliculas Santa Clara","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2014-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucifer","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabino Rodríguez","original_name":"Gabino Rodríguez","popularity":0.2849,"profile_path":"/v6KGU3yxp0vjgpCGhmnA78IFp9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lucifer","credit_id":"544b981bc3a3680fb4006e98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Pablo","original_name":"Norma Pablo","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":"/gEOxHbmMEt8uYMnCCKbNCFJzcJx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"544b9842c3a3680fa50068d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana María Acosta","original_name":"Ana María Acosta","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lupita","credit_id":"544b9852c3a3680fb100702e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeronimo Soto Bravo","original_name":"Jeronimo Soto Bravo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Emanuel","credit_id":"544b986e0e0a26748c006b0c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gust Van den Berghe","original_name":"Gust Van den Berghe","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544b973c0e0a2651b3001f05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gust Van den Berghe","original_name":"Gust Van den Berghe","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544b9746c3a36850a7000f2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tomas Leyers","original_name":"Tomas Leyers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544b97600e0a267489006b48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377439,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Bruch Jr.","original_name":"Hans Bruch Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544b979ec3a3686ac10008c2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210753,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Verdurme","original_name":"David Verdurme","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544b97abc3a3680fb8006cea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377440,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Natalia Trivino","original_name":"Natalia Trivino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544b97e6c3a3680fb8006cf9","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4131206","wikidata_id":"Q18396969","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sTDdEu2XpYXHSyea8QjY7sRb20e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMKd5M0ZYH2rRo6iaA6wtkKhbLO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/inI9eJghVF9GMTbwezKDs6fGRX4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"jyEauZShW_E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-06-07T10:12:53.000Z","id":"653aa5542811a100ea08768c"}]}}}
