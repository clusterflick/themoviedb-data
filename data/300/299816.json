Set in the sun-drenched coastal landscape of Macuto, where the artist lived in near isolation, the film captures his eccentric lifestyle and unique creative process. Through evocative imagery and a contemplative narrative, Reverón explores his deep connection to nature, his experiments with light and texture, and his profound artistic genius. This seminal work stands as a tribute to one of Venezuela’s most influential painters and a landmark in Latin American documentary filmmaking.","popularity":0.0795,"poster_path":"/9PycLT3uRZB3gpebun674cokKy7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caroni Films C.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverón","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4938253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Augusto León","original_name":"Carlos Augusto León","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrador","credit_id":"66e2cc3b28048d92def8f07a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armando Reverón","original_name":"Armando Reverón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67a3397073542082b69fd0fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5227000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juanita Mota","original_name":"Juanita Mota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67a33b6eaeee5c0e259fdba5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937722,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margot Benacerraf ","original_name":"Margot Benacerraf","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/hG6hCmBnFOFmhQYNRfiC3X91DJs.jpg","credit_id":"559fe278c3a3680d5600019a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937722,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margot Benacerraf ","original_name":"Margot Benacerraf","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/hG6hCmBnFOFmhQYNRfiC3X91DJs.jpg","credit_id":"559fe28fc3a3680d600001a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301673,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Bernard","original_name":"Guy Bernard","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/vYhPe1XIc6Nx0vgixdYgpkTmJk9.jpg","credit_id":"66e2cbd10000000000b9241f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4938250,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boris Doroslovacki","original_name":"Boris Doroslovacki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e2cbec0000000000b9242d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498977,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francine Grubert","original_name":"Francine Grubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e2cc08f467c2ad62f8f2e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937722,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margot Benacerraf ","original_name":"Margot Benacerraf","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/hG6hCmBnFOFmhQYNRfiC3X91DJs.jpg","credit_id":"66e2cc160000000000b91ded","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0180962","wikidata_id":"Q106313853","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8W4bHVS7YzUEfGOlobVosKMJks6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/raMe4jyPYCoNaAk8nZyh6E8fY9O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9PycLT3uRZB3gpebun674cokKy7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":346766,"name":"venezuelan art"},{"id":346767,"name":"latin american art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://milestone.vhx.tv/checkout/reveron/purchase","release_date":"1952-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
