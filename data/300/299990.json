He fears self-censorship is yet to be undone as \"people have created their own prisons.\" Elsewhere in Cairo, street art is burgeoning in a joyful expression of freedom. \"It's the first time that I walk past things like these that express happiness and contentment\", an old man explains, smiling. Karima Mansour is a choreographer whose dance expresses the complexities of a society in which there are veiled women, \"but we also have women like me. I am a dancer working with the body.\" She now wants access to state-run theatres, something forbidden to independent artists under the old regime.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Noise of Cairo","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2145478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
