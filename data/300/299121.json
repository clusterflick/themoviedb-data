The rest that follows is his dream. The four band members become conductors on a train filled with characters and (impersonated) actors from the 1930s, such as W.C. Fields, Dracula, and Scarlett O'Hara. Various songs are featured. The singing conductors are obliged to solve a mystery; Marlon Brando is murdering Nelson Eddy, Jeanette McDonald and others by suffocating them in his armpits. A wacky funeral, a fight with a gorilla, and the threat of being turned into a wax museum figure are all part of Harry's dream.","popularity":0.7487,"poster_path":"/jdC49oqx8SsUq3JHclKG6QVLthY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Billy Jack Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":36360,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crystal Jukebox Film Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Featuring BLOODSTONE","title":"Train Ride to Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3845312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willis Draffen Jr.","original_name":"Willis Draffen Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63a908d9e4b57600a0520c3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3845315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Love","original_name":"Charles Love","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63a9090d0f21c600ca787169","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3845316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles McCormick","original_name":"Charles McCormick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63a9091ca6a4c1007def9708","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3845317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Williams","original_name":"Harry Williams","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63a9093ea6a4c100c8e62a22","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1546050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Payne","original_name":"Michael Payne","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Producer / Eric","credit_id":"63a90959e4b57600dbea2575","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Marks","original_name":"Guy Marks","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Humphrey Bogart","credit_id":"63a9096ba6a4c1008a84407f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Robinson","original_name":"Jay Robinson","popularity":0.4931,"profile_path":"/wB4jqYXCztqMoAdQanqpYiMSgZF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dracula","credit_id":"63a9097daaec7100bb4f16e0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Davis","original_name":"Phyllis Davis","popularity":0.4533,"profile_path":"/4eKwUoWSPW4PuMwIXwKWjNtnCcj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Scarlett O'Hara","credit_id":"63a90990238513007b1e0b71","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles R.
