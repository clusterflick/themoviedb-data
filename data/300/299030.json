Linda, the daughter of Baron Danning, is about to marry the rich manufacturer’s son, Walter Bertram, to save the Danning family estate from the Baron’s debtors.  But her encounter with Markus is creating doubts about the sincerity of her love for Walter.  So she keeps pushing back their wedding, using as a pretext the demand, that she’ll only marry when the now-silent church organ in the village once more plays.  But the organ builder Franz is in a dispute with his twin brother Joseph and has no time to fix the disused organ.","popularity":0.214,"poster_path":"/zOCKODBFzX5FsFBTOWRRfTzw0Kx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schönbrunn-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1961-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Orgelbauer von St. Marien","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hörbiger","original_name":"Paul Hörbiger","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/jrTXAidwAiHz5xW5M96uzvkTcDN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Franz Burgmann / Josef Burgmann","credit_id":"544bca150e0a2608d400016a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerlinde Locker","original_name":"Gerlinde Locker","popularity":0.2489,"profile_path":"/q7J9tSUUGYj9FcFgzekpXDtq0Ls.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Baroness Linda von Danning","credit_id":"544bca430e0a2608cd00019b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannelore Cremer","original_name":"Hannelore Cremer","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/flhgGoo8ArwKBxEdjJAHVC9xyhS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Petra Wührer","credit_id":"544bca590e0a2608c80001bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","original_name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/4hh5ZAV3C7FQ2g4SOngiVkWoiJq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Baron von Danning","credit_id":"544bca6b0e0a2608be0001b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sieghardt Rupp","original_name":"Sieghardt Rupp","popularity":0.2059,"profile_path":"/v7bfNqUN6HDXM1XX3Iu1ctdcv5A.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bruder Markus Burgmann","credit_id":"544bca7bc3a36872d8000196","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Eppler","original_name":"Dieter Eppler","popularity":0.2542,"profile_path":"/vfZbghEEbGi3Z0wGQxtNnl11UAR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Walter Bertram","credit_id":"544bca8b0e0a2608cd0001a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Direktor Bertram","credit_id":"544bcaae0e0a2608cd0001ae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1548543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franzl Lang","original_name":"Franzl Lang","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Leopold","credit_id":"58b00f92c3a3682d24009cfc","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49335,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"August Rieger","original_name":"August Rieger","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544bca000e0a2608c2000189","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482227,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Badal","original_name":"Alexander Badal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4ca6e9450fe0013241dd6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":48752,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Theodor Ottawa","original_name":"Theodor Ottawa","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4ca85d1a8930012769ef7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49335,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"August Rieger","original_name":"August Rieger","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4ca790486380012043ed3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0055265","wikidata_id":"Q1196091","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zOCKODBFzX5FsFBTOWRRfTzw0Kx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1961-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
