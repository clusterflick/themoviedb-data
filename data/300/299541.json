She delves into the past and is transported to the lives of her ancestors via dreamlike sequences that show the hopes and realities of her female relations over the course of an entire century. Heimat Fragments is an intoxicating trip into the lives of venerable characters from different periods in Lulu's family history, from long-forgotten scenes of war to every day family life on the farm. This gripping film shows fragments of the lives that shaped her own. Her gaze into the past does not simply signal the end of her youth, it means the beginning of a newly gained freedom.","popularity":0.3112,"poster_path":"/6CmkmNhLbJ2QeixqvYo3PGzvu2b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74658,"logo_path":null,"name":"ERF / Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heimat Fragments: The Women","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Schössler","original_name":"Nicola Schössler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d05c3a36829ab00946c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Arnold","original_name":"Henry Arnold","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d129251413d3900599e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salome Kammer","original_name":"Salome Kammer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d1d9251417254003ee5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caspar Arnhold","original_name":"Caspar Arnhold","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d2fc3a368673c0061c2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gudrun Landgrebe","original_name":"Gudrun Landgrebe","popularity":0.3357,"profile_path":"/uAjvVyC5dEpvYn4fBN5tlKrePuU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d3a9251417254003f01","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Richter","original_name":"Jörg Richter","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d43c3a36866fe005dbe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lesch","original_name":"Michael Lesch","popularity":0.44,"profile_path":"/7rZ9IxuqTa3SRMbQoSrn4llYHLg.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d4ac3a36829ab00949b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marita Breuer","original_name":"Marita Breuer","popularity":0.2046,"profile_path":"/dv6jHPrXhbJU20kgvIarAsT86Lm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d56c3a3682d8300407c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Schneider","original_name":"Peter Schneider","popularity":0.3594,"profile_path":"/f8s0gmEMafI2drpv5bb3fomZVFh.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"57960d629251412c1f009248","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Reitz","original_name":"Edgar Reitz","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":"/1i5hiMeElDm4LnYxIkdleFmKG4d.jpg","credit_id":"544fef34c3a3680236002581","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Steinbach","original_name":"Peter Steinbach","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57960ce4925141423900c2d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Brussig","original_name":"Thomas Brussig","popularity":0.2442,"profile_path":"/gtjg2MVRL26r59ApcDFxf4FerP5.jpg","credit_id":"57960cefc3a36829ab00945f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1611542,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Reitz","original_name":"Christian Reitz","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9ef17c3a36803930047ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0810894","wikidata_id":"Q1433301","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":905,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6CmkmNhLbJ2QeixqvYo3PGzvu2b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":603},{"aspect_ratio":0.737,"height":1766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5IdwtqdymCOTsezxZkxVmVYczg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1302}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
