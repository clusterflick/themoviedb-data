Left to the vivid imagination, fuelled by modern literary best- sellers like Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\", we all now look for hidden meanings in the documents of history, and Freemasonry with its fascinating symbolic imagery is a natural choice for the inquiring mind. There was a time, and not so long ago, when it was almost impossible to find out anything about the Freemasons, unless of course you became one, but with advancing technology it's possible to now successfully investigate the past of this elusive secret society.","popularity":0.0632,"poster_path":"/5KKb8ztXxgpEHVAi9ZvNs3uaGqe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freemasonry: Tracking the Code","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8894130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5KKb8ztXxgpEHVAi9ZvNs3uaGqe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
