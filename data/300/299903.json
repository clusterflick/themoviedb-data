Decades after Allen Merritt won the legendary Cat Cay Tuna Tournament eight times, commercial overharvesting and other factors have all but wiped out the bluefin population in these once teeming waters. Now Roy Merritt Jr. is on a quest to show the world - and his grandfather - that sport fishing has a future in Tuna Alley. But catching and releasing one of these 700+ pound elusive beasts won't be easy, and it has nothing to do with their size.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/zWGQfOiEt5TWZaU0fTXfi1a679g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bluefin on the Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zWGQfOiEt5TWZaU0fTXfi1a679g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
