Railroads traverse these mountains by way of scenic routes and steep grades. Put winter and railroads together, and the result is something special: mile long freight trains braving white flurries, passenger coaches on mountain excursions, and small operators battling the elements. This is a Western Winter Wonderland.  Featuring:  Stevens Pass, Marias Pass, Mullan Pass, Deer Lodge Pass, Canadian Rockies, Donner Pass, Shasta, McCloud, Pengra Pass, and Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad.","popularity":0.2672,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Western Winter Wonderland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2448,"name":"freight train"},{"id":209029,"name":"trainspotting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
