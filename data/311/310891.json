Diego, a wealthy landowner, secretly marries Amparo, defying her father Juan Manuel, who fiercely opposes the union. Juan Manuel still holds a grudge against Diego, having once been his employer when Diego was just a laborer. Their secret marriage stirs jealousy and resentment, particularly in Octavio, Diego’s servant, and his wife Laura, who harbors unspoken feelings for him.
