But there is something off about the general atmosphere of the loft, the city, the planet. You can sense this strangeness being present all the time. And Emilia´s and Ramiro's agreement to –not talk about it- is very clear. But it seems as if there is always something pushing them to bring up the subject. The Tongue of The Sun is a story of the end of our planet and how two ordinary people that live an extraordinary love generate the genesis needed to give the human race a new chance. In the mysterious alchemy that is love; lies the last hope that human beings have of transcending the inevitable end of the world.","popularity":0.2477,"poster_path":"/lOj3Lo6ok1njjunGseNd1qx09Gg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2017-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
