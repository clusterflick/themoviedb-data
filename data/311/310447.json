Medical tests have shown that he is ingesting too few calories and is suffering from calcium deficiency. He will also be 12 to 15 centimetres shorter than if he’d had ‘normal’ nutrition. The strict diet has isolated Tom. The demand for intervention is growing. The hospital reported the mother for child neglect. Tom and his mother were summoned to court. The mother has officially been charged with child neglect and psychological abuse. She has been ordered to adjust the diet. But Francis has no intention of changing her lifestyle. She remains a committed ‘raw foodist,’ and is supported by an American raw food guru. She believes she has her son’s best interests at heart.  In Rawer we see how the world reacts to Tom and his mother. Will the mother continue to challenge boundaries? Will the authorities intervene? And, what will adolescent Tom do?","popularity":0.0535,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rawer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anneloek Sollart","original_name":"Anneloek Sollart","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548a167792514161d3002471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2594654","wikidata_id":"Q2947916","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
