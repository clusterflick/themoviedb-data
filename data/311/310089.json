Determined to alter the present by changing the past, the pirates travel back to 1955 to construct the ultimate weapon: an Elvis Presley video-clone. Part sci-fi + rom com + biblical epic + action movie, this free-culture manifesto adopts the tactical responses of the parasite, feeding off the body of Hollywood and inhabiting its cinematic structures and codes. The unwitting all-star cast includes Elvis Presley, Charlton Heston, Monkey, Batman, Bette Davis, Jaws, Jesus, The Hulk, The Hoff and the Ghostbusters.","popularity":0.2649,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2006-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood Burn","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soda Jerk","original_name":"Soda Jerk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5488f7a292514161d50006ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Smith","original_name":"Sam Smith","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/61eh2k7eSOaHrkSU42kqEllPNLo.jpg","credit_id":"6021e5bb0e597b003da53707","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9020558","wikidata_id":"Q125182498","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12197,"name":"compilation"},{"id":33896,"name":"montage"},{"id":209207,"name":"free culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
