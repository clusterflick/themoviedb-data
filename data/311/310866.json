On that day, respected tobacco farmer Charlie Lawson brutally murdered his wife and 6 of his 7 children before committing suicide; the most horrible and mysterious mass murder in North Carolina history. The Lawson murders became immortalized in a classic bluegrass murder ballad, ghost stories, tours of the crime scene, and legends broadcast nationwide. But this southern documentary shows for the first time the true tragedy: the story of the families, the continuing effect it has on the community, and the tragedy of rural domestic violence.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/9Seow6Dvbmexrww7JfhXx9mNy3E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Christmas Family Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1414143","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Seow6Dvbmexrww7JfhXx9mNy3E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
