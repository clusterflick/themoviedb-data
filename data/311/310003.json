They brought in supplies, set up relief stations, and for ten months fed and cared for the recovery workers. Many deep and unexpected - even unlikely - relationships developed out of this. Using cinema verite footage, interviews and archival photographs, we follow several characters through a series of events reuniting them with each other after the closing of the site. Through their stories we present a portrait of the city within a city that was Ground Zero, and examine how an extremely diverse group of people transcended politics and culture in an effort to heal their city and themselves. 9/12: From Chaos to Community - a 60-minute character-driven documentary - is a vibrant, moving, sometimes funny, sometimes painful portrayal of hope and healing in the wake of disaster.","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":"/wuwLSkZEUGPVLMsLRbPWABFtQym.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/12: From Chaos to Community","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":201278,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susanna Styron","original_name":"Susanna Styron","popularity":0.0851,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2474238f26bc0011796e68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0952639","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1592,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wuwLSkZEUGPVLMsLRbPWABFtQym.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
