And in the late Dimebag Darrell, they certainly had the very finest rock guitarist since Ritchie Blackmore. This astonishing group rewrote the rules of heavy metal and their live performances had the power to change lives forever. This documentary film is a review of Pantera's career and music, and a tribute to the band and their sadly missed guitarist. Featuring rare archive footage of the group, filmed interviews with band members and their legendary producer Sterling Winfield, contributions from original vocalist Terry Glaze, opinion, review and enlightenment from experts such as Dimebag's biographer Zac Crain and Metal Hammer editor Alexander Milas, location shoots, film of the annual 'ride for dimebag 'event and a host of other features, all of which makes for the best documentary yet to emerge about Pantera.","popularity":0.121,"poster_path":"/sx9eUpbc1xBMCOL3LzyzNZkoajz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pantera: Screaming Black Messiahs - A Metal Tribute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Anselmo","original_name":"Phil Anselmo","popularity":0.1691,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b9e4fb3009aa00ffbf5f6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimebag Darrell","original_name":"Dimebag Darrell","popularity":0.4082,"profile_path":"/t494t0WINaShLg4Q7MSO1fAemuZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b9e50eefd3c200dfdf6dd6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinnie Paul","original_name":"Vinnie Paul","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b9e52d6aa8e000b0b0e5c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1100021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Brown","original_name":"Rex Brown","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/s5pD6OGp7d4IJtZjoqnaF6HEVcw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b9e53d27db6100c53c6931","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6498866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1322,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sx9eUpbc1xBMCOL3LzyzNZkoajz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":928}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
