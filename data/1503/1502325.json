They talk casually, not seeing anything special in it. No one, neither children nor adults, is surprised that two boys, abandoned by an alcoholic mother, live nearby. The children run the farm themselves, keep goats, and repair the roof. Another thing is strange to the villagers — the boys do not drink or smoke. This is really rare in the Russian countryside.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/kNtjCmfNx7VwfiINHaLYjS7nLdg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2002-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Boys Who Don't Drink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2318765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tofik Shakhverdiyev","original_name":"Тофик Шахвердиев","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/bFZca1QSupVbEohVQ3808DDoumM.jpg","credit_id":"68584ff6484b3a6c32d14ee0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2318765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tofik Shakhverdiyev","original_name":"Тофик Шахвердиев","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/bFZca1QSupVbEohVQ3808DDoumM.jpg","credit_id":"68585831aff53c9d294bd23f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2318765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tofik Shakhverdiyev","original_name":"Тофик Шахвердиев","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/bFZca1QSupVbEohVQ3808DDoumM.jpg","credit_id":"6858583b1bbdccb4d239900d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2318765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tofik Shakhverdiyev","original_name":"Тофик Шахвердиев","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/bFZca1QSupVbEohVQ3808DDoumM.jpg","credit_id":"68585845173adab2e2dedb83","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bw84Sdug9cCjdBLdwJI9RAqLiDv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sk2k7qJNw3N4udY8e8Dac4Fu3DC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kNtjCmfNx7VwfiINHaLYjS7nLdg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
