As the veteran walks, drives, pauses, and remembers, the city around him hums with a subtle contrast—alive, but indifferent. Parade banners hang limp. Memorial walls whisper names. The river keeps flowing.  Shot in long takes with natural sound and minimal score, After the Parade is less a traditional narrative than a cinematic poem about solitude, memory, and the spaces that hold our stories after we’re gone.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ntBInTYQSX78PxmqwrPyqAMdhKT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the crowds disappear, the silence tells the story.","title":"After the Parade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4555213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Felinton","original_name":"Samuel Felinton","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/uWlLMOJnXpx0nQLxIPx3GOhZ97J.jpg","credit_id":"68576b5e4272d1b7b04bce9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yKW01HYoSnOlDhBonREVN57pLtp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wUHpFyyMvkXxkcM6WanGG9S8NaS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/RhpBZDGHvA2PKVoiMnl3rqciZq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/szUN71tgPW7AWhnrVS0L6EBJ0G8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ntBInTYQSX78PxmqwrPyqAMdhKT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":340572,"name":"huntington, west virginia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
