It belongs to the genre of early “orientalist” acrobatic/horse spectacle films showcasing staged cavalry displays reminiscent of North African “fantasia” performances. The film is silent, roughly 2 minutes long (36 m of film at 16 fps), in black & white, and often hand-colored using Pathé’s pochoir or stencil process. The title refers to a traditional Maghreb equestrian ritual—teams of mounted riders synchronizing their gallop and firing volleys—popularized on stage and in photography in Europe at the time","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fantasia Arabe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
