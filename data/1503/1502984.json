It was inspired by the Stanley Kubrick horror film The Shining (1980) and named for the fictional Overlook Hotel where much of the film takes place. The collection focused on winter clothing in light and neutral colours, including chunky knitwear, fur and shearling coats, and parkas inspired by Inuit clothing. Showpiece items included a bustier made from rock crystal and a corset made from coils of aluminium, the latter provided by jeweller and frequent McQueen collaborator Shaun Leane.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/te47YHeDlJbZ6jI6cN6r2N1uyW2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Overlook A/W 1999","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429916,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Alexander McQueen","original_name":"Alexander McQueen","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/fa1b8qpGQuPDSzpbBFo7U3325gP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"6859edbc5aa019aa944f6a0f","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/te47YHeDlJbZ6jI6cN6r2N1uyW2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
