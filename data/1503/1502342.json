I've been sitting with this footage for years thinking it seemed random and dumb without context. but recently I decided screw it, we had fun shooting this and it would be a shame if it just sat in the deleted files archive forever.  so without any further waiting I present. one last summer.\r .","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We filmed a cult scene","title":"One last summer (deleted short film)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
