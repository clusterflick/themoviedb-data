Or at least we think he is, he gets easily distracted and we're not 100% sure the dog even exists. So maybe it's not a film about a lost dog, maybe it's a comedy about loneliness and the desperate need for meaningful human connection.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/eXzZCxF3SaBDDosHSxri8hTOI9K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266104,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Glass of Milk Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Lost Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Renton Skinner","original_name":"Dan Renton Skinner","popularity":0.4969,"profile_path":"/kWo8Y1VlH8gabKhsqbvAqIUoRWA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"685995365c7cbe1a3da5a320","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Edwards","original_name":"Justin Edwards","popularity":1.257,"profile_path":"/vhAAVpzdswyq95pmVyKv9PsQPyQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Terry","credit_id":"6859954053762b066da84a04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3804096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Steck","original_name":"Emily Steck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jogger","credit_id":"68599549361b1335b20ccc00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Armstrong","original_name":"Michael Armstrong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Park Warden","credit_id":"6859981cf359492810744dfd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2802158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Wade","original_name":"Simon Wade","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6859956c9b18f3f1720ccc07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2802157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wade","original_name":"Paul Wade","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6859957753762b066da84a08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2503280,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Donna Wade","original_name":"Donna Wade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685995815740026ec62381d2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2146239,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joanna Osborn","original_name":"Joanna Osborn","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6859958d53762b066da84a0b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717411,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elliott Barker","original_name":"Elliott Barker","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/eF9edQy7P9hGsIiEO8g6X1Wpx5R.jpg","credit_id":"6859959a8b3bcd4465a5a31e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2802158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Wade","original_name":"Simon Wade","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685997e2b2c999b4ff08d574","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33079452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1310,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eXzZCxF3SaBDDosHSxri8hTOI9K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":930}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6054,"name":"friendship"},{"id":14798,"name":"park"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":322268,"name":"comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lost Dog - Short Film Trailer","key":"986296882","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-07-18T08:19:17.000Z","id":"6859961d3fae63df73a5a315"}]}}}
