The film is inspired by the true story of Abdelaziz Ibrahim, an artist for the Palestinian Liberation Organization, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike. His family's attempts to repatriate his body to Syria were thwarted by the government, forcing a burial in Jordan, away from his loved ones. Denied the chance to visit his grave due to their refugee status, his grandmother began visiting unvisited graves on Eid, highlighting the profound struggles faced by Palestinians, who often remain without a homeland even in death.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rame Ibrahim","original_name":"Rame Ibrahim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6858641caa5c0602e8d0f929","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
