This experience strengthens her desire to establish a completely free all-girls' high school. With support and assistance from many parties, the Huaping High School for Girls is finally founded in 2008, specifically to offer free education to girls from impoverished families. Zhang Guimei makes a solemn pledge to get her students' academic results up to standard.  In the process of running the school, she faces immense difficulties with faculty, student recruitment, and funding. Relying on her firm ideals and beliefs, she leads the teaching staff in overcoming each obstacle one by one. She delivers a satisfactory result when all of her graduates achieve scores high enough for university admission on the college entrance exam, which in turn attracts more and more students to apply.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mDHYcygLlODV1yizCHgDNi4266O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":999,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Mountain Flowers Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mDHYcygLlODV1yizCHgDNi4266O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
