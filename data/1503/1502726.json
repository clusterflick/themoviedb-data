Escaping the grind at home, riding into the unknown, chasing inspiration and fresh perspectives.  This short dance film explores the parallel between being deep in a journey — overwhelmed by new impressions, unable to fully process or make sense of them — and the ability to express all of that through movement. The memories are stored not through thought, but through motion. It’s a tough ride that slowly reveals how much we take for granted, how dance speaks across all borders, and how the most instinctive, unplanned creations often become the most honest ones","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2025-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WEST","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joost Prinsen","original_name":"Joost Prinsen","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/kei7afrBZxfbzYHLMUkfvxm1Gs8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68596bc98b02671c2d996606","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904032,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rein Luuring","original_name":"Rein Luuring","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68596bd274286f5ffadede0b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522700,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erik Bos","original_name":"Erik Bos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68596bdd0c21cbd0b053d383","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simme Bruinsma","original_name":"Simme Bruinsma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68596be81c461d1d3639928d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Bos","original_name":"Thomas Bos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596b35cc93b8ec51deddae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Bos","original_name":"Thomas Bos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596b45a34b098b15b3401d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Bos","original_name":"Thomas Bos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596b559994bd130553d07a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522700,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erik Bos","original_name":"Erik Bos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596b686b3b3ac6a0b33fba","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951947,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milton Broen","original_name":"Milton Broen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596b93de9cada8294937cc","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522705,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vivianne Werkhoven","original_name":"Vivianne Werkhoven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596ba1631dd8846fd0fd35","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5522706,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vivianne Werkhoven","original_name":"Vivianne Werkhoven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596ba284bd0496df3992fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904032,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rein Luuring","original_name":"Rein Luuring","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68596badfbd15bc1133991c0","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hLSxZMEa5AhIi0rpKro4b9OdBHP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
