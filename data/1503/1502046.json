He takes a seat. Gradually, several hundred protagonists enter the square and approach the seated man in order to shake his hand. The simple and habitual gesture of the handshake is repeated so often that it transforms itself into a meaningful ritual. While the reason for the ceremonious meeting remains unknown, the encounter between the participants becomes charged with tension. A moment of connection occurs, not only between the persons, but also between the participants and the square, which is transformed into a stage.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/inefPfDfyd3sfBCa8Em9Ljxro5u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Encounter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1963185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Paci","original_name":"Adrian Paci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/m1r31Ecd7p1fbwGb6B0KzEfXxUf.jpg","credit_id":"68577ea6d064c6db1453cb55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sq","file_path":"/inefPfDfyd3sfBCa8Em9Ljxro5u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
