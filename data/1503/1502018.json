He renamed the film to Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl!, cut it down to 64 minutes, dubbed it over with English voices, and added a melodramatic score by Les Baxter. One scene can be found that was censored from the original cut of Bergman's film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/71Ug4xYJdvpHCPvcORCrout55yJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Davis-Hakim Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":6435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hallmark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1955-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everybody's Talking About Monika!","title":"Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harriet Andersson","original_name":"Harriet Andersson","popularity":0.8234,"profile_path":"/6uUPqEM4vs9mOylNZ9j5ewpi7kt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monika","credit_id":"68575d51b822f196f403688f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Ekborg","original_name":"Lars Ekborg","popularity":0.2578,"profile_path":"/t6VQyuw0kUdnMQ319yW8Civpajx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"68575d5b03e381eb03fc76cf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingmar Bergman","original_name":"Ingmar Bergman","popularity":1.8506,"profile_path":"/nkmOaXNRoioViN9OQf2n9Iu6akA.jpg","credit_id":"68575de72ba3d7258dcb4b68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6652,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gunnar Fischer","original_name":"Gunnar Fischer","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":"/hQReSi6DaGxuKbi1ZTrFcil9M24.jpg","credit_id":"68575e05fc4c969f9da463a9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kroger Babb","original_name":"Kroger Babb","popularity":0.0452,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68575e1874286f5ffaded739","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5519881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Lewellen","original_name":"Richard Lewellen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68575ebdc955e444c0a4635e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5519882,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"WM.
