Once known as the world’s cheap labor factory, China has now become a factory for billionaires—producing almost one a day. No other country without a democracy creates wealth at such speed.  But that rise may soon come to a halt: China’s top entrepreneurs find themselves caught in a cold war with a suspicious United States—and President Xi is cracking down hard. Tycoons are being silenced and re-educated to align with the superpower’s new strategic goals.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9CaabE0lDYsn4lsLrZIZy2Lfwmw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158863,"logo_path":"/jesjyrCXGl2f7mHWM9ROiQuepA7.png","name":"ZDFinfo","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Xi und die Geld-Elite: Harte Zeiten für Chinas Superreiche?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2342141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xi Jinping","original_name":"习近平","popularity":0.6796,"profile_path":"/kw0UwTQtDBdKKGUoHvRaWEvmX8T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6857fe131c461d1d36398e42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefanie Mau","original_name":"Stefanie Mau","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Sprecherin","credit_id":"6857fecadc3503522953cbe9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Lancaster","original_name":"Helen Lancaster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe3b9038e6df7bcb4d33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Lancaster","original_name":"Helen Lancaster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe439e13b90d10cb4dce","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5520584,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vince Beeton","original_name":"Vince Beeton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe559038e6df7bcb4d3e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1799545,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary Clarke","original_name":"Gary Clarke","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe61a945afdad4036a5f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056991,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wes Dorman","original_name":"Wes Dorman","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe69631dd8846fd0f804","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Hammond","original_name":"Mark Hammond","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe734ed15626a2cb4d65","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2896690,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dan Schwalm","original_name":"Dan Schwalm","popularity":0.2064,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe7c287d00b891a79625","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5520585,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Sweet","original_name":"James Sweet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe89ab44a7009a53cc38","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4624141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Thorne","original_name":"James Thorne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fe93dc97887d6ed0f830","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5520586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chas Francis","original_name":"Chas Francis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fea2125d252bb8cb4e60","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4674385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Jones","original_name":"Ben Jones","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857feb1695ab1e3444bd0ca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4159939,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amy Freeman","original_name":"Amy Freeman","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6857fedfb3222f4dc0a794e0","department":"Production","job":"Head of Production"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9CaabE0lDYsn4lsLrZIZy2Lfwmw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
