But China has not only caught up in many areas—it has overtaken. What was once a partnership has become a dependency.  And that dependency is becoming harder to ignore. China is no longer just an economic powerhouse—it’s asserting itself politically, too. Whether in the Ukraine war, its ties to Russia, or ongoing threats toward Taiwan, China has shifted from a quiet partner in globalization to a self-confident global power. In Berlin, politicians are waking up to a new reality: what used to be a relationship has turned into reliance—and cutting ties isn’t that simple.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lQtBHCM4h0Xt4zzInVo680Srlds.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abhängig von China: Warum wir nicht einfach \"Schluss machen\" können","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2342141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xi Jinping","original_name":"习近平","popularity":0.6796,"profile_path":"/kw0UwTQtDBdKKGUoHvRaWEvmX8T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68580e4a247daa3c33c7b009","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisabeth Schmidt","original_name":"Elisabeth Schmidt","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580e883e8088a976036b48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5520741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Reichart","original_name":"Thomas Reichart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580ec033e661d9dfd0f7fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3395957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Zimmermann","original_name":"Diana Zimmermann","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580ed4bbd92aa58aa7a5e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisabeth Schmidt","original_name":"Elisabeth Schmidt","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580ee5d90936e847deda5c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375825,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Felix Korfmann","original_name":"Felix Korfmann","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580ef61f8894481b493226","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5520743,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Leif stange","original_name":"Leif stange","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580f0b9e13b90d10cb4e21","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917101,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mehmet Ulutas","original_name":"Mehmet Ulutas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580f269e13b90d10cb4e24","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516556,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jannis Vieting","original_name":"Jannis Vieting","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580f39125d252bb8cb4ec6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990439,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Dottschadis","original_name":"Jan Dottschadis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580f47db46044f27ded9ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917103,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andre Störiko","original_name":"Andre Störiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68580f53df13f0fb61a465f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lQtBHCM4h0Xt4zzInVo680Srlds.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
