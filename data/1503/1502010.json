I was the only filmmaker to respond favorably to this request, and I created a tribute to 1965 by \"compressing\" a cult film from that year: Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville .  Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville Compression is a 25-fold reduction of Alphaville , the 1965 masterpiece Jean-Luc Godard directed, starring Anna Karina, Eddie Constantine, Howard Vernon, and Akim Tamiroff, from a runtime of 1 hour 30 minutes into a 4-minute film. The film is \"compressed\" in the manner of a work by César. But unlike the work of this artist, who compressed everyday objects, Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville Compression compresses an artistic object!  The feat and challenge of Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville Compression was to create a total compression: in this film, not a single shot from the original film is missing!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gOPSVNiB6UGdkLDA2IVBqSzxBxR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Amis de Cinématon","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":100597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Archives de l’Art Cinématonique","origin_country":""},{"id":98738,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Fondation Gérard Courant","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Compression Alphaville de Jean-Luc Godard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2948,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"68575121881c3fc6024bcedc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2948,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"6857512bf65e9014db036818","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2948,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"6857513c5b73f366fb036835","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2948,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"68575149307fe532a84bcf05","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2948,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"68575156b383d0ec3c398c02","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gOPSVNiB6UGdkLDA2IVBqSzxBxR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Rencontres du 8e type, Tours","release_date":"1995-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
