Mozambique used cinema newsreels as a crucial propaganda tool after the Portugese colonisers left. Madagascar boycotted US movies, so its screens were dominated by French, Indian and Hong Kong films instead. But a few films managed to get made. The situation in Zimbabwe was the worst, except that alone of the three countries it possessed an efficient film laboratory.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/s6cW1B6xkqRKlL5jtExjFFTt4Zk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visions Cinema: Cinema as Foreign Exchange","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Visions Cinema: Cinema as Foreign Exchange","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Archer","original_name":"Karen Archer","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"685857e02711c4eb36d14f05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Chigorimbo","original_name":"Stephen Chigorimbo","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6858581bc54ba576704934aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5521187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Katiyo","original_name":"Wilson Katiyo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6858583b5247ca6cb04bd0e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5521189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Marezda","original_name":"Claude Marezda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68585866592c9f761cdedc91","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1720097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Claude Rahaga","original_name":"Jean-Claude Rahaga","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6858589b8b1135b67a493306","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5521190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannot Rarojo","original_name":"Jeannot Rarojo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"685858ccd4bce1e4b8d14f07","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736044,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ignace Solo Randrasana","original_name":"Ignace Solo Randrasana","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"685858f3118febeb50d0f93c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4463565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benoît Ramampy","original_name":"Benoît Ramampy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"685859094ae95e2757036bbe","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5521191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Matola","original_name":"Samuel Matola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6858592cc193c8f1c1a79736","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2875584,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pedro Pimenta","original_name":"Pedro Pimenta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"68585a1774286f5ffadedabb","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Hartog","original_name":"Simon Hartog","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685857adaa7a0219ad398f2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Hartog","original_name":"Simon Hartog","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685857b633e661d9dfd0f952","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20412304","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s6cW1B6xkqRKlL5jtExjFFTt4Zk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cinema as Foreign Exchange","key":"d7dkZVM5jMk","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-09T14:14:27.000Z","id":"68585a93f65e9014db036b84"}]}}}
