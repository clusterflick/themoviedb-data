Yiorgos Kolozis went to Donoussa for the first time in 1972 – back then, there was no electricity nor tourists. Staying at Kedros beach all by himself, he acquired the name Yiorgos of Kedros. Yiorgos’s death in 2009 led Yiannis, his son, to continue his work, creating a story in which time is treated as a reconsideration of the present moment.","popularity":0.0452,"poster_path":"/AodGHdqPAjFH4tjQDCEOVcokKDI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yiorgos of Kedros","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Kolozis","original_name":"Yiannis Kolozis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec92ecfd2147c0021b7d348","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiorgos Kolozis","original_name":"Γιώργος Κολόζης","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec92f000fb17f001b7d1af9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Kolozis","original_name":"Yiannis Kolozis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92e9ee635710022d1ec16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Kolozis","original_name":"Yiannis Kolozis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92eb07f1d83001fdcf33e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Kolozis","original_name":"Yiannis Kolozis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92eb5d2147c0023c1d886","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Kolozis","original_name":"Yiannis Kolozis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92eba6c849200202fe0e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Kolozis","original_name":"Yiannis Kolozis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92ec1eb79c2001ea2407c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Kolozis","original_name":"Yiannis Kolozis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92ec76c849200212d3c27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiorgos Kolozis","original_name":"Γιώργος Κολόζης","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92f10eb79c2001fa1df8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1906,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AodGHdqPAjFH4tjQDCEOVcokKDI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1278}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
