The relationship between these two men goes back to the time when Shaq was 13 and living on an army base in Germany when he asked the coach for some exercise tips. Since that day, O’Neal has received at least one letter or email from Brown every week—and a lot more of them during their three years together in Baton Rouge. Back then, they might have seemed very different, but they forged a deep friendship that they cherish to this day.","popularity":0.77,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaq & Dale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim McGraw","original_name":"Tim McGraw","popularity":0.9534,"profile_path":"/gJdDFQHnsptnjI1bepJ2nxzBPkv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"619d909bf90b190042850c8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaquille O'Neal","original_name":"Shaquille O'Neal","popularity":1.0823,"profile_path":"/dPpPU1y7JEOQHVGv6vNLcCDJhLP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"619d90a05e12000043da4487","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Brown","original_name":"Dale Brown","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"619d90a6663627006279afaa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034025,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dom Savio","original_name":"Dom Savio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e391b5e1200008df4fed7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904555,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Cohen","original_name":"Aaron Cohen","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e38ff8de0ae0063317eb2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031248,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Carruthers","original_name":"Paul Carruthers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e390e8de0ae008d9fbfcd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Storm","original_name":"Hannah Storm","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648f67102f8d09013afa9507","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nP5AL7KphhByxjCPg0tfbKRno5c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
