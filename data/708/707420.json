Gwyn offers the brooch to the wind and receives back a tiny silvery spider - Arianwen, the snow spider - confirming that, as his grandmother had already guessed, he has inherited magical powers from his Celtic ancestor Gwydyon, a powerful magician whose exploits are described in the fourth book (\"Math Son of Mathonwy\") of the Mabinogion. With the help of the snow spider, Gwyn embarks on adventures involving other worlds of snow and silver, as he attempts to solve the five-year-old mystery of his sister Beth's disappearance in a snow storm.","popularity":0.863,"poster_path":"/1rvK1zodcSymV5FsDG61g02mRQM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Snow Spider","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siân Phillips","original_name":"Siân Phillips","popularity":0.4169,"profile_path":"/k2OIQZUWLTlZYfHjpS5X8csYbSY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nain Griffiths","credit_id":"6178df66e323f3002593f111","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":185825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Morgan","original_name":"Sharon Morgan","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/7fwreHAcz74r3urkfJl0m8Sh5Qw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gynis Griffiths","credit_id":"6178df8771f0950042d67d2a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Blythe","original_name":"Robert Blythe","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/7Mhfa9lauoGkBB1t4jTYIEUuyfJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ivor Griffiths","credit_id":"6178df95894ed6006478d000","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2595392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osian Roberts","original_name":"Osian Roberts","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gwyn Griffiths","credit_id":"6178dfa9e323f3002593f184","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gareth Pritchard","original_name":"Gareth Pritchard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alun Lloyd","credit_id":"6178dfeac14fee008cc1c693","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rossilyn Killick","original_name":"Rossilyn Killick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Eirlys","credit_id":"6178dffaf859580064366313","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":208155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Elisa","original_name":"Gillian Elisa","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/iddLFDbtSUwo4jRV5HRLxW2RBSf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Davies","credit_id":"6178e021c2b9df008bde3a73","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ifan Huw Dafydd","original_name":"Ifan Huw Dafydd","popularity":0.2514,"profile_path":"/4EZiobWxlHiJ4cH6MO8o178L2tT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Davies","credit_id":"6178e037924ce6002741a069","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jill Richards","original_name":"Jill Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Lloyd","credit_id":"6178e062d6dbba0091e7e508","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2128610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glan Davies","original_name":"Glan Davies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mr. Lloyd","credit_id":"6178e07ccf4b8b0042950316","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Williams","original_name":"Noel Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"6178e0be0d5d85009168a6e1","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McAvoy","original_name":"John McAvoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"PC Price","credit_id":"6178e0dda097dc00427a0590","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
