Often accused of being static and conservative, in truth Heavy Metal is a radical form of music that regularly re-invents itself, and one which attracts generation after generation of musicians willing to learn from the past, but hungry to evolve the future. And so it was that, in the early 1980s, a young man called Lars Ulrich was so taken by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal creating music paper headlines, that he came to England to track down obscure records, take them home to LA and, with his buddies, listen to them - until they came up with a genre of their own, soon be termed Thrash. This film is a study of this new dawn in rock music, and with the aid of those who were there at the time, presents both the story of this fascinating musical journey and reassess the sounds, the bands, the impact and the legacy of Thrash.","popularity":0.5071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prism Films","origin_country":""},{"id":6614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chrome Dreams Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metallica: from the off","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hetfield","original_name":"James Hetfield","popularity":0.4702,"profile_path":"/1DBDpjWorXCwvMQLZeDIGfDQ5sJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6665eba5f37d0694b2e9b50c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Ulrich","original_name":"Lars Ulrich","popularity":0.1559,"profile_path":"/uMcUqvbViiHftEpz0u4AxAnCgF3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6665ebb6cfd36b632b53210a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirk Hammett","original_name":"Kirk Hammett","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/wMsYlpaoALVgtOColQ9Fl68mx0u.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6665ebea661de91de4be5b4a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Trujillo","original_name":"Robert Trujillo","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/aDy6CSER3EcKrP2YPijW7Z9kJ8H.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6665ebff422c8d07f0a67bd9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Pomfret","original_name":"Tony Pomfret","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Voiceover","credit_id":"6665ecadf95cd4ae39138639","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1840244,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Lowden","original_name":"Peter Lowden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6665ec99f5090bed09a146ef","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4765431,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Angela Turner","original_name":"Angela Turner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6665ec61a004e0cde3a67b04","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137545,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Johnstone","original_name":"Rob Johnstone","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6665ec42e71034010fbe5cb9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
