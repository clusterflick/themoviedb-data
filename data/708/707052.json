Tupac is saved by hiding under the bed, he was 5 years old at that time. Tupac always believed that the El Familiar (a legendary demon dog that devours people) was responsible for the tragedy, but, over the years, he discovers, with the help of his friend Nusta that it was not a fantastic beast who took his family, but four men who continue to kill and kidnap other people. Thus, Tupac decides to go after them using traditional weapons and martial arts -which he inherited from his father- to become DOGMAN and get revenge. * The Colla are an indigenous people from South American countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru.","popularity":0.0921,"poster_path":"/jYeBJhNsKLy9h6XdQf3Xq4TEgtw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121844,"logo_path":null,"name":"Te Digo Que Producciones","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":134272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lun치tica Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2021-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hombre perro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3030766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Kim Fukaura","original_name":"Roberto Kim Fukaura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"606316861f98d10028c8795b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magaly Solier","original_name":"Magaly Solier","popularity":0.3745,"profile_path":"/twX0in8k7Wyg8XpCXy75SsuX3sa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6063168f1130bd00556073e9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2713502,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sami Buccella","original_name":"Sami Buccella","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/vvcHHwiEMDjY4smlDTt0My1YNbw.jpg","credit_id":"65a5c70303f0b600c6d5b98d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicol치s Britos","original_name":"Nicol치s Britos","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec73d429979d20021392f8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamae Garateguy","original_name":"Tamae Garateguy","popularity":0.0808,"profile_path":"/ilWK781F6EOVMpvciGbI7R8EJgX.jpg","credit_id":"5ec73d34ae2811001f3c9b2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7RYODW9DqwVfqIW28h8eN5c2Xei.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/jYeBJhNsKLy9h6XdQf3Xq4TEgtw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
