Saw it recently ... and was very impressed and interested - made me want to see it a few more times. ... But your film, even though I see it operating through composition (pictorial plus time-based) did get me on the edge of my seat - the image quality throughout was really rather extraordinary. In addition, the film just seemed somehow more serious, which is I guess a matter of a kind of depth and subtlety. So anyhow, you kind of won me over to where my prejudices just melted away.\" - Fred Worden","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fur of this Animal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Doberman","original_name":"Gary Doberman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec873298e2e00002020b827","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
