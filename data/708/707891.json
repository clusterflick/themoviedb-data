Nassia recalls and reminisces how she left her husband in Moldavia, a man who used to drink and hit her and then ask her “why are you trembling? I haven’t begun hitting you yet.” Nassia leaves Moldavia to save herself. When it doesn’t drive you wild, poverty and violence can transform you into an angel. A life’s worth nothing; and nothing’s worth as much as a single life.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/exfX0b1QDU7qlNZL6WGFJHZq2K4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic in People: Broken Greek","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651196,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aggelos Aggelopoulos","original_name":"Aggelos Aggelopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9cd806c849200212dd37c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1088940,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Penny Panayotopoulou","original_name":"Πέννυ Παναγιωτοπούλου","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9cd5b8e2e00002022c1d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290199,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dimitris Katsaitis","original_name":"Δημήτρης Κατσαίτης","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9cd78e635710022d2dfd4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kallia Papadaki","original_name":"Κάλλια Παπαδάκη","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9cd6ee635710020d02f31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1088940,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Penny Panayotopoulou","original_name":"Πέννυ Παναγιωτοπούλου","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9cd446c8492001f2b8fc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1088940,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Penny Panayotopoulou","original_name":"Πέννυ Παναγιωτοπούλου","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9cd4ed2147c0021b83a58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651197,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pavlos Kosmidis","original_name":"Pavlos Kosmidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9cd89e635710021ce378a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8761892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/exfX0b1QDU7qlNZL6WGFJHZq2K4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
