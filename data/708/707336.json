De Seta always turns his eye to realities already then threatened by \"development without progress\", giving a precious testimony of rituals, customs and knowledge that have now disappeared. Thanks to the contribution of the Cineteca di Bologna and Martin Scorsese, who called De Seta \"an anthropologist who expresses himself with the voice of a poet\", all these works have been digitized.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/fhold3Ks2SNU4v4evIpK2maYRag.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2009-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittorio De Seta","original_name":"Vittorio De Seta","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/l8FiVqWTETPBv9pesnyNa3PB9wD.jpg","credit_id":"5ec8088b140bad001d1b6a6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittorio De Seta","original_name":"Vittorio De Seta","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/l8FiVqWTETPBv9pesnyNa3PB9wD.jpg","credit_id":"5ec80942140bad001c180c21","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1982718","wikidata_id":"Q3794871","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3oDt7eWQIel91KUci9cnu34IB0P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fhold3Ks2SNU4v4evIpK2maYRag.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":558},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":832,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lczvqwwCEs8UV5OQmsnuOwkea2K.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":555},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2049,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gASDs6lXHsQpOXQn3Hfbhupw8Le.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1366},{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rqQXDrzUljexYMIsAyXv81YIqPY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":514},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":888,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vkR90WB7oJbvJy429MtuTkLwYlj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":3,"width":592},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":830,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tIMCdgnW0DKN8LBTQSYDJCuRIG5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":3,"width":554},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":867,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ytVTVwdGISBVl3hdUP6WruWgd9Q.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
