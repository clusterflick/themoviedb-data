The Romaniotes became an integral part of the cultural mosaic of the city of Ioannina since the Byzantine era, but faced the danger of extinction during the harsh period of the Second World War. Narrating their history through time unfolds not only the story of the city, but of the whole country by and large.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/2tv1qpC5lv8mWLVww3kDzvMUDh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115308,"logo_path":"/iC7hASZCmzAalV9ryDjzJLl5Vu6.png","name":"Cosmote TV","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2019-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romaniotes, the Greek Jews of Ioannina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stelios Tatakis","original_name":"Στέλιος Τατάκης","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c4f7f1d83001fdd7a12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stelios Tatakis","original_name":"Στέλιος Τατάκης","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c30d2147c0021b80b92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650932,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stathis Galazoulas","original_name":"Στάθης Γαλαζούλας","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c41a35c8e0021e2fd79","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stelios Tatakis","original_name":"Στέλιος Τατάκης","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c55d2147c0021b80ba0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnes Sklavou","original_name":"Agnes Sklavou","popularity":0.1736,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c1beb79c2001ea2bb90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnes Sklavou","original_name":"Agnes Sklavou","popularity":0.1736,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c378e2e000021290f38","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexis Gkikas","original_name":"Alexis Gkikas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c618e2e000021290f54","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650935,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marios Gligoris","original_name":"Marios Gligoris","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c6ae635710020cff0ce","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72522,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Artemis Skouloudi","original_name":"Artemis Skouloudi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec98c776c849200203058fb","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11732516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2tv1qpC5lv8mWLVww3kDzvMUDh0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
