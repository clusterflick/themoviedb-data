She and her musician partner Nóra decide to adopt a child and focus on building a family together. With a sensitive lens and close access, directors Asia Dér and Sári Haragonics follow the two women through their long and ultimately successful adoption process to bring home their young daughter of Roma origins. But tensions begin to rise between the two as Virág thrives in her role as mother and Nóra struggles to find her place within the family. As the rising tides of hate and homophobia in Hungary begin to overflow into their family, their lives hit a boiling point and they must face the difficult decision of whether to leave their country behind.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":"/4SFQlsm4GDCG1DOqgKVcL5nNwA6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Campfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":48582,"logo_path":"/tyoN6zoxMJ71GBddxVkk4dpaeze.png","name":"HBO
