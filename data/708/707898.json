Several ships, avoiding the dangerous travel around the whole of Peloponnese, were transferred from the Corinth Golf to the Golf of Saronikos, on top of an eight-wheel vehicle dragged along a stone-paved road (the “Diolkos”), almost parallel to the actual Corinth-Canal. The film describes several technical details of the whole operation, as well as various events such as the visits of the sailors to an ancient Greek Temple and to a tavern, where a hypothetically available Hydraulis (water organ) was played, or to a public fountain encountered along the Diolkos.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/xjr74DpEV3i8u6nAJMLJCJwUw3y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Technical Chamber of Greece","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2009-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diolkos for 1,500 years","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodosis Tasios","original_name":"Theodosis Tasios","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec9d2958e2e003dd61347ae","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodosis Tasios","original_name":"Theodosis Tasios","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d2a5eb79c20020a2b562","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651230,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nikitas Mekas","original_name":"Nikitas Mekas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d2b90fb17f001c7c576a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodosis Tasios","original_name":"Theodosis Tasios","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d29f6c849200212ddc56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651230,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nikitas Mekas","original_name":"Nikitas Mekas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d2b2140bad001b1b8ce3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laertis Malkotsis","original_name":"Λαέρτης Μαλκότσης","popularity":0.8082,"profile_path":"/u4jFSLEcZe8jWrEqWKNsc8EF7gz.jpg","credit_id":"5ec9d2c2d2147c0022bc982d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xjr74DpEV3i8u6nAJMLJCJwUw3y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
