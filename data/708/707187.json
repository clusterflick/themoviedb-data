On the southeastern coast of Spain, a 45-year-old British woman, aided by her volunteer helpers, has set up a rescue farm; a modern-day Noah’s Arc that offers refuge and healing to undernourished and tortured horses (and other animals). A humble yet noble tale of perseverance and endurance and a parable for our times, which applies to people as well: once our shine comes off, society deems us redundant.","popularity":0.0691,"poster_path":"/aOneAfKUIXEpY1Dtenr2EYrGll0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evolution
