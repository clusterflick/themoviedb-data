A film about the beauty of archeology and excavation, conveyed through the post-mortem portrait of archeologist Yannis Sakellarakis. A journey in search of a man who is no longer present, through the traces he left in the places he visited and the people he met. A cinematic excavation that brings to light an image through fragments and traces, just like archeology does.","popularity":0.0715,"poster_path":"/p0cV7t7MMChqn4PdfuQgCOs4zpK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portolanos Films","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/hDJO96mUfqtB9ia7ef7mEvguPxl.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trace of Time","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620617,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Gentekou","original_name":"Μαρία Γεντέκου","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d09a9979d200213a1487","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yagos Heretis","original_name":"Yagos Heretis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d08be635710022cf9982","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2649072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dionysia Kopana","original_name":"Dionysia Kopana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d062ae2811001e3c62a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649077,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elias Koulamas","original_name":"Elias Koulamas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d082140bad001b1923f3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2649072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dionysia Kopana","original_name":"Dionysia Kopana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d05cd2147c0022ba511a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2649072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dionysia Kopana","original_name":"Dionysia Kopana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d0689979d2002031e3e8","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649074,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vangelis Koulinos","original_name":"Vangelis Koulinos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d0716c8492001f2a284b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649076,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Despina Charalampous","original_name":"Despina Charalampous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec7d07a140bad001b1923e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15070742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xc7aYxpC2crElxyLfryAK4wphrJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":926,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p0cV7t7MMChqn4PdfuQgCOs4zpK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":617},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1650,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/paVlbO7yq7ZFNH2c6DZI62gA1up.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"K","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
