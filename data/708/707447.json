The events are unfolded through the written testimonials of a Venetian officer, an Ottoman traveler, a citizen of Candia and the poet of the Cretan Renaissance, M.T. Buniales. The documentary portrays modern-day Heraclion, avoiding to reconstruct the historical period of the siege through the use of costumes and mise-en-scène.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/z02O8o2ESclUJ90kKP8NBIDZcWb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gate of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yannis Gigourtzis","original_name":"Yannis Gigourtzis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec848f60fb17f001b7bf95d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tasoula Markomichelaki","original_name":"Tasoula Markomichelaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec848fee24b930021d566f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonis Perantonakis","original_name":"Antonis Perantonakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec84908ae281100203bd40d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","original_name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec849136c849200202e30cd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649690,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonidas Chartofilakas","original_name":"Leonidas Chartofilakas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848d86c8492001f2a7040","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649690,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonidas Chartofilakas","original_name":"Leonidas Chartofilakas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848df595a56001cb96293","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","original_name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848bee635710020ce8312","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","original_name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848b4d2147c0022bad177","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Panos Kerasiotis","original_name":"Panos Kerasiotis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848e7ae2811001f3e40df","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","original_name":"Manolis Sfakianakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848af8e2e00002126c338","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649688,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexandros Chatzipanagiotis","original_name":"Alexandros Chatzipanagiotis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848c90fb17f001c7b276e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649688,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexandros Chatzipanagiotis","original_name":"Alexandros Chatzipanagiotis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec848ce9979d200203230b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z02O8o2ESclUJ90kKP8NBIDZcWb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
