This will be the start of a young man's journey on a road that led to the construction of a factory and a society, which is largely unique in our country's history. Jonsered's factories, which came to own a whole community and took care of everyone, from the cradle to the grave. The factory owned a nursing home with a maternity ward, a nursery for the youngest, a school that fostered the prospective workers, a girls' home for young workers, housing, a trade booth, a church with a factory-employed priest and, finally, an old age home for those who rested after a long working life.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/8W6qiMW6xe3rOe6Dw3pvnpFsGZR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmateljén","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"About
