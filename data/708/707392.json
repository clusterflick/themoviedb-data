The premeditated assault left seventeen Mormon men and boys dead and more than a dozen others wounded. But those who remained had little time to mourn their loss. Afraid of another attack, short of help, and facing unseasonably cold temperatures, the shocked survivors quickly buried fourteen of their dead in an unfinished dry well. During the weeks and months that followed, life at Hawn’s Mill was bleak, especially for the women and children whose husbands and fathers had been killed or wounded. Those left behind struggled to provide for their families. Yet the experiences of the Latter-day Saints at Hawn’s Mill exemplify incredible faith, courage, and commitment in the midst of terrible tragedy. Their stories touch the deepest of sympathies, inspire faith, and strengthen testimony.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yDIJSJMZ2Kukcrh7i7RRT1rdhT1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tragedy and Truth: What Happened at Hawn's Mill","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982652,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dennis Lyman","original_name":"Dennis Lyman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642239508d22fc00a9deb87c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Rawson","original_name":"Glenn Rawson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642239672dc9dc00fd1c3215","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982658,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Davis","original_name":"Matt Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64223a4823be4600febebfc5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Lyman","original_name":"Adam Lyman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642239ea2dc9dc00fd1c32a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryant Bush","original_name":"Bryant Bush","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642239cb08cf87007f391d3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Rawson","original_name":"Glenn Rawson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6422398d8d22fc01128b161b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yDIJSJMZ2Kukcrh7i7RRT1rdhT1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Haun's Mill Massacre Site","key":"_iSlzuy3wwA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-06-03T16:07:18.000Z","id":"5ec82105e24b93001fd4ca8e"}]}}}
