Untouched by the passage of time, it’s being preserved by the myths that comprise the village’s oral tradition, which in turn passes on from generation to generation and building up the forest’s legend. People say that if the forest is “disturbed” in any way, the consequences will be devastating. As a result, the forest survives without any human intervention – something rare in our modern times.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/4XoC0ovSZHYmyChJWfZsRXpRq0y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"St. Viniri – The Sacred Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650476,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iakovos Dislis","original_name":"Iakovos Dislis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92512d2147c0021b7cc3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantina Messini","original_name":"Konstantina Messini","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec924f4a35c8e0021e27b11","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantina Messini","original_name":"Konstantina Messini","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec924e86c849200212d3261","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650472,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yannis Tomtsis","original_name":"Yannis Tomtsis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec924fdeb79c2001ea22e83","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantina Messini","original_name":"Konstantina Messini","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec924eea35c8e0021e27b0c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650474,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joanna Kordel","original_name":"Joanna Kordel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec92505a35c8e001fe247e7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XoC0ovSZHYmyChJWfZsRXpRq0y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
