Rome is afraid of the Tyrant and of its own power. And all these fears seem to crystallize in that of fire, more than anything else feared in this megalopolis that so often catches fire. In 64 A.D. the most terrible fire that the city has ever known broke out. It is said that it was set on the orders of Nero, in order to overwhelm the Christians who were accused of it. The watchmen, Celer and Theseus, intervene at the risk of their lives. This fictional documentary tells the story of the adventures of these two \"firemen\" in Rome during the Empire. An astonishing journey through time, the story of the life of men: customs, family, lifestyle, politics, education, leisure.","popularity":0.4213,"poster_path":"/r3fg9e6azUIXRU9dGiRYlAXopP4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1042,"logo_path":"/cv8uj3G9fhe7vifZB6yjTzqI45V.png","name":"Cinecittà
