This film tells the story of this return centred on the desire to get closer to the mystery of the life and work of an enlightened man. It is the time for a memory, not an expeditious biography. Fernando recounts excerpts from his life, his work as an architect, university rector and mayor of La Reina. From the \"Fifth\", the place of childhood, he remembers with sincerity and simplicity. Like a watchman, like a lighthouse, he illuminates our present, like a compass shows us the way to build a world where affection and social justice prevail.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":129436,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV 10 Angeres","origin_country":""},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El País de mi padre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Pays de mon père","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastián Moreno","original_name":"Sebastián Moreno","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9f32fd2147c0021b85bd3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651396,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eva Freigeles-Aimé","original_name":"Eva Freigeles-Aimé","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9f35cd2147c0021b85bfd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651397,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mariano Montalvo","original_name":"Mariano Montalvo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9f36c140bad001c19bcbd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Castillo","original_name":"Carmen Castillo","popularity":0.0734,"profile_path":"/1KHrDPnJJ3VDwT6HJt1vazyWD0J.jpg","credit_id":"5ec9f31d8e2e000020233dfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
