(...) It seeks to function like a microcosm of contemporary Malay society. There's envy and backbiting, but also love and understanding. People are conscious of status. The old are quick to judge the young. Men are socially privileged, but women sometimes make their own worst enemies.\" (Amir Muhammad, '120 Malay Movies', 2010)","popularity":0.1182,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Village Neighbours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Yatimah","original_name":"Rose Yatimah","popularity":0.0615,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec7ae95ae2811001f3d5ab2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siput Sarawak","original_name":"Siput Sarawak","popularity":0.6384,"profile_path":"/fJbxWVjCXcPpvLv5fiom7ZiGRTr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec7aea0d2147c0023bf45b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1048358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yusof Latiff","original_name":"Yusof Latiff","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec7aeac9979d2001f356081","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Osman","original_name":"Ahmad Osman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec7aebfae281100203b6714","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salleh Melan","original_name":"Salleh Melan","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec7aecdae2811001e3c42b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neng Yatimah","original_name":"Neng Yatimah","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec7aed29979d2002139e63d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2648869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariam Rahim","original_name":"Mariam Rahim","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec7aee8d2147c0022ba2f7d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hussein Haniff","original_name":"Hussein Haniff","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/hJRIuhJd6AEHl1XyLme9T6Ppi5d.jpg","credit_id":"5ec7aefa9979d2002031caef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hussein Haniff","original_name":"Hussein Haniff","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/hJRIuhJd6AEHl1XyLme9T6Ppi5d.jpg","credit_id":"5ec7af0d6c849200202d439a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6578472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Malay\", \"english_name\"=>\"Malay\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ms\", \"native_name\"=>\"Malay\"}","note":"","release_date":"1965-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
