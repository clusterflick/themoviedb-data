The film takes us through a critical year in the life of Georgia's young democracy- from the presidential election of January 2008 to the chaos of the war with Russia and the sobering aftermath - and raises questions about political responsibility and the morality of international affairs. The story is told through its main actors: the Georgian president, the Georgian government, the political opposition, foreign leaders, international delegations and organisations and the ordinary Georgian people.","popularity":0.0963,"poster_path":"/1f4b0J1blnHBpkJfsfJV9ZBcoC9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2009-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something About Georgia","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Saakashvili","original_name":"Mikhail Saakashvili","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ysTop2V3Aj6FVLvkbiaAAccuQCa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec95f788e2e000020220588","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Kirtadzé","original_name":"ნინო კირთაძე","popularity":0.2599,"profile_path":"/hh8M1iMxstDDUD2Jlsuv0Hp6E5v.jpg","credit_id":"5ec95f3ed2147c0023c21aca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Kirtadzé","original_name":"ნინო კირთაძე","popularity":0.2599,"profile_path":"/hh8M1iMxstDDUD2Jlsuv0Hp6E5v.jpg","credit_id":"5ec95f387f1d83001fdd3b42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1634131","wikidata_id":"Q52395078","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1455,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1f4b0J1blnHBpkJfsfJV9ZBcoC9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":970}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Something about Georgia by Nino Kirtadze","key":"28552811","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2011-09-03T18:43:29.000Z","id":"5ec9602bd2147c0022bc2831"}]}}}
