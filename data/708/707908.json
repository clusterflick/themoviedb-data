What do they see and what do they experience? The everyday “journeys” to school around the globe are fascinating and full of surprises. An international documentary series that follows children at the four corners of the planet on their way from home to school. Their personalities are as varied as the landscapes in which they live. These children guide us through the endless diversity of landscapes across various continents and share their dreams, as well as their fears – of child labor, war, and delinquency – while praising the beauty of nature and the importance of friendship. We see the world through their eyes.","popularity":0.1481,"poster_path":"/4c1jPmwBcNqSgHJJ3AqhOmXA5Fo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"199 Little Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1502499,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Thorsten Harms","original_name":"Thorsten Harms","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d8cde635710022d2fc24","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigrid Klausmann","original_name":"Sigrid Klausmann","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d8b60fb17f001d7fd4d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Sittler","original_name":"Walter Sittler","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/sZd9NVaTja1b5KhiMmFZRRgGcNp.jpg","credit_id":"5ec9d8f2eb79c2001ea3315a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2536272,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Henk Drees","original_name":"Henk Drees","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d8d50fb17f001d7fd4f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2651260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ameen Nayfeh","original_name":"Ameen Nayfeh","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d8de8e2e00002022e56a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335568,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Benstead","original_name":"Chris Benstead","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d8e66c8492001f2b9c58","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerhard Schmidt","original_name":"Gerhard Schmidt","popularity":0.1808,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9d8fceb79c20020a2bde6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4c1jPmwBcNqSgHJJ3AqhOmXA5Fo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
