Akampene was the final destination for girls who got pregnant, breaking the taboo of premarital sex. Their fathers abandoned them on her shores and the island witnessed their deaths; be it from starvation or from drowning.  Today locals recall the story just as if it was an ancient legend. Thatâ€™s what the island fears the most, not death, but humans forgetting about her existence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punishment Island","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
