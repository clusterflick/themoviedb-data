This biopic follows the middle and later years of the life of Qi Gong (1912-2005), China’s most prestigious calligrapher and ink painter, whose dedication to teaching his art influenced many generations of artists. A lifelong yet unconcerned victim of forgery (‘they do it better than me’), Qi Gong suffered for his calling, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. Yet throughout his life he showed a tolerance and generosity of spirit that made him a beloved teacher and an icon for traditional Chinese Culture.","popularity":0.2672,"poster_path":"/qjU3fqIshXa9VxBesggNxqGHbQc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Bodei Golden Film Media Co.
