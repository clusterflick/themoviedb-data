The protagonists were pink big-nosed creatures comically fashioned after horoscopes of the western zodiac and was set on a small star-shaped planet in the outer reaches of the universe. The antagonists were green blobbish creatures known appropriately as blobs governed by an even larger pink blob creature, Momo the Glutton. The cartoon's premise was somewhat similar to The Smurfs and The Care Bears.","popularity":1.0979,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Street: The Happy Birthday Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":214701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherry Lynn","original_name":"Sherry Lynn","popularity":0.284,"profile_path":"/cp7SYig9JVbBWgc2YD4wEUNQGzh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5aaf5a540e0a2665880205dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Ridgely","original_name":"Robert Ridgely","popularity":0.4782,"profile_path":"/9KXMqTrSeIxcW6hlCJZ6CTzNeMB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63bc0d3fae6f093c4e667686","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Adler","original_name":"Charlie Adler","popularity":0.5606,"profile_path":"/hVENHdlEqsX6vhBW4MTpfYEFFQ3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63bc0d43fa40460094a67943","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Berger","original_name":"Gregg Berger","popularity":0.4109,"profile_path":"/bMlJUmhblX50gQrnA8XWG7UuaLk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63bc0d4efa40460094a6794e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Pinney","original_name":"Patrick Pinney","popularity":0.4714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63bc0d53fa404600aefe2bd0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1358729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allison Argo","original_name":"Allison Argo","popularity":0.1621,"profile_path":"/d8k9OwBODF8MhSDfMYtsazpVzrD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63bc0d58a6e2d20083e1fb25","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bunker Jenkins","original_name":"Bunker Jenkins","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63bc0d64aede5900b103cc03","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127759,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Phil Mendez","original_name":"Phil Mendez","popularity":0.0924,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63bc0d70aede59009494ca46","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1100800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Svayko","original_name":"Mike Svayko","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bc0d0eaede5900da1f8902","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karen Mendez","original_name":"Karen Mendez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bc0da7fa40460087565fd1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David N.
