Elek had wanted to make this film in the early 1970s, but wasn’t allowed to. When she finally got the chance, the reactions were predictable, as the parallels with recent Hungarian history were simply too obvious for officialdom not to feel anxious. History may not repeat itself, but the variations look eerily similar.","popularity":0.1575,"poster_path":"/jIDA1ngddHQ7CGXcXdUN8Of1uU0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1980-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trial of Martinovics and the Hungarian Jacobins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Vizsgálat Martinovics Ignác szászvári apát és társainak ügyében","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Martinovics","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"János Ács","original_name":"János Ács","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6181562b075288002876a93b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamás Fodor","original_name":"Tamás Fodor","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/cOqINufStogR1eTsK6vaS1uyhcK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"618156673faba0008f5be3af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"György Petri","original_name":"György Petri","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61815671cb6db500622de356","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gábor Deme","original_name":"Gábor Deme","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"618156930752880063c36f66","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erzsébet Gaál","original_name":"Erzsébet Gaál","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6181569d3faba000421f1b07","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Székely B.
