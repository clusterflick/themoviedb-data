She follows the cycle of optimism, building and eventual decline, meeting people who 50 years on bear witness to the effects of housing on real families, striking a contemporary chord with the theme of immigration and gentrification affecting working class communities. The irresistible nostalgia of scenes from the 1950s, 60s and 70s is tempered by a realisation of the force of history at work.","popularity":0.2073,"poster_path":"/3RdT6Ad9Q8pF2Wn3Ozj5fMxR429.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Rubble","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Penny Woolcock","original_name":"Penny Woolcock","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":"/fphFdTp1D2J0uGnI3FronRaKyMV.jpg","credit_id":"56aa0cd6c3a36872e1005fa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3683801,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Fry","original_name":"Alex Fry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644aaff7e4886005242bd924","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3257665,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Scott Sandford","original_name":"Scott Sandford","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644aaffeb6abc404953a6c5e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5451360","wikidata_id":"Q26916280","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qt3uanx9lzKNm9G6EOnUSbQm9e7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3RdT6Ad9Q8pF2Wn3Ozj5fMxR429.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
