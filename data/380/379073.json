The accolades and sales successes achieved by State Of the Art Of Computer Animation prompted the 1990 release of The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey, a title that would become the first member of the successful The Mind's Eye series. The next decade (1990â€“2000) would be taken up almost entirely with the production of 19 feature-length 3-D computer animated package films for home release.","popularity":0.0899,"poster_path":"/fwLv4yathB8kYGlISaJXtCRmKOe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The award-winning release of the world's first home entertainment video of computer animation,","title":"State of the Art of Computer Animation","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1155,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fwLv4yathB8kYGlISaJXtCRmKOe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":770}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
