In it, the character of Rod Rooter (Michael W Schwartz) is reviewing Devo's music videos for Big Entertainment. Much to his chagrin, his daughter Donut Rooter (Laraine Newman) is a fan of the band. Donut discovers the videos after asking her father for money to get an abortion (though this is not explicitly stated). Two excerpts from the storyline were included in the \"Complete Truth About De-Evolution\" laserdisc and DVD (both out of sequence) but the rest is exclusive to this videocassette. \"Theme from Doctor Detroit\" was also not included, and is unique to this tape.
