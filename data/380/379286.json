A film without commentary in which multiple images, sometimes complementary, sometimes contrasting, draw the viewer through the different stages of a labyrinth. The tone of the film moves from great joy to wrenching sorrow; from stark simplicity to ceremonial pomp. It is life as it is lived by the people of the world, each one, as the film suggests, in a personal labyrinth. Re-released in 1979 as \"In the Labyrinth\" by the National Film Board of Canada in a 21-minute single projection format.","popularity":0.3492,"poster_path":"/9jBHEyo47XEQpEJA6of28gadt3e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1967-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Labyrinth","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Dans le labyrinthe","type":"French language title"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Labyrinth","type":"Original (Expo 67), multi-projection format title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":356422,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roman Kroitor","original_name":"Roman Kroitor","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/UXB1hDtpvCaGUrf1PJ01IfZ7N7.jpg","credit_id":"56a5860dc3a36838a3007f28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Low","original_name":"Colin Low","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":"/nLNsXY9AzmjEfSoDXniMgwVGflJ.jpg","credit_id":"56a58618925141551c003f2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":196830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugh O'Connor","original_name":"Hugh O'Connor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a58634c3a36838960089a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1623380,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gilles Blais","original_name":"Gilles Blais","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5778db08c3a36832b00020a3","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Douglas Bradley","original_name":"Douglas Bradley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5778dac8925141566f002075","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644644,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Devolpi","original_name":"David Devolpi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5778db18c3a3681059000a44","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644645,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ken Poste","original_name":"Ken Poste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5778db25c3a36832690021b2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644643,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Hartmann","original_name":"Peter Hartmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5778daef9251411cd40033ba","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1644641,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alex O.
