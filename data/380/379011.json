He can't sleep because of the man's snoring, so he cuts loose the man's hammock with a knife, sending him flying straight to the river. When the dog hears the man's scream for help, he grips the knife in his mouth, and seeing this, the man blames the dog for what's happened. Later, the panther attaches the little man's hammock above the campfire, and sends the tent with the man in it floating down the river towards a waterfall. Every time the dog gets the blame, making the man hate his pet.","popularity":0.3245,"poster_path":"/dA41GSrUVMC0b7SMTU3Atj9XquG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock-A-Bye Pinky","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121216,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Hawley Pratt","original_name":"Hawley Pratt","popularity":0.3637,"profile_path":"/eWILFLR1cCUbstcHk8pIJibpmn5.jpg","credit_id":"56a40355c3a368388b00424b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148151,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John W.
