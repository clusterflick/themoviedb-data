Setting out as a free collective in the early 70ies, soon the social experiment emerged as a totalitarian system, which, 20 years later, ended in a dramatic failure. Through the eyes of these children, the film looks back at the community and examines what has become of the children of this utopia.","popularity":0.1032,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14547,"logo_path":"/ubSOjyWFqQG4E1kaJmvPdOQ52qR.png","name":"unafilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of the Commune","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2066525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Schlothauer","original_name":"Nina Schlothauer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/d9ZL5lRjJM2IEMjigKrnm4UlONE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b263a860e0a2666fd00edb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2066526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico Aimar","original_name":"Nico Aimar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b263a940e0a26671d00dda6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Muehl","original_name":"Otto Muehl","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/dryBVaK9qV7NCoGX4FYrYKXM8jk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b263a9c0e0a26672500d60d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2066528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Dubois","original_name":"Patricia Dubois","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b263aab0e0a261e0500e21a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2066529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Attila Muehl","original_name":"Attila Muehl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b263abac3a36841fc00c93e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2066530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Simanowitz","original_name":"Andy Simanowitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b263ad00e0a26672900d722","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2071177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wencke Mühleisen","original_name":"Wencke Mühleisen","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/ks2et29reYk4rvWg5TbyfqXZEyP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5b2f4bc00e0a2655af002492","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614700,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juliane Grossheim","original_name":"Juliane Grossheim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5728acb29251411475000e2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614700,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juliane Grossheim","original_name":"Juliane Grossheim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5797b3b0c3a36829400014cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Muehl","original_name":"Otto Muehl","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/dryBVaK9qV7NCoGX4FYrYKXM8jk.jpg","credit_id":"5b263ae0c3a36841e700c280","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599485,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sandra Merseburger","original_name":"Sandra Merseburger","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b263af7c3a36841d400bf06","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1659325","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
