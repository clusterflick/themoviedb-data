But his trade union documentary A Question of Leadership, intended for national ITV broadcast, was criticised by the Independent Broadcasting Authority for its explicitly anti-government stance. It was eventually screened a year later, exclusively in the Midlands (tx. 13/8/1981). Believing that the then-new Channel 4 would be more amenable to politicised documentaries, Loach proposed the four-part Questions of Leadership (1983), a wider-ranging study of the trade union movement - but on viewing the completed programmes' strong criticism of leading trade unionists, an anxious Channel 4 shortened the series to two parts and proposed screening a 'balancing' documentary by a different filmmaker, before scrapping the broadcast altogether.","popularity":0.5889,"poster_path":"/gxsVjmsQezAIDUJHO1V1pclo4Uk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34703,"logo_path":"/pZ4IVMy5M2742GwXqBIE8EkQiOA.png","name":"Associated Television (ATV)","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Question of Leadership","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Questions of Leadership","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Loach","original_name":"Ken Loach","popularity":0.7038,"profile_path":"/vGtkrPgNeK3xkbbKTQ4vWD1VsEm.jpg","credit_id":"61284e1b5ed96200266c29e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206943,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Davey","original_name":"John Davey","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/sMVAde2oDpRiRKLBWfgmvnmhtHN.jpg","credit_id":"61284e2274d6c00043849cfa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8969,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Menges","original_name":"Chris Menges","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/nmjNp6Sx1G9NCjn2jaLhScjyiUX.jpg","credit_id":"61284e28f29d66008fc285b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2529974,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roger James","original_name":"Roger James","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61284e2f74d6c00043849d40","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1454238,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Boulton","original_name":"Andrew Boulton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61284f005ed962004506ff46","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Loach","original_name":"Ken Loach","popularity":0.7038,"profile_path":"/vGtkrPgNeK3xkbbKTQ4vWD1VsEm.jpg","credit_id":"56a80aa4c3a36828af002698","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0388358","wikidata_id":"Q21188016","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxsVjmsQezAIDUJHO1V1pclo4Uk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":521}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"ATV","release_date":"1981-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
