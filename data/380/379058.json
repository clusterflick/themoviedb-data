A young woman, Rose, is tasked by her developer father to deliver an eviction notice to a reclusive woman in a ramshackle farmhouse. The woman has strange powers, derived from the house itself. The enchantress puts Rose and her friend, Greta, under a spell. They become lost in a seemingly infinite cornfield and must repeat a series of surreal or terrifying events in order to solve the mystery and break the spell. Rose's father is drawn into the mystery, and Rose's relationship with him is tested. A series of shocking reversals leads to a haunting climax.","popularity":2.7954,"poster_path":"/qIz54iM64dagv6CbPzHnlqtkpFC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rows","origin_country":""},{"id":133298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storysolver Film Lab","origin_country":""},{"id":133299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Labyrinth 7","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Was I the same when I woke up this morning?","title":"Rows","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":62823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Schick","original_name":"Hannah Schick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Rose White","credit_id":"59e952389251410c12003a17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1070061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Lakis","original_name":"Lauren Lakis","popularity":0.3792,"profile_path":"/yp7QGPid1nLjOyk5wIQ81ftEwDt.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Greta Glenn","credit_id":"59e952479251412cf5001e4f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Hughes","original_name":"Kenneth Hughes","popularity":0.2335,"profile_path":"/hPGHPxLZ009frraZc82rWrxIiSZ.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Mark White","credit_id":"59e952589251410c16003922","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2625805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Murray","original_name":"Nancy Murray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Haviland","credit_id":"5eb07e97a13533001d727ba6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Basile","original_name":"Joe Basile","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/1HxJCnVfcxeD3NXGEEqTdwjYrcG.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Jack Briar","credit_id":"59e952619251410c1600392f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin Hill","original_name":"Kevin Hill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6054d2b31d820f006b5023b0","department":"Sound","job":"Dialogue Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Basile","original_name":"Joe Basile","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/1HxJCnVfcxeD3NXGEEqTdwjYrcG.jpg","credit_id":"59e950e69251410c12003856","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Cammarata","original_name":"Rebecca Cammarata","popularity":0.0994,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e952059251412c87001bec","department":"Crew","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1376864,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David W.
