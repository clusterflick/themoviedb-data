Intrigued at this idea, the Pink Panther dons a trench coat, hat, and pipe and walks nonchalantly on city streets, looking for enemy spies. He comes upon a gang of foreign agents scheming to detonate a series of black-ball bombs, and when they realize he is following them, they shoot him with guns, lure him into a crocodile trap, and, under cover of darkness aboard a train, replace his cigarette with a bomb.","popularity":0.5461,"poster_path":"/rU1N75pimrfElVBSprPTZaM0pwt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-05-13","revenue":2221487,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pinkfinger","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Barry","original_name":"Dave Barry","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/sjBsu8FAne6NIJ77h1LLYqTWgYg.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Spy (voice)","credit_id":"56a447a0c3a3683890005ae5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"56a447b0c3a368389b0052ca","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1260884,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Kurtz","original_name":"Bob Kurtz","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a447c3c3a368388b0054ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"56a447d192514144ba004791","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121216,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Hawley Pratt","original_name":"Hawley Pratt","popularity":0.3637,"profile_path":"/eWILFLR1cCUbstcHk8pIJibpmn5.jpg","credit_id":"56a447e2c3a3683893005039","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932733,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laverne Harding","original_name":"Laverne Harding","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f572e4c3a3686a61000057","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596097,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"George DeLado","original_name":"George DeLado","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f572bbc3a3686a5e00003a","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173626,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Norm McCabe","original_name":"Norm McCabe","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/fiXZHKpQmLD5SKjl31EtdMAWsLg.jpg","credit_id":"56f5730bc3a3686a5e000048","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555752,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Don Williams","original_name":"Don Williams","popularity":0.0529,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f572f792514155f5000035","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595271,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bill Orcutt","original_name":"Bill Orcutt","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f5725292514155f5000020","department":"Production","job":"Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"56f571fcc3a3686a6b000033","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David H.
