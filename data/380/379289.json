His girlfriend is pregnant, he’s just lost his job, his mother is deserting him for a career move to New York City, and his divorced dad (Willie Boy Walker) can barely afford the small office space in which they live. Morgan’s most pressing problem is whether or not to register for the draft, and Walker, in a bravura performance, shares a real-life story of how he avoided military service in the late 1960’s. After a series of fateful encounters, Morgan finally saves his sanity by baking a cake.\" (from Fandor.com)","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":"/LLXNGkuhxIzznz9GGPev6oaQQr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84514,"logo_path":null,"name":"L.L.
