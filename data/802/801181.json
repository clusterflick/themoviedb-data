During a search of Naso’s home for probation violations, the officer finds a shocking cache of materials: thousands of pictures of women in hosiery, mannequins dressed in lingerie, and a journal recounting dozens of sexual assaults. But the most important piece of evidence found is Naso’s “List of Ten,” a handwritten list with ten cryptic entries of vague locations, but no names or dates. Investigators fear that they have stumbled upon a hidden serial killer and his list of victims completely by chance. Working against time, investigators have one year to decode the list before Naso goes free.","popularity":0.0675,"poster_path":"/am6osD7FcdijPEDPmtA0wnMQJNs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
