There she grows fonder of her new husband's half-brother, sparking a fatal love triangle between the three of them.  In a perfect synergy of the arts, choreographers Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Damien Jalet, together with the legendary performance artist Marina Abramovic, stage Pelléas et Mélisande as a cosmic dream. Like Debussy through his impressionistic music, the performers and creators of this production dispense with any illustration and instead bring out the hidden emotions of the characters.","popularity":0.0596,"poster_path":"/uo4eUDTuFOjsW28MIWOOCUtanHB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelléas et Mélisande - Genève","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Imbrailo","original_name":"Jacques Imbrailo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"603ccdde60c51d00518160da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mari Eriksmoen","original_name":"Mari Eriksmoen","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"603ccde560c51d00518160e0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1114625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Melrose","original_name":"Leigh Melrose","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6Gs8DtxL9lyZxEL4PsRjQdwghvY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"603ccded62620800516038aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Naef","original_name":"Yvonne Naef","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"603ccdfb0c4c1678d8b38558","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2994564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Lys","original_name":"Marie Lys","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"603cce0442f19f0bbc603d48","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Hopkins","original_name":"Justin Hopkins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"603cce0c3e09f37d58f09753","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2707661,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Nott","original_name":"Jonathan Nott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603cce1b6d1bb2005364df65","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1811287,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Damien Jalet","original_name":"Damien Jalet","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/ySTHr5O2siCy7tSlm4rw1qQ2B6r.jpg","credit_id":"603cce2a98f1f1004fefd7d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uo4eUDTuFOjsW28MIWOOCUtanHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
