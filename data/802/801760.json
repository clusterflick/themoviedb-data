Sitting at the breakfast table, a man (who is never fully visible) consults the railway timetable, drinks a cup of tea and calls a taxi. While it waits outside, the man has to replace his shoelace, because it breaks. The taxi takes him to the station through heavy urban traffic. He pays the driver and enters the station. The film follows a scenario similar to the one Joris Ivens wrote for a so-called 'I film'.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1932-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weekday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
