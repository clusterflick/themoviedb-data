In ECHOES OF WAR, children left behind in Afghanistan, Colombia, Sierra Leone and New York take us into their lives and share their memories, nightmares and dreams. A Colombian boy takes us down the road where his hand disappeared. In New York, two girls tell us about their father, who worked on too high a floor of the World Trade Centre. We meet a girl in Afghanistan who struggles to remember her father of whom even the pictures were burned. In Sierra Leone a family on their way to a well is attacked, leaving a girl behind who has no idea what the rebels were fighting for. A boy in the Colombian jungle dreams of becoming a doctor. A girl in a besieged city is determined to become president of her country and outlaw all weapons. The children reveal these stories by listening to the tale of a little elephant who tries to find the courage to live with the death of his father.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/3l3hsiAOA0TxWgQ44X9xPIHsZy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Pushto","iso_639_1":"ps","name":"پښتو"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes of War","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1089540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joop van Wijk","original_name":"Joop van Wijk","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603bf3de42f19f004e60660c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557668,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Dop","original_name":"Jan Dop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603bf455e267de006a504d78","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Melle van Essen","original_name":"Melle van Essen","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603bf44598f1f10054ef18a6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0449586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3l3hsiAOA0TxWgQ44X9xPIHsZy1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
