Scheffer interlaces the images with interviews with Dun, stage director Pierre Audi and librettist Xu Ying, about the opera and the role tea and oriental philosophy play in this work. Using monochrome, sometimes abstract images (in yellow, blue, red and green), close-ups of plants and flowers and images of the Chinese nature and people (sometimes accelerated or decelerated, sometimes in black-and-white), he mirrors the stylised opera performance and Dun's reflective music.","popularity":0.1113,"poster_path":"/7ybKi7uTuQ5XFnArOUkV6zfXMVM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegri Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Scheffer","original_name":"Frank Scheffer","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/piQhmwyj1yCMJDZ79W8tgQLGAH.jpg","credit_id":"603a3d12c2ff3d005205d685","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Scheffer","original_name":"Frank Scheffer","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/piQhmwyj1yCMJDZ79W8tgQLGAH.jpg","credit_id":"603a3d204bfa54004db846ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2992522,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pay-Uun Hiu","original_name":"Pay-Uun Hiu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603a3d2fdb705833e1f75eb4","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Melle van Essen","original_name":"Melle van Essen","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603a3d634d6791005dbe2570","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7706834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2122,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ybKi7uTuQ5XFnArOUkV6zfXMVM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":4262,"name":"tea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
