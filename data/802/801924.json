Stepping is performed informally during parties as well as more formally during organized step shows. This film explores this tradition, its historical roots as well as its contemporary forms, styles and uses, to understand how students construct various levels of identity through this dance formâ€¦African American identity, fraternity or sorority identity, gendered identity and personal identity. The film goes behind the scenes with the Alpha Phi Alphas as they prepare for a step show that is only a few hours away. Cutting between this show and interviews with current and past steppers as well as footage from previous shows, the film provides a broad picture of this vibrant and dynamic dance form.","popularity":0.3891,"poster_path":"/z6tBy9zvgIslnRMlhAcQ2r9qXEB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150233,"logo_path":null,"name":"WTIU","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stepping","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996137,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve White","original_name":"Steve White","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603e6a164b6d9d004535a64c","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Mould","original_name":"Tom Mould","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603e69dbd236e6005a7c1a0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brooke Barnett","original_name":"Brooke Barnett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603e69e92f8d09002a12eeb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Mould","original_name":"Tom Mould","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603e6c8122931a004555ac3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996138,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Scott Carmichael","original_name":"Scott Carmichael","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603e6a2fcffeed0070dc226f","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brooke Barnett","original_name":"Brooke Barnett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603e6c782dffd8002bbf5029","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1029,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z6tBy9zvgIslnRMlhAcQ2r9qXEB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":731}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246,"name":"dancing"},{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":187246,"name":"dance group"},{"id":251436,"name":"african american history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
