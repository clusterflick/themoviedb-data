Although the kiss reached its supreme expression as the on-screen replacement for copulation in post-Code Hollywood, Ferguson's material is drawn largely from silent classics and the less-fetishized European cinema of around 1960. She compares her film to a patchwork quilt, but it's basically morphological, cataloguing clusters of shots where kisses are delivered to the hand, the neck, rained down on a beloved face, perfunctorily bestowed on a spouse, awarded to dogs, dolls, gun, etc.\"  - J.
