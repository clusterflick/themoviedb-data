Two women gossip about a woman who committed suicide; a man sells tickets for a local tombola; a woman concerns herself about her elderly neighbour. By moving from person to person, the documentary gradually portrays this enigmatic city at the foot of the Vesuvius. James Baldwin once returned a writing assignment about Naples, because he utterly failed to grasp the city. A Neapolitan says: `Naples is a kaleidoscope of thousands of different souls. Their total defines the Soul of Naples.' The leitmotif is Caravaggio's painting Seven Works of Mercy (1607), made for an aristocratic charity that still exists. The documentary mirrors Caravaggio's clair-obscure in its patterns of poverty and wealth. Age-old alleys with subdued light contrast with the glittering chic of a genteel club. Slow aerial shots and poetic texts in voice-over interweave the separate stories.","popularity":0.1641,"poster_path":"/gLx4zgwXXMKTpHcJ2WGOCqXEGba.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Memphis Features","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Souls of Naples","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Monnikendam","original_name":"Vincent Monnikendam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c1309c43999b0184caa3b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Melle van Essen","original_name":"Melle van Essen","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603aa3b1140bad003c3f4bd4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492861,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cécile van Eijk","original_name":"Cécile van Eijk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603aa388edeb430058541486","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherman De Jesus","original_name":"Sherman De Jesus","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603aa394d8e22514f1d086ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Monnikendam","original_name":"Vincent Monnikendam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603aa379d9554b004d923c1e","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2992897,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lejo Siepe","original_name":"Lejo Siepe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603aa3a192e55b004cfe5e6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0457535","wikidata_id":"Q2228783","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1214,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLx4zgwXXMKTpHcJ2WGOCqXEGba.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":809}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4648,"name":"naples, italy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
