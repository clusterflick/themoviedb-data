Mizgir ends up in St. Petersburg in the guards regiment. Resourceful, quick-witted, cheerful, he easily copes with his official duties and, although he often gets punished by the sergeant-major for his pranks, he never loses heart. But then sad news came from the village: the old people’s cow had died, and Eremey’s bride Dunya was being relentlessly pursued by the clerk. The soldier felt sad. Standing on guard at the rich, diamond-studded icon of the Kazan Mother of God and thinking about how to help the elderly and the bride, Mizgir decides to take a desperate step. He breaks the glass of the icon and picks out a large gemstone from the aureole of the Mother of God. When the loss is discovered, Mizgir, without blinking an eye, announces that the Mother of God herself gave him the stone.","popularity":0.1401,"poster_path":"/mZIPS9YyZ6XIcn2UnsS6ybdD2qe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1922-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miracle-Maker","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Chudotvorets","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Miracle Maker","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2994639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raisa Mamontova","original_name":"Raisa Mamontova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aleksandra","credit_id":"603cedb0626208004f604539","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2994641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yelena Tumanskaya","original_name":"Yelena Tumanskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dunya","credit_id":"603cede562620877775f5931","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pyotr Kirillov","original_name":"Pyotr Kirillov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/mj8GOPTvce5R8d9odCqRv5J5VA2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yeremei Mizgir","credit_id":"603cee02ea39497582148cd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2994635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasili Kozhura","original_name":"Vasili Kozhura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nicholas I","credit_id":"603cee2c93bd69004cc12575","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lazar Antsi-Polovskiy","original_name":"Lazar Antsi-Polovskiy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"667e59cf57f1eafc3d7de1f5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1721693,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolay Kozlovsky","original_name":"Nikolay Kozlovsky","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6191ea1f4581990064c4b16f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2994654,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrei Zarin","original_name":"Andrei Zarin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603cee59e267de006a5115fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Panteleyev","original_name":"Aleksandr Panteleyev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603cee4ee267de78765021a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0013393","wikidata_id":"Q7751624","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mZIPS9YyZ6XIcn2UnsS6ybdD2qe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uMdYpob4CxQLiapkBa26FAbl2Sb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Petrograd","release_date":"1922-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow","release_date":"1922-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
