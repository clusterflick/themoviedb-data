Against a backdrop of economic decline, art students Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh experimented with early synthesisers to create sounds which would inspire a new generation of pop music with their first band The Human League. When this fractured, Ian and Martyn recruited singer and old friend Glenn Gregory to form Heaven 17. Penthouse and Pavement, their first album, was released in 1980 and was a landmark in UK pop history, combining electronica with pop hooks.","popularity":0.08,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven 17: The Story of Penthouse and Pavement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2529227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Gregory","original_name":"Glenn Gregory","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d4efc712b10e00de5b1cf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1481426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Ware","original_name":"Martyn Ware","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d4f06f12b10e00b5706b33","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4597068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
