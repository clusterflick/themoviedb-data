As she sits in the cellar reading, she hears voices plotting against the government. She thinks the voices are from another world but they actually belong to a group of German spies. The agents plan to acquire the important invention of a young man named Ingleton, who is staying at the camp under the guardianship of Captain Lane. Joan relates this information to the captain, with whom she is in love, but he at first refuses to believe her. Later, however, he learns that the plot is real, and with Joan's help, he captures the spies.","popularity":0.1811,"poster_path":"/AfxdKr9U0PbDjloRZCSAWatK9PE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joan of Plattsburg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joan","credit_id":"603cebc28d1b8e00618da3dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Elliott","original_name":"Robert Elliott","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":"/qYExhk4bwDE4nTRa3d6n3PLNFdJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Capt.
