Using the cut-up techniques of William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin, I edited this film using experimental out-takes and guided purely by intuition. The film sat around for a year without a soundtrack. Then, due to a homophobic incident, I plotted my revenge, locked myself in a sound booth and let loose. A revenge film that will have you falling out of your seat.","popularity":0.1179,"poster_path":"/9xxCgTjx5qcP0BnxwGDC2JOXwyo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homophobia Is Known To Cause Nightmares","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2326702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Handelman","original_name":"Michelle Handelman","popularity":0.3811,"profile_path":"/2hmYmMWGeXMzaIZzYRn95bxpxfv.jpg","credit_id":"603b06fe0716500050684777","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9xxCgTjx5qcP0BnxwGDC2JOXwyo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
