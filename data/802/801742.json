A nighttime sequence shows people gathering in an unidentified village for music in a cosy pub.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":"/4lGYIhgd8UKNTF8LE9xdRgVjMWe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1977-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reflections – Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728182,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pat Duffner","original_name":"Pat Duffner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb6c47f925320085332f0f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paddy Moloney","original_name":"Paddy Moloney","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb6c5c813cb60096aa0db4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"63eb6c7bf925320079c8c7ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465722,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Spencer","original_name":"John Spencer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb6cfc1f3e6000a1c4e96d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"63eb6d141b7294007c498c1a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"603d99aa4b9bae002abe3f1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0216151","wikidata_id":"Q123287516","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4lGYIhgd8UKNTF8LE9xdRgVjMWe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
