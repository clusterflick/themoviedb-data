It was a decade dominated by super teams: the Big Red Machine, the flamboyant Oakland A's, and the turbulent New York Yankees. We were treated to the final glory of Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente, and Bob Gibson, and thrilled by the excellence of Tom Seaver, Reggie Jackson, and Johnny Bench. It was astroturf, the DH and polyester uniforms. It was Yaz, Pops, and Catfish. It was free agency, fantastic bloopers, and Fisk's home run. Baseball in the '70s, a decade of glory.","popularity":0.0692,"poster_path":"/rjLJfnz8cFa0F3L80hjcLyfUT3V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baseball in the '70s","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Allen","original_name":"Mel Allen","popularity":0.1345,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64b703ef15794a013ef12832","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180165,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Durand","original_name":"Mark Durand","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b70408ec0c58014957b3fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4169283,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Kostel","original_name":"Michael Kostel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b70437ec0c5800addfe457","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548746,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geoff Belinfante","original_name":"Geoff Belinfante","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b7044bcaa50800c50fd51b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rjLJfnz8cFa0F3L80hjcLyfUT3V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3awyfA93C3Q2T6rvadudP8bs31C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hFII9is3dAmpDjBlDZQAuThUGj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VHS","release_date":"1991-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
