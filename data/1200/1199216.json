When the film is shot, the rock singer Hasse is 24 years old; he lives in Stockholm. The camera follows him through his days, to the rock club, to the stage, to meetings with friends, parents and girls. He meets Johanna, who is 16, and what is called infatuation, eventually love, arises. How does Hasse now create a place for himself in life, how do they build up their community? Both are big-city children, raised in welfare Sweden, which perhaps no longer provides welfare but has created an emptiness, a meaninglessness.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/pRIy0LyiJRovSbAHITeYujCTiJq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111586,"logo_path":null,"name":"SAFTRA","origin_country":""},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hemligheten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Hartleb","original_name":"Rainer Hartleb","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/zbZyPe3wYPdDi3EQRGHrOCk9dZI.jpg","credit_id":"654223181ac29200c494a294","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427973,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Staffan Lindqvist","original_name":"Staffan Lindqvist","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65422367e1ad79012c9097f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0084063","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pRIy0LyiJRovSbAHITeYujCTiJq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2743,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vz0k4GL2ERbMEDbYbWaUjOkA0Hj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1829}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"Btl","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"1982-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
