Throughout the night, moments of comedic bickering between the charismatic and quick-witted men are juxtaposed with moments of violence, hatred, fear, insomnia, and threats of death. The saga is like a sustained duet in an opera, set against a backdrop of threatening, overweight, or possibly imaginary forces. As Evo and Darm attempt to understand why the neighbor and/or other locals would declare war on them, it becomes evident that the two men are outsiders, gourmets, and brandy aficionados, and those sins may be reason enough.","popularity":0.1233,"poster_path":"/vl0PbBzxdlSVX5D6QiEZbkwdUBp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valkyrie Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are we on the brink of a new American civil war?","title":"Dog Bites Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2599776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Rogers","original_name":"Andrew Rogers","popularity":0.5442,"profile_path":"/oSBBuN3SWGeYIsIm1RkyK7qWPLj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Darm","credit_id":"654428cf9d6e3306c90f03a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cade Morrison","original_name":"Cade Morrison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Evo","credit_id":"654428da2866fa011bcdf084","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisamarie Costabile","original_name":"Lisamarie Costabile","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":"/xXFvnDBkAvjrJeO2U9iPYQqwgtx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"News Anchor","credit_id":"67a1d6e50f96f416df030197","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5224010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Everett Szucs","original_name":"Gene Everett Szucs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Radio Announcer","credit_id":"67a1d6fc9a24fca660261d6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5224012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Zambrano-Koka","original_name":"Luke Zambrano-Koka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67a1d70b69038ddb47e2cd20","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4354153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Zambrano","original_name":"Vincent Zambrano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654428ed8c7b0f00c6f88be8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633463,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brian Timmons","original_name":"Brian Timmons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654428f82866fa0138a5802b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4354155,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frederick Kirwin","original_name":"Frederick Kirwin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65563dbfea84c7109400c269","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4354154,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Scott Kahn","original_name":"Scott Kahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65563dcdd051d900c6efe08b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27903285","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acilW9GJsiuyW9lU6tsKn7VwOe2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1634,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vl0PbBzxdlSVX5D6QiEZbkwdUBp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
