A poet and songwriter who collaborates with the biggest names in Romani music, the 54-year old lives a life of modest means with his family in Shutka, Macedonia. Stored in the corner of his one-room house is a tottering, ceiling-high stack of handwritten, 25,000-word, multi-dialect dictionary of the oldest and most obscure words in the Romani language, which he has painstakingly collected over 35 years. When he's invited to the International Biennial of Poets held in Paris, he sees the trip as an opportunity to have his dictionary published. A testament to the endurance of a people who have been scattered across Europe, the dictionary is not only a work of art but also a rare link to a divided past.","popularity":0.1833,"poster_path":"/Al8DzNkGk9qs9Ai495QQNIs9bGL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flames of God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muzafer Bislim","original_name":"Muzafer Bislim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6543a7ea6beaea010b319d45","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meshakai Wolf","original_name":"Meshakai Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a7f92866fa00ab0fa0d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3631253,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pamela Cohn","original_name":"Pamela Cohn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a82eed2ac200c6436c2b","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meshakai Wolf","original_name":"Meshakai Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a85f41a5613368823c25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353223,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kosta Asmanis","original_name":"Kosta Asmanis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a8549cc67b013a2faed6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353222,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gregory Scarborough","original_name":"Gregory Scarborough","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a842e1ad79012c914083","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meshakai Wolf","original_name":"Meshakai Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a83741a561336b7651ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Chopinaud","original_name":"Pierre Chopinaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a806ed2ac200aeb08e81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meshakai Wolf","original_name":"Meshakai Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a8127719d7011c928539","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Chopinaud","original_name":"Pierre Chopinaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543a81e41a561336d8313ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7296714","wikidata_id":"Q108782380","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1365,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/Al8DzNkGk9qs9Ai495QQNIs9bGL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":910}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258407,"name":"romani people"},{"id":298106,"name":"ancient language film"},{"id":299889,"name":"romani"},{"id":304159,"name":"endangered language"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
