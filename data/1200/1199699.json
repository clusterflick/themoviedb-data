Britain’s ‘First Lady of Jazz’ became a star after joining The John Dankworth Seven in the 1950s and then marrying the bandleader. Internationally renowned for her mastery of the ‘scat’ singing style, and with a voice that has been described as ‘one of the richest contraltos in recording history’, Cleo has now enjoyed over six decades of success and acclaim here and across the world.  These are the highlights of her extraordinary career, with classic songs like Send in the Clowns and I Love You, Porgy, and duets with John Williams, Dudley Moore, Tony Bennett, and of course, her musical partner and fellow jazz legend Johnny Dankworth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dyXWCZ9YLtI7H7VHq2q0q0FYnlb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cleo Laine at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gvjfzrVXHhq7sC7Y30geqHufZmk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dyXWCZ9YLtI7H7VHq2q0q0FYnlb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
