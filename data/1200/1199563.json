Seattle welcomed the world to the University of Washington campus where visitors walked among palaces, saw new inventions that would change the world, and mined for mirth on the Paystreak - AYP’s Midway. Featuring thousands of historical images, rare archival footage, and contemporary interviews, the film explores the fair’s historical reverberations.","popularity":0.616,"poster_path":"/1PZQHOYDHvUHjFGv3P8G6f6HAD3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80491,"logo_path":"/1j5KqxYsOPf5Zv4Og56XQboR4eS.png","name":"Fidget Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seattle’s Forgotten World’s Fair: The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Skerritt","original_name":"Tom Skerritt","popularity":2.0774,"profile_path":"/oWFCyBLm1lsbsbT5Nmx3SPMaqFZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"654302172866fa0138a4e881","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667862,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom McGurk","original_name":"Tom McGurk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543025f2866fa0138a4e8a4","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4275082,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Perlman","original_name":"Eric Perlman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654302396beaea010b312c96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993958,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gayle Podrabsky","original_name":"Gayle Podrabsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543024b1ac292011b3c7b43","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667860,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Forsen","original_name":"John Forsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654301f0b09bde0102f66baf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197543,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christina Ruddy","original_name":"Christina Ruddy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654302036beaea00eaf5e257","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667860,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Forsen","original_name":"John Forsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654301e5a5890200c91a2eb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1542593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1PZQHOYDHvUHjFGv3P8G6f6HAD3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":225827,"name":"world's fair"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"PBS (KCTS)","release_date":"2009-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"The Seattle Channel","release_date":"2009-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
