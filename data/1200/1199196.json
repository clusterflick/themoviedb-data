Mostly it is Manfred behind the camera. He follows Kristjan’s encounters and drunken conversations with the self-proclaimed cinema pioneer Eedi. Chess master Eedi can barely walk and can’t hear, but bitterly scorns Kristjan for filmmaking. Unstoppable dreamer, Kristjan continues to imagine a long-postponed film about the painter Jüri Arrak with never-ending hope to leave a mark in Estonian culture.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/rmfCcjWN67mz00KM3N3hM6pXirf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73069,"logo_path":"/kduAeBBaa7Te5jdNL9NFV2OnbS3.png","name":"Filmivabrik","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2023-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spit in My Face","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595822,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kristjan Svirgsden","original_name":"Kristjan Svirgsden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lcDX3xPHtqxMZqHYsVV8qA3UPFj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6544a41a1ac292011b3d60c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737771,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edvard Oja","original_name":"Edvard Oja","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/z1kZDW5ggE5u4IEv5Da6S0xcAy2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6544a4267719d70139a460a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Vainokivi","original_name":"Manfred Vainokivi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vNwDtCRWcI6fYRlu6jN0nCvx2ev.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6544a430fd4f8000e47e8442","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Vainokivi","original_name":"Manfred Vainokivi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vNwDtCRWcI6fYRlu6jN0nCvx2ev.jpg","credit_id":"65420e3613654500ae4680cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1337369,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kersti Miilen","original_name":"Kersti Miilen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/l6IITqRPtVVYdjxaL1VAowCRjsE.jpg","credit_id":"6544a38dfd4f8000ae29957f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595301,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harmo Kallaste","original_name":"Harmo Kallaste","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/rItJhBwIjD6c2EqNCN0nxsijPmL.jpg","credit_id":"6544a383fd4f80011ecff39d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Vainokivi","original_name":"Manfred Vainokivi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vNwDtCRWcI6fYRlu6jN0nCvx2ev.jpg","credit_id":"6544a3679cc67b00c4429287","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593797,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marju Lepp","original_name":"Marju Lepp","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/utwDe0XJCDwLjiBJEjkeF0g8hI1.jpg","credit_id":"6544a3789cc67b011cee4b6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Vainokivi","original_name":"Manfred Vainokivi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vNwDtCRWcI6fYRlu6jN0nCvx2ev.jpg","credit_id":"6544a36c7719d700e2afcb02","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kTJaPJPKpTVUPWBD5JlR6T8CFFA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/rmfCcjWN67mz00KM3N3hM6pXirf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
