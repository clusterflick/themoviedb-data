Many of them later grew up in orphanages or foster families, like the three main characters of this film, Ana (Biserka Ipša), Nenad (Mustafa Nadarević) and Toma (Božidar Orešković). Each of them relates in a different way to the past and the possibility that, as young accomplished adults, they can finally solve the secret of their identity and meet members of their real families.","popularity":0.281,"poster_path":"/zLmVb8pElhm3hfcyhluA6vMPFOf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27683,"logo_path":"/8CdlgpxGOc96xW2BytnE1LFR1HZ.png","name":"Televizija
