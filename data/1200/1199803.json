It doesn't take long, however, before he is arrested for bigamy. His first wife left him a few years ago, but Fridolf isn't very bright and he thought that she was dead when she wrote a letter to him saying that. She ran off to join a circus. By a coincidence, the circus is visiting Fridolf's home town and Fridolf goes to the circus with a free ticket. But at the circus all he can do is make a fool of himself.","popularity":0.253,"poster_path":"/A0oMT4RNsx54TRG9UwBKd4H09ZD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1763,"logo_path":"/mpT9ipd8lt4qMYzdnV8SN7VJdnA.png","name":"Europa Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fridolf i lejonkulan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fridolf Rhudin","original_name":"Fridolf Rhudin","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tokhSOcES5gbzUlpJtHk95HiiL5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fridolf Svensson","credit_id":"6543b2bd7719d700c51e6fbc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aino Taube","original_name":"Aino Taube","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/bEjAsxRypkJdjwDbgWUqAu3QQX8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Margit Vedholm","credit_id":"6543b2e7e1ad7900ea57f39b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik A.
