The film revolves around the relationship between Mark Twomey, whose girlfriend Serena is brutally murdered, and his best friend Lance, who is the murderer. The two men play an inescapable game of homoerotic cat and mouse as a rookie cop ruthlessly seeks the evidence to convict Mark of Serenas murder. Innocents are drawn into the tangled web of love and lies as Lance and Mark rush toward a final confrontation.","popularity":0.244,"poster_path":"/ukLq1BAHIwLFPaEXp4UXaHLRwdI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Knight Owl
