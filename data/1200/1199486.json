Reporter Linda Adey investigates the experiences of black and ethnic minority students at British unis and examines what happens when victims of racist abuse at university want to complain.  Linda’s journey starts in Manchester, where a 19-year-old student was held up against a wall by university security staff demanding to see his ID because, according to the student, they think he is a drug dealer and not a university student.  Linda’s investigation also leads her to students who experienced alleged racism at one Oxford college, Christ Church.  Linda finally gets to put the students’ experiences she has heard to the universities, but are they willing to admit to any failings? And can universities become safer places for black and ethnic minority students?","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":212504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perfect Storm Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is Uni Racist?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Adey","original_name":"Linda Adey","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self (presenter)","credit_id":"6542b781ed2ac200aeb01e9e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miki Mistrati","original_name":"Miki Mistrati","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6542b7ada58902012e45c705","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Webster","original_name":"Dean Webster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6542b79ae1ad7900ea575f78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC One","release_date":"2021-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
