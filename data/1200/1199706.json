From this series of unique archive performances, we learn that blues was their first love and Dave's signature guitar sound would go on to influence a generation of guitar players. As Ray's uniquely English songwriting style developed, the spectre of Ray and Dave's rocky fraternal relationship continually loomed in the background, through concerts for The Old Grey Whistle Test in the 1970s to appearances on Top of the Pops in the 1980s.  The inevitable band split came in 1996, and the BBC archive continues with Ray's reinvention as a solo artist with performances on the Electric Proms and up to the present day on Later... with Jools Holland. All the while, the brothers continue to tease and goad the press - and one another - with talk of a Kinks reunion.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dyXWCZ9YLtI7H7VHq2q0q0FYnlb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kinks at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400145,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephanie McWhinnie","original_name":"Stephanie McWhinnie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65437e739cc67b011cedca6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cooper","original_name":"Mark Cooper","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/l5xmotx7X1JVUQgwmgU60pnIOPB.jpg","credit_id":"65437e816beaea010b3182ce","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9RaXhGXW3o5zfPAIpU7AlhOoAdO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dyXWCZ9YLtI7H7VHq2q0q0FYnlb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2011-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
