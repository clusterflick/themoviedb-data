From the huge Scott monument on Princes Street Edinburgh, to Smailholm Tower in the Borders, from Loch Katrine - the setting for his most famous poem - The Lady of the Lake - to Doune Castle, a setting which continues to inspire historical novelists to this day - Damian takes us on a personal journey to discover the truth about the man, his world and his work.  With contributions from world experts: professor Alison Lumsden, Aberdeen University; novelist James Robertson; author of Scott-land Stuart Kelly and Abbotsford curator, Kirsty Archer-Thompson.  In Search of Sir Walter Scott reveals the long lasting influence of Scott and his writing, his political campaigning and his role in creating a version of Scotland we are still living with today.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/84RxB48P9F5FXlZqMvNBuvdexQs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of Sir Walter Scott","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damian Barr","original_name":"Damian Barr","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1xf6waYTwV3ehSf6geWGg8GC4BR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self (presenter)","credit_id":"6542b5c33e01ea011dcae32d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4351607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Fairbank","original_name":"Lisa Fairbank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6542b5e0ed2ac200aeb01e71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Houston","original_name":"Stewart Houston","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6542b60b41a56100acfc6c02","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2878354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Heathcote","original_name":"Julie Heathcote","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6542b61d9cc67b00df915cd8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":731,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2HYWVbURTbiYNedecJKu8O4X0ca.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/84RxB48P9F5FXlZqMvNBuvdexQs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Scotland","release_date":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
