A story woven from many threads about a man who deeply respected the environment in which he grew up and later worked. With his determination and great efforts, he moved the domestic cultural space alongside other European nations, which were experiencing their renaissance in the middle of the 19th century.

it.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/3m8qHvY7r7ROVjPTm4vo0jlVwBu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio
