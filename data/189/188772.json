The original documentary footage from 1915â€“1918 was somewhat supplemented in a small measure with some staged reenactments of Serbian army retreating over Albania, and later liberation of Belgrade. The first version of this documentary epic was shown in 1930 under the title \"For the Honour of Homeland\". Andrija Glisic and Zarija Djokic later made a new sound version of the previous silent movie and renamed it \"Fire Over the Balkans\".","popularity":0.2757,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1932-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Calvary of Serbia","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Calvary of Serbia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanislav Krakov","original_name":"Stanislav Krakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d439251416c75135663","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2966468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"},{"id":7492,"name":"serbia"},{"id":219945,"name":"calvary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
