This 2011 concert, Dances and Dreams, has a theme of dances (two Dvorak Slavonic Dances, Stravinksy’s Firebird Suite, Grieg’s Symphonic Dance, Richard Strauss’s Dance of the Seven Veils, and Brahms’ Hungarian Dance No. 1) and dreams (Ravel’s Alborado del Gracisoso and the famous Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor). This generous mix of romantic and impressionistic music shows off the magnificent Berlin ensemble at its best.  It is also great to see star pianist Evgeny Kissin at the keyboards.","popularity":0.089,"poster_path":"/83DDJC4KECCUfEXRhhcegMZTvYj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dances and Dreams Gala from Berlin - Sylvesterconzert 2011","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeny Kissin","original_name":"Evgeny Kissin","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/fawdqNRICujbfqpK4KHtONsQbHB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Piano","credit_id":"5dfa95d0d1a89300148143da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Rattle","original_name":"Simon Rattle","popularity":0.2831,"profile_path":"/erFlB9B08lVMhEj70bLUpkr28iA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dfa95e56097500012336a7b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1715946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henning Kasten","original_name":"Henning Kasten","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfa961465686e00188c96eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/83DDJC4KECCUfEXRhhcegMZTvYj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dances & Dreams - The Berliner Philharmoniker and Simon Rattle","key":"QaRepm32I-8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-08-31T12:35:54.000Z","id":"5dfa965765686e00138cfa46"}]}}}
