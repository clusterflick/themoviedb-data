A retired Marine Colonel reaches out to five men, a new generation returning from the battlefield. He brings them to the river. He puts a fly rod into their hand, teaches them to cast, and shares his secret: there are places where you can still be consumed by a simple act, find joy in a fight, and be redeemed as you gently release another creature, unharmed, into quiet waters.","popularity":0.1064,"poster_path":"/u5ZTb85uk2GYU9EZyPgmWeauLgQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Yet Begun to Fight","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1267507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shasta Grenier","original_name":"Shasta Grenier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/paAC8ewOoSV6G14wdN47jO9LKfD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d2e9251416c7513298d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Lee","original_name":"Sabrina Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d2e9251416c75132993","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2359197","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u5ZTb85uk2GYU9EZyPgmWeauLgQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
