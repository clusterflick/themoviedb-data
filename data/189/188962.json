Emotions run high since it is the one-year anniversary of the death of John's brother, the handsome and charismatic Tony, who had also been Lyle`s lover. Marian, who is still inconsolable after losing Tony to AIDS, is upset when Lyle brings his new boyfriend, a young artist, Robert. Meanwhile, the situation is just as tense at the Kerr`s neighbors' house, where oft-widowed, free spirit Laura Ponti gets a surprise visit from her resentful, angry daughter, Nina, and her married lover, Thierry. Matters worsen when the battling mother-daughter duo joins the Kerr household for a dinner party, where the pain-riddled diners engage in a messy emotional showdown.","popularity":1.6987,"poster_path":"/x2RjeGkohlfpovanrojyoHxMwiS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-06-28","revenue":32190,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's no future in holding on to the past.","title":"The Weekend","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gena Rowlands","original_name":"Gena Rowlands","popularity":1.2577,"profile_path":"/7Hda4UFbmpufKnk48KpBuH7j05j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Laura Ponti","credit_id":"52fe4d499251416c7513622d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brooke Shields","original_name":"Brooke Shields","popularity":2.2772,"profile_path":"/qpLcTp5D6t0S0TtNK85VOYwDmTL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"52fe4d499251416c75136231","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Kara Unger","original_name":"Deborah Kara Unger","popularity":0.9153,"profile_path":"/9CSLmsjOa4qfOimmuVe89V7s0Wf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marian Kerr","credit_id":"52fe4d499251416c75136235","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Harris","original_name":"Jared Harris","popularity":1.9763,"profile_path":"/r9nIq0jPz1oBm4WwtlZhqlsX8p0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Kerr","credit_id":"52fe4d499251416c75136239","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Conrad","original_name":"David Conrad","popularity":1.0501,"profile_path":"/3A8ZF3G6LfeHbYhGiwLjShueYyK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d499251416c7513623d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Duval","original_name":"James Duval","popularity":0.9076,"profile_path":"/vvasxKKPnxv2qOoXTnaXW3ecGLO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d499251416c75136241","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.
