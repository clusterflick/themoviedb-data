THE LAST POGO documents the raucous 1978 punk concert held in Toronto's legendary Horseshoe Tavern-a night of unhinged music and unbridled mayhem. On December 1, 1978, legendary Toronto concert promoters Gary Topp and Gary Cormier-better known as The Garys-presented The Last Pogo, a rollicking, riotous concert at the venerable Horseshoe Tavern. On the bill were seminal bands from Toronto's punk rock scene: The Scenics, The Cardboard Brains, The Secrets, The Mods, The Ugly, The Viletones and Teenage Head. During the concert, the frenetic energy of 800+ thrashing fans in the club boiled over and a near-riot ensued. Filmmaker Colin Brunton was there with a camera crew to capture it all, from the irreverent punk musicians and the slam-dancing audience to the police who tried to stop the show and the firefighters called in to escort people from the premises.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/xCqqr0cGNwcCg60Vx7mDpZI5eJN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Pogo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Lee","original_name":"Patrick Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a943419251411e11003a95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55191,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colin Brunton","original_name":"Colin Brunton","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":"/7vuYDlaWuS1RwYQ7lllmouAVQlN.jpg","credit_id":"55a9432bc3a3682ff900379d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0209094","wikidata_id":"Q7745944","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1444,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xCqqr0cGNwcCg60Vx7mDpZI5eJN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1043}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
