A sexual interpretation of inner violence, about out-of-work comedians living in a trailer park run by a soap opera star. The old comedians cannot work anymore due to their addictions, and come up with the filthiest, most offensive routines they can devise, to strike out at mainstream society, their only audience being themselves. When Bill recieves an eviction notice for having too many wild parties, he takes to the roof of his trailer with a rifle, and declares he is a victim of an 'aluminum holocaust.'","popularity":0.2935,"poster_path":"/vkIS2d3De0YUh1VeWct30VuJxjU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How
