Through its scale and popularity, throughout the 19th century, it marked the interest and curiosity of artists and writers for the countries of the West (the Maghreb) or the Levant (the Middle East). Orientalism was born from the fascination of the Ottoman Empire and followed its slow disintegration and the progression of European colonizations. This exotic trend is associated with all the artistic movements of the 19th century, academic, romantic, realistic or even impressionist. It is present in architecture, music, painting, literature, poetry... Picturesque aesthetics, confusing styles, civilizations and eras, orientalism has created numerous clichés and clichés that we still find today in literature or cinema.","popularity":0.2925,"poster_path":"/p2tjlERPCwo3d9ry5lTM6iKypPE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2381,"logo_path":"/hmzO0vmTZjfGoMoS5pykenpmHWH.png","name":"Musée
