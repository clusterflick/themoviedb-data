The film’s trench-coated protagonist is a walking shadow, a lonely silhouette that traverses painted and photographed cityscapes of 20th century New York City. The impressions and atmospheres invoked recall the late Peter B. Hutton’s NEW YORK PORTRAIT, to whom the film is dedicated.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/pfv9jcpJYz7hi4dbBPXtiD4Phl1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thin Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis Klahr","original_name":"Lewis Klahr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654fc306b09bde00c6d855dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1129,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pfv9jcpJYz7hi4dbBPXtiD4Phl1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":753}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
