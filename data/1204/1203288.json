In 1986, the event was rocked by a series of serious accidents, and a tragedy which would stun the sport.  An horrific helicopter accident in Mali killed five, including Dakar Rally founder Thierry Sabine. The tragedy shocked everyone involved in the 1986 event, but it was decided to complete the rally raid in Sabine's honour. So, 22 days after leaving Paris, the surviving cars, motorcycles and trucks rolled into Dakar, bringing an emotional end to the 15,000km adventure.  Treacherous terrain, wild weather, confusion and controversy made 1986 one of the toughest years for the Dakar Rally, with just 81 of the 478 competitors making the finish. This comprehensive review follows the dramatic story, with extraordinary action footage, interviews and rare behind-the-scenes access putting you at the heart of the 1986 Paris-Dakar Rally.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nqsexpl5CkVxj4GfnZGUexF5sLl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris-Dakar Rally 1986","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wrWxekEetpBQSZA0Pm0RAyPd0ax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":989,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqsexpl5CkVxj4GfnZGUexF5sLl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
