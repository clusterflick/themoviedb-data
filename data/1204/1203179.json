The absence is doubled, the ellipsis compounded. Jacir tells the parallel tale of Edmond Tamari, the transport company employee from Jaffa who, it is said, was told to take a bouquet of flowers to Lydda Airport and wait for Amelia Earhart to arrive so that he may welcome her to Palestine. The arrival never happened.
