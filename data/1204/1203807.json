The soldier lives in a so-called limbo of a future society where the one and the only law which is observed is \"homo homini lupus\"; he plays his personal chess game in a constant balance between the physical violence and the psychological torture, in a delirious climax whose highest point is an external act of becoming conscious of the situation. How long can a man resist under torture? How far can a man push his limits? But, above all, who is the mole?","popularity":0.0773,"poster_path":"/uOa37FEGrE5kNs1Z0G2kQk03L4q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"307-r","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoon C.
