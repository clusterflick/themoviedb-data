It was the beginning of radical transformation where iron was pitted against stone, engineering against architecture, and modern design against ancients. Press campaigns, lobbying, public conferences, denigration of opposing projects, bragging about big names - all participants engaged in a fierce battle without concession. Using 3D recreations, official sources (reports, letters, drawings...) and intimate archives obtained from their descendants, this film will bring to life this vertical race through a fresh and visual way to mark the centenary of Eiffel death.","popularity":1.0353,"poster_path":"/7qZ3NbzSgyXAfOKBg3Mjknx4wS3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":202839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinémage
