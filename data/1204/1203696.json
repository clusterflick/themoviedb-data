Over the course of his ten or eleven trips and extended stays, he established a familiarity with this space. Traveling through the different regions from north to south, he never ceases to note the differences. He is also the first artist, apart from Delacroix's Women of Algiers, to penetrate into female interiors and reveal the reality, far removed from the harem fantasies that reigned in his time. Fascinated by the country, its deserts and its inhabitants , going so far as to live like the Algerians, Gustave Guillaumet devoted his life and his painting to this country, breaking with the colorful and exotic representations of the time. The painting The Famine in Algeria, restored thanks to exceptional fundraising, was dictated by the events of the years 1865-1868, and well illustrates his knowledge of the country, in a manner that is at once demanding, sensitive and serious.","popularity":0.3334,"poster_path":"/e7tTC97VWXUFNw4E8hMZeIEEiqW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213304,"logo_path":"/49Gh47kS3tqnNmS4WDLSWdF6NB0.png","name":"7ALimoges","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Algérie de Gustave Guillaumet (1840-1887)","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4369874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustave Guillaumet","original_name":"Gustave Guillaumet","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/evuhIzQ3hzWYCCbuuWaXUATZhr2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Painter","credit_id":"654fd7d00816c700fd2d0639","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1w9pkOvkuxi9Idspym3vrhI4HRd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iCUI1NJhA6znUBfLbHjJk8Mn5Ax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tyqIm7T2e8SjVc53lhi6pW2o7DZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9V3WLjygymrKSSDy5cXim402jCI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bxF2TBwimVqlsxIvYBVzp96nldm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7tTC97VWXUFNw4E8hMZeIEEiqW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":198555,"name":"orientalism"},{"id":215277,"name":"arab culture"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":324637,"name":"berbere culture"},{"id":324840,"name":"gustave guillaumet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
