The house has to be emptied and sold, as Chantal can no longer afford it. A weekend to reconnect with their past and pack up all the memories they want to keep. The time they share, after a long period without living together, will demonstrate its passing. The suffocation caused by a slavish nostalgia and a change of pattern in their mother-son relationship. Old age, sexuality and empty nest syndrome appear at a turning point in their lives that will mark the direction of the road they have to travel together.","popularity":0.2091,"poster_path":"/eHM1zsntBgHzT96ubSeVH1G9kdh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bye Bye Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Almarcha","original_name":"Sonia Almarcha","popularity":0.2435,"profile_path":"/3dCeLMVuexRKeCIzjwv3c0JCpm6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"654eafcffd4f8000ae2dfccd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álvaro Larrán","original_name":"Álvaro Larrán","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/qOfhDrivnDAJhgfPRShjAFUJ8Jy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"654eafd62866fa108b6d8611","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1141778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Millà","original_name":"Marta Millà","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/hinO37klOky64Os87bXtlV1fGwB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"654eafe141a561336b7b145a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesc Orella","original_name":"Francesc Orella","popularity":0.2387,"profile_path":"/ytUgaou1XcuAG6U6HXEFROBegTv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"654eafe7d4653700fe3547a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1652596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Vilà","original_name":"Roger Vilà","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"654eaff0fd4f8000ae2dfcda","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iñaki Mur","original_name":"Iñaki Mur","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654eafc2fd4f80011ed4963a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iñaki Mur","original_name":"Iñaki Mur","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654eb00ffd4f800101b96d84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29534436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eHM1zsntBgHzT96ubSeVH1G9kdh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
