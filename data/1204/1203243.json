Viewers learn that the U.S. produces more food than any other country, with more corn grown than any other crop (followed by soybeans and wheat), occupying more than a billion acres from sea to shining sea. The program also points out that most young farmers are following the family tradition, and that about a third of those who till the soil today have attended college, which is not surprising, since modern agriculture requires knowledge of chemistry, weather, computers, and, of course, high-tech equipment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sjLLudCD1DmLwu44j5u5NzVETDY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Deere Action, Part 3","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1358,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sjLLudCD1DmLwu44j5u5NzVETDY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
