One day I started asking my musician friends if they want to sit and talk baseball in front of a camera. They all replied, “When are we doing this?” So, we packed up the van and hit the road. We grabbed some cameras and mics, met with some baseball fans and just started talking. We struck gold. Turns out there’s a whole bunch of musicians just waiting to share their opinions on the game, their own war stories, and even some tear-jerking love letters to baseball. You won’t be disappointed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baseball Furies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4368107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Dummeldinger","original_name":"Jason Dummeldinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e77aafd4f8000ae2def2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
