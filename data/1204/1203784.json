Let's follow them in their daily lives and in their actions in order to understand why they are doing this. For adrenaline, to convey political messages, or for artistic research.  Some very risky and very committed actions will be broadcast on French television, others will forever mark the streets of Paris.  This 60-minute documentary is a year-long immersion in French graffiti.","popularity":0.1836,"poster_path":"/uRuqdPWMzJoeCcGdlVWGeCCuzH6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Autoproduction","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary","title":"VANDAL GRAFFITI, INVISIBLE APPROACHES","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4370553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Hardi","original_name":"Jules Hardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655002e167b613013c4c68d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27720652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@juleshardi","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1243,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uRuqdPWMzJoeCcGdlVWGeCCuzH6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":829}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":2816,"name":"street art"},{"id":2016,"name":"vandalism"},{"id":324846,"name":"autoproduction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Available on Youtube","release_date":"2023-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Documentary - VANDAL GRAFFITI, INVISIBLE APPROACHES","key":"ph1u_cBT6aQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-14T17:18:02.000Z","id":"6550040bea84c70139a0cbf9"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"(Bande-annonce) GRAFFITI VANDAL - Les démarches invisibles","key":"qxuiMawmflE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-10-17T09:58:36.000Z","id":"6550045129383543f296e43a"}]}}}
