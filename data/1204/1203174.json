This energetic 19th-century ballet is enlivened by Ludwig Minkus’ spirited score, and is a wonderful showcase for the virtuosity of The Royal Ballet's Principal dancers. Created for The Royal Ballet a decade ago, Carlos Acosta’s exuberant production brings the sunshine and charm of Spain to the Main Stage with Tim Hatley’s characterful designs.","popularity":0.4128,"poster_path":"/d5ktHbpOevomDwj5L2100GVCdq6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Royal Ballet - Don Quixote","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Ball","original_name":"Matthew Ball","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/k2uWLdUrMzAylzoT8XffJnnLjNN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Basilio","credit_id":"654e4ccc2866fa10928c2cf4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mayara Magri","original_name":"Mayara Magri","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/lMtHnTXxmOim6ai10OpEac4QPDW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kitri","credit_id":"654e4ceed4fe0400ac32a71c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Gasparini","original_name":"Isabella Gasparini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oPhfXGeiqBpWt4wFH0oMq0ePWd3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Amour","credit_id":"654e4d2bd4653700c4e3df97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Avis","original_name":"Gary Avis","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/kZSHt0Q8eKkjWBSrhtyr6CQ0BRP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Don Quixote","credit_id":"654e4d35d46537011b4c08b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4367791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Boswell","original_name":"Liam Boswell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sancho Panza","credit_id":"654e4d4a2866fa108b6d6adc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2050882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Whitehead","original_name":"Thomas Whitehead","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/m0wcc5xGDjdyNIhMyoY8gjsD5ve.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lorenzo","credit_id":"654e4d5b67b61300afca32a6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hay","original_name":"James Hay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yvQeieZQB769oUGEeT3TcbzISY6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gamache","credit_id":"654e4d6bd4fe0401397e9fb4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calvin Richardson","original_name":"Calvin Richardson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/tJIJ2VH6ssZcV8yjjgPYBknIzoj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Espada","credit_id":"654e4d782866fa108fc786fc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leticia Dias","original_name":"Leticia Dias","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mercedes","credit_id":"654e4d835a5ed000ad58bd9e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3842235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sae Maeda","original_name":"Sae Maeda","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/7Velbe1b6179Dwk5VNTYf9yH0ht.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kitri's friend","credit_id":"654e4d9041a561336a258214","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Allnatt","original_name":"Sophie Allnatt","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Kitri's friend","credit_id":"654e4d9bd4fe0401397e9fc9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Buvoli","original_name":"Annette Buvoli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"The Queen of the Dryads","credit_id":"654e4dc067b613013c4ba3bb","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Grennell","original_name":"Hannah Grennell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Gypsy couple","credit_id":"654e4dd141a56133693d7b67","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentino Zucchetti","original_name":"Valentino Zucchetti","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/zFhzTJUvwGbvxv1Tl6yqRAw2HFf.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Gypsy couple","credit_id":"654e4de3d4fe04011b8dd04f","order":13}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d5ktHbpOevomDwj5L2100GVCdq6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
