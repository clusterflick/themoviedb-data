Now, 20 years later, the man who dug that hole tells the fantastical story of how he, an ordinary farmer, hid the deposed president beneath a flowerbed in his garden for eight months. On camera, he talks about the day his house was selected as a hideaway for this wanted man, hunted by 150,000 US soldiers. The Iraqi farmer had no choice but to assume the role of presidential hairdresser, physician and bodyguard—and something akin to a friendship seems to have grown between them as they ate together and helped wash each other’s backs.","popularity":0.2548,"poster_path":"/xceFYWG3YzSMkS9llWzJ2d4oyW3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hene Films AS","origin_country":""},{"id":209549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rudaw Media","origin_country":""},{"id":197984,"logo_path":"/g7ydoWPYAE9xKX7Od9HJ2uR17ec.png","name":"TV2 Nord (DK)","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2024-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hiding Saddam Hussein","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Halkawt Mustafa","original_name":"Halkawt Mustafa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e9481d4fe0400fe028cda","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janne Hjeltnes","original_name":"Janne Hjeltnes","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e948c29383543f2962b12","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67000,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kjell Vassdal","original_name":"Kjell Vassdal","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e946667b613013c4bb6d1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4368396,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anders Herein","original_name":"Anders Herein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e949e29383543f485a2d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Halkawt Mustafa","original_name":"Halkawt Mustafa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e942d67b61300c84ad04e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4368396,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anders Herein","original_name":"Anders Herein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e9474d4653700e1a77b06","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29414998","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fU2oeUzJompgtYmvgxuklZhgfhP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xceFYWG3YzSMkS9llWzJ2d4oyW3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yHmXu4qc3UDy4bpmk1d8DhuPje3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/Anw8wcp1af9BMgwK8jqMAKgrxgF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cDJHueF6jvMT9WwhItOrEdvq5sI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":341324,"name":"saddam hoessein"},{"id":341325,"name":"iraqi dictator"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"20.
