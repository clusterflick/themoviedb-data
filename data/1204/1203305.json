Being a central figure among the revolutionaries of the early Soviet Union, Kollontai was the first woman to be a cabinet minister and the first woman ambassador. Among other things, she championed for women’s liberation, helped organise the first International Women’s Day, worked to advance women’s labour, welfare, and education rights, and was an advocate for sexual emancipation, abortion rights, and civil partnerships instead of traditional marriage. After working in the Bolshevik government for a few years, she became sidelined and ostracised, and narrowly avoided her expulsion from the party by serving in several diplomatic posts outside Russia, including Norway, Mexico, and Sweden.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/bksKqJADjLAUSownRsHOlGYCQjB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dora García","original_name":"Dora García","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e93c62866fa108b6d7e64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085962,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vincent Pinckaers","original_name":"Vincent Pinckaers","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e93e9d4653700e1a77ad8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2119899,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miriam Ortiz Guzmán","original_name":"Miriam Ortiz Guzmán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e940a5a5ed0010040bb87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7JpHEb6mZ3fHPrB3GFpZZXOkrkM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/oSjMWMidSp2bhT8kXL112fY88xZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bksKqJADjLAUSownRsHOlGYCQjB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
