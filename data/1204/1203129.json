The protest demands policy and budget for disabled people living in the community. SADD’s year-long subway action, which began in December 2021, delays subway trains during rush hour, greets incoming trains at the platform, to call out to the public. On a busy commute, on a subway that doesn't move, some are silent, some cheer, and some swear. SADD claims, \"We want to move around together, to be educated together, to work together, and to live in the community together.\" Their repeated protests and actions on subway platforms have started to draw reaction from the government, the politicians, the media, and the citizens.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dYTI4YPYXhgSrFvPrSF2rnSqJn5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good morning Citizens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4367544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Min A-yeong","original_name":"Min A-yeong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654e321e29383543f2960d7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1006,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYTI4YPYXhgSrFvPrSF2rnSqJn5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":671}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul Disabled people Right's Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
