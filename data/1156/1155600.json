But even in their fixed state all these images refer to movement, either past or potential, for their manner of presentation. And this movement, which is necessarily frozen in the paintings and sculptures, is restored to its origins by Berardinone through the cinema. From her first work, Silent Invasion, she has reconstructed on film the impending descent of a mass of resin down a flight of stairs, this movement being repeated and emphasized through the use of a magnifying glass.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kY1h2hz6LYdvpDXfUITUAXE8TBb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Invasion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentina Berardinone","original_name":"Valentina Berardinone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bddf19ac6c7908e086c6fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kY1h2hz6LYdvpDXfUITUAXE8TBb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
