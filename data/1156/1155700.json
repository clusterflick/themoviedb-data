Celeste, Giorgia and Letizia are three young women as different as they come, but all are linked by a common element: as cisgender women, they are guests in the ballroom scene. A subculture originally born within the African American and Latine LGBTQ community of New York, it is now quite present in Italy as well. It is precisely here that the three women have found a safe space where they can be masters of their own bodies without judgement, prejudices, or provocation. They are about to embark on a journey that will make them grow up and reflect on choices they must make for themselves: while Giorgia is increasingly rooted to her city, Celeste and Letizia are preparing to leave. A year-long coming-of-age story that uncovers dreams, desires, doubts, and the will to fight and to keep on living.","popularity":0.1653,"poster_path":"/aumx8XGAHuclbtwlP22TB8Ds3c7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204774,"logo_path":"/jy4skProWZsbiq8r7W3h6PAMdOz.png","name":"Base
