Beauty, improvisation, melancholy, bawdiness - Purcell, Playford and their European contemporaries bang heads with ballads, ditties, elegies, sea-shanties and folk song. Along with a variety of classical stringed instruments, their own arrangements delight us in a joyful mix of vocals, percussion, harmonium, guitar, charango and storytelling.  Filmed on location in one of London's oldest taverns, The George Inn, Southwark.","popularity":0.0934,"poster_path":"/gMMFetvRxLbqBvJRO2QqvRpRJVs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ad Lib Productions Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alehouse Sessions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bjarte Eike","original_name":"Bjarte Eike","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65fda5ec770700017c0afdfc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Guthrie","original_name":"Tom Guthrie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65fda61337806201623806f1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Best","original_name":"Dominic Best","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fda5067f6c8d017c6f3a4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Best","original_name":"Dominic Best","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fda55c197de4018616b018","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608687,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Bruno","original_name":"Malcolm Bruno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fda5851b1f3c016396b979","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608691,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephen James-Yeoman","original_name":"Stephen James-Yeoman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fda5b91b1f3c017c979736","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7j62289Yr41l6Aty6W0epqIgIzW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1768,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gMMFetvRxLbqBvJRO2QqvRpRJVs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1179}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2023-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
