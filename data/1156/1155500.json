Witnessed through the eyes of a gifted twelve year old girl, high and low culture clash in the neutral battle field of a museum. Filmed in Super 35 mm, Stereomongrel style can be described as \"hyper, supra, and marvelous real,\" through the use of 3-D animation, stop-motion animation, and highly choreographed tableaux or set pieces. Genres that are blended and tweaked by this uniquely hybridized film include psychological/supernatural thrillers, Italian horror movies from the 70s and 80s, and the unattainable ideals - both physical and economic - found in hip-hop music videos and fashion magazines.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/g0FGpcwb4d8q7kEDlMOYugfSIqX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stereomongrel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matisse Clayton","original_name":"Matisse Clayton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hortencia","credit_id":"64bd7ef9ad50f000e4c7738f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ein Tan","original_name":"Ein Tan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Curator 2","credit_id":"64bd8117ac6c7908dd1d2026","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrique Miron","original_name":"Enrique Miron","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Guard","credit_id":"64bd8139eb79c2011c25a2dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cookie Hensley","original_name":"Cookie Hensley","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Blasterette 2","credit_id":"64bd8162ac6c7908e0869bc4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Lucas","original_name":"Erika Lucas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Blasterette 4","credit_id":"64bd817a85c0a200ad609963","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1740087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cindy Johnson","original_name":"Cindy Johnson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Curator 1","credit_id":"64bd819ce9da69014fec1672","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey James Reed","original_name":"Jeffrey James Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd7ea258efd300ace22b0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3977484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Gispert","original_name":"Luis Gispert","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":"/A5BhwgsGNuxgmtGpGQiratSPSBc.jpg","credit_id":"64bd7e8fac6c7908de5fa547","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3977484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Gispert","original_name":"Luis Gispert","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":"/A5BhwgsGNuxgmtGpGQiratSPSBc.jpg","credit_id":"64bd7ebcad50f0013b127222","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0810460","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g0FGpcwb4d8q7kEDlMOYugfSIqX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stereomongrel (Short Film)","key":"134376948","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-07-24T04:15:31.000Z","id":"64bd7f19eb79c2011c25a24e"}]}}}
