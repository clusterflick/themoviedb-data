It was to be a special event, a mystery show. The venue, at first a secret location was, in fact, the Victorian concert hall at the Pavilion Gardens in Buxton, a quiet spa town in Derbyshire’s picturesque Peak District.  “Shine So Hard” documents the event, what Ian Pye of the Melody Maker described as ‘A Coppola inspired vision of Armageddon’. The film was released on the 13th of August 1981. It was premiered at London’s ICA and screened for two weeks there and elsewhere in the UK.
