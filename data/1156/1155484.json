In 1993, when salons, barbershops, schools, and churches were closing their doors to the LGBTQ+ community for fear of “catching” AIDS, this church not only welcomed the community into the church but affixed two large red ribbons of love to the sides of its tower to proclaim that all are welcome.","popularity":0.4224,"poster_path":"/fIDO4jDPKWzKjwdDm0TBPsH2JJA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red
