In 1946, climbers trained at the Fontainebleau Climbing School. Guy Poulet and Jacques Poincenot try to climb the Aiguilles de Chamonix but fail during the climbing phase. After a night in a refuge with Denise Rouzeau and the guide Pierre Allain, the mountaineers make a new attempt. Successful demonstration for those who continued the approach walk then the passage of the seracs of the glacier. On the rock, the roped party crosses a chimney and a crack to reach the summit and abseil down. Led by high mountain scouts, Guy and Jacques rediscover the glaciers and needles of the Mont-Blanc massif during the next lesson.","popularity":0.5738,"poster_path":"/uzTK2w9kZ5YOvXa9vV1okCaL1sn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196912,"logo_path":"/nRtogyDc0ZaW7SHNxlXe0ZJO92l.png","name":"Club Alpin Français (CAF)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":204639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bloc-Notes Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Call Of The Peaks","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Allain","original_name":"Pierre Allain","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/nCtdCEV0PTdXKNhsZUlbvTFR1wl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bc769958efd3013953617e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4162581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Poulet","original_name":"Guy Poulet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pI1stWLrttRXX5km4qVhtzFHyZc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bc7737ac617c01202d04cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4175753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Poincenot","original_name":"Jacques Poincenot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2OaUN3EWp6rWxPqv60Me8EQ8INE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bc775f85c0a200c897d52e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4175751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Rouzeau","original_name":"Denise Rouzeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bc76b158efd300ace1ac1b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3662891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yves Ballu","original_name":"Yves Ballu","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/i3o1Kow1OLYgA1GJHSmoAGo7ofh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bc7741af85de00c662ae9a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1460967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Francœur","original_name":"Richard Francœur","popularity":0.2597,"profile_path":"/4GOo11Pt7GhcC7pbT09V13jJNgm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64bc7dbcac6c7908dd1cab31","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4175757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Fuller","original_name":"Jacques Fuller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bc7f10ac6c7908dd1cac09","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827798,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrée Laurent","original_name":"Andrée Laurent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bc7ec858efd300c5fe6877","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3683246,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Georges Tairraz II","original_name":"Georges Tairraz II","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iy598sa3blmE2v5jUYDSUXIzi3p.jpg","credit_id":"64bc7ea3ac6c7908de5f29ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Pol","original_name":"Alain Pol","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bc7143ac6c7908db5b62cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1675428,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcel Gilot","original_name":"Marcel Gilot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bc7edbac617c0103e1dcf9","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7812434","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v8zjryCgDvVm61BZI32E5Jn5jS6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzTK2w9kZ5YOvXa9vV1okCaL1sn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1262,"name":"mountain"},{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":210514,"name":"fontainebleau"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":266669,"name":"alpes"},{"id":272233,"name":"escalade"},{"id":307663,"name":"mountain pioneer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"L'Appel Des Cimes (1946) directed by  Alain Pol","key":"ZvE4dpnQZko","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-24T09:09:53.000Z","id":"64bc6ff9eb79c200e28d2c07"}]}}}
