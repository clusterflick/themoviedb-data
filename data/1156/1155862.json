Landscape of a city is slowly melting into sand dunes. Buildings become mountains, the land becomes vast and the eyes can rest on the distant line of horizon. The desert is an oasis for contemplation. When your eyes are sharp enough you can see far beyond – you can see stars, planets, you can see other worlds. Inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni “Zabriskie point” and Philipp Garrel “The inner Scar,” “Walking in the Time of Uncertainty” tells the story of an explorer who leaves the city in search of a bigger world. Oliver Ousterhout, DP, turns this journey into expansive meditation on time and space and Max Mollring, colorist, makes every scene into a dream-like painting.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking in the Time of Uncertainty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Kechaeva","original_name":"Masha Kechaeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64beb3c5b865eb00e20789dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6b48gD0W90jRb538HS7D9UDmhxj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ymGjOuqloK5cpUeL0GECjry0xvN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Roxie Theater, San Francisco","release_date":"2023-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
