Within two years, it had been seen in Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, Prague, Berlin, Manchester and beyond. With over 500 performances chalked up at Covent Garden alone, this opera is one of the most popular and enduring in the repertoire.  In this performance from 2020, Sonya Yoncheva stars as the doomed seamstress Mimì, with Charles Castronovo as Rodolfo, who falls in love with her at first sight. Simona Mihai and Andrzej Filonczyk perform the roles of the on-off lovers, Musetta and Marcello.  Poverty and passion collide in a story of friendship and fellowship, love and loss. Featuring some of Puccini’s best-loved music, this performance is conducted by Emmanuel Villaume.","popularity":0.1932,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Bohème from the Royal Opera House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946981,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzy Klein","original_name":"Suzy Klein","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"presenter","credit_id":"64bd7aeab865eb01399cc105","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1683797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Yoncheva","original_name":"Sonya Yoncheva","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/7KgfzEZluTl9HIQBqwHaew4WJRA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mimì","credit_id":"64bd7b010ed2ab011ca83c0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Castronovo","original_name":"Charles Castronovo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/kH3RqNqHPkwywWxysQLxw2Y3Vsb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rodolfo","credit_id":"64bd7b100ed2ab00ff8710e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simona Mihai","original_name":"Simona Mihai","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Musetta","credit_id":"64bd7b23ac6c7908dd1d1eb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2381371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrzej Filończyk","original_name":"Andrzej Filończyk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marcello","credit_id":"64bd7b47e9da69012e0e6a82","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3089537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Kellner","original_name":"Peter Kellner","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Colline","credit_id":"64bd7c06e9da69010d40ffd6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyula Nagy","original_name":"Gyula Nagy","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Schaunard","credit_id":"64bd7c2358efd3013953f148","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Jones","original_name":"Peter Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd7c6eeb79c200e28db683","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Hasswell","original_name":"Jonathan Hasswell","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd7c90eb79c200e28db699","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629624,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emmanuel Villaume","original_name":"Emmanuel Villaume","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd7ca0b865eb00ff4d305d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2021-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
