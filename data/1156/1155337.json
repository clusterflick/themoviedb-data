Because of her strictness the villagers call Anzirat \"Grandma-General\".  Back in the 1930s, Anzirat headed the main farm of the village and went through many hardships. Even when she gets old, Anzirat does not want to rest and cannot put up with the laziness, greed, and negligence of some of the villagers. She tries to put things in order for her family. Her son, however, instead of helping his pregnant wife spends all his spare time building a family football team. Only after Anzirat's death do the residents of the village realize how empty their village is without her. They feel that Anzirat was the conscience of their village.","popularity":0.2502,"poster_path":"/acObNe9EoiWztTj000wpi1hyp9C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189675,"logo_path":"/dcpUQhz4nFOiFFHEcr1TuhlznLM.png","name":"Uzbekfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Uzbek","iso_639_1":"uz","name":"ozbek"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandma the General","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Babushka-General","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gani Agzamov","original_name":"Гани Агзамов","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/tLce7k9tNyV9bnLydKr1PQNC2xb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd116be9da6900af7115fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1772165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Kosubayeva","original_name":"Тамара Косыбаева","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/yjX26HA8vwBwAeKGSR3979wfUXj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd117158efd300e2f1f158","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4176174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zainab Sadriyeva","original_name":"Zainab Sadriyeva","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd117785c0a20144075b7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nailya Tashkenbayeva","original_name":"Nailya Tashkenbayeva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd118158efd3013953c8ce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nurmukhan Zhanturin","original_name":"Нрмхан Жантрин","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/4LNXUdf9de5wSkU6uxRgBNQSlqy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd119085c0a201254fb69e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2375177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abduraim Abduvahobov","original_name":"Abduraim Abduvahobov","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"677f091389fc5d94424e82e1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melis Abzalov","original_name":"Melis Abzalov","popularity":0.1541,"profile_path":"/nV0qSFpibVhpSx0LfKFZm3jrb3x.jpg","credit_id":"64bd1159eb79c200c5da1f2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2807620","wikidata_id":"Q3999955","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1391,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acObNe9EoiWztTj000wpi1hyp9C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
