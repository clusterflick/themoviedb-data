A collective of queer athletes enters the Olympic Stadium in Athens and sets out to honour those who were excluded from standing on the winners’ podium. They meet Amanda Reiter, a trans* marathon runner who has to struggle with the prejudices of sports organisers, and Annet Negesa, a 800m runner who was urged by the international sports federations to undergo hormone-altering surgery. Together they create a radical poetic utopia far from the rigid gender rules found in competitive sports.","popularity":0.6008,"poster_path":"/6w4fb7X0IOET2Nn0D63Xm90QgiJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178390,"logo_path":"/aFowNePzfAPXFkx2mcdXiPIIswv.png","name":"Schuldenberg
