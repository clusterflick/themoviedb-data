The film starts with an historical summary illustrating the aspirations and methods that lead man to conquer the mountains. Armand Charlet teaches mountaineering techniques and takes his students to the field for glacier or rock exercises. Gaston Rebuffat makes demonstrations of particularly dangerous climbs. At altitude, people move in solitude, cold and silence, like circus acrobats without spectators, but nothing stops the modern mountaineer.","popularity":0.2441,"poster_path":"/pbZGHvMxhyfuqCvjVxbAwc3y3WP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1184,"logo_path":"/zO9b7GDE5lWRINx94WBu8EB9Gry.png","name":"Procinex","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Des
