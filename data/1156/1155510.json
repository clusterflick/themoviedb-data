Set in the rural Ozark Mountains, \"Jori\" tells the story of a teen girl shackled by an enormous burden. For nineteen-year-old Jori Thomas, each day starts at sunrise, as she treks into the forest to hunt the coyote that killed her beloved family cat. The moment she returns home, consistently unsuccessful, Jori resumes the role of caring for her father, mute and nearly unresponsive. Jori's obligation to her father is one of love and duty, but the days she spends in isolation leave her a stranger to her own needs. Her one solace is in her lover, Eve, who occasionally coaxes her back to the woods for a night of freedom. As her father's condition worsens and struggles arise to secure his life-saving medication, Jori becomes more and more detached. Jori is faced with a choice - save everyone else, or save herself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bjKXAt9Jxww93XIFBcb8DkuDjS3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nurture's not her nature.","title":"Jori","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4176719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloe Jewell","original_name":"Chloe Jewell","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/g89iSnuIgklw1Jya7JP93gis1KA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jori","credit_id":"64bd8a4bc390c5013c533491","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Del Rossi","original_name":"Molly Del Rossi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eve","credit_id":"64bd8a55c390c5011f711e9e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Nelson","original_name":"Tyler Nelson","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"64bd8a84b865eb00ff4d339f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris LaFever","original_name":"Chris LaFever","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cal","credit_id":"64bd8a9158efd3013953f547","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hunter Adams","original_name":"Hunter Adams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd8aa985c0a201254fe0cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hunter Adams","original_name":"Hunter Adams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd8ab5e9da69010d41039b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hunter Adams","original_name":"Hunter Adams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd8ac8c390c500c80a8873","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176733,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dylan Thomas","original_name":"Dylan Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd8affad50f000e4c77621","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bjKXAt9Jxww93XIFBcb8DkuDjS3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1383}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
