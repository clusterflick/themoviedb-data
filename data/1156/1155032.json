Yet this profile piece for the COI cinemagazine series “This Week in Britain” offers glimpses that his high life had both its ups and downs. A record-breaking jump of 24 cars was to be the big attraction of a May bank holiday at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu but torrential rain scuppered plans. Kidd returned on the 4th June for a second attempt but with a shoulder injury that you see aggravated here, which prevented a planned second jump and again disappointed audiences. The person tasked with turning all these travails into a light-hearted snippet for overseas audiences was Peter Greenaway, who edited hundreds of stories like this before making arthouse feature hits such as The Draughtman’s Contract (1982).","popularity":0.3178,"poster_path":"/8FVKSmPW1Vw03W6RCBBQLPUvccC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eddie Kidd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Palmer","original_name":"Maggie Palmer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self – Host","credit_id":"67f976e9d3ab7d7a8badb769","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":555123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Kidd","original_name":"Eddie Kidd","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bbe0ac85c0a200ad5fe05a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4264269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammy Miller","original_name":"Sammy Miller","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f9771eea80d8517599c21d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Greenaway","original_name":"Peter Greenaway","popularity":0.3017,"profile_path":"/xw8UM4GStDbmNy21Hi1tI1UprgW.jpg","credit_id":"64bbe0cbe9da6900cb7b9205","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Greenaway","original_name":"Peter Greenaway","popularity":0.3017,"profile_path":"/xw8UM4GStDbmNy21Hi1tI1UprgW.jpg","credit_id":"64bbe0bd58efd30139532156","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0270328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8FVKSmPW1Vw03W6RCBBQLPUvccC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
