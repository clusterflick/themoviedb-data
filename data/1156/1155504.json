In November 2002, the Stones arrived in Los Angeles to perform at a packed Wiltern Theatre, treating fans to a set heavy on rarities which feel right at home in such an intimate setting. While some of the hits are performed, this night at the Wiltern is for the rarely played classics, including Stray Cat Blues, No Expectations and a cover of Everybody Needs Somebody to Love featuring a guest spot by the legendary Solomon Burke.","popularity":1.2395,"poster_path":"/eXf0pbHLqrEpYJcMTbawoFEibJi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152305,"logo_path":"/aWXC584uLR18zZQZHsuqJnodwSg.png","name":"Mercury Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rolling Stones - Live at the Wiltern","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Rolling Stones：Live At The Wiltern Theatre","type":"Full Title with alt char '：' for Windows filenames"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jagger","original_name":"Mick Jagger","popularity":0.6912,"profile_path":"/r1uFIYnBCDhIlqNbiTS4nDrjHrl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bd843de9da69010d4101f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Richards","original_name":"Keith Richards","popularity":0.7344,"profile_path":"/t1oa5UsJMmrhNqCIks4jQnAYSQT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bd844ab865eb00c5882f4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Wood","original_name":"Ronnie Wood","popularity":0.3169,"profile_path":"/x9cPzzqEOLIuvwsqfqoDTdXeeny.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bd8461eb79c200e28db890","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Watts","original_name":"Charlie Watts","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/yZUiyOV9ImKLwAczuLd7TsImC1k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bd848685c0a200c8985cd8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marty Callner","original_name":"Marty Callner","popularity":0.1856,"profile_path":"/sejIEdA4ucYxUpfL9HxIzEM7fnq.jpg","credit_id":"65ef3db008cf870162d5c389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claire Rhodes","original_name":"Claire Rhodes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd849aac6c7908dd1d20fc","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277487,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kyle Smart","original_name":"Kyle Smart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd84a785c0a201254fdf5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3083951,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alice Webb","original_name":"Alice Webb","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd84d3eb79c200ff9d6509","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711003,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lindsay Brown","original_name":"Lindsay Brown","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd84e4c390c500c80a8707","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549411,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosie Holley","original_name":"Rosie Holley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bd84c358efd300ace22c7b","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AfIUBoSHtRedhWut6yzf46IPYab.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ix0G1vdGIxKqki20uaxKR9HyKd4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eXf0pbHLqrEpYJcMTbawoFEibJi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oRYeIIvZnBzjVJhaFEOhvrGr4Tl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2022-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"UZ9TMq_lX-g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-01-09T15:00:24.000Z","id":"66fb71e0d8064165bdf1693b"}]}}}
