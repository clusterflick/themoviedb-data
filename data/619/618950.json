Therefore, his method was to address the people, explaining the disadvantages of this occupation. Therefore, the Turkish ruler saw that Juha had become one of the rioters against them, so he ordered his dismissal from his work as an imam. Rather, he goes so far as to arrest and imprison him, and after a while orders his release, but he still continues his struggle against injustice and oppression.","popularity":0.2926,"poster_path":"/rBReA4MhAIkgn0JUqZ1Ygqn121Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178095,"logo_path":"/uIWOjECYaXtA8acNh5HK0ANPOGJ.png","name":"United Film Co.
