Globe Trekker's Beirut City Guide captures the city in more optimistic days, two weeks before the latest outbreak of hostilities in Lebanon between Israeli and Hezbollah forces in July 2006. Globe Trekker Megan McCormick explores the neighborhoods of Basta, Solidere, Gemayze and the Hezbollah District and finds a city in the midst of regeneration. She gets a glimpse at Beirut's future when meeting up with a group of young Arabic hip hop artists, who are eager to live in peace and put the country's political troubles in the past.","popularity":0.5601,"poster_path":"/pEd020W77ACZDINqVCXy7wDaRpW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pilot Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2007-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beirut City Guide","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan McCormick","original_name":"Megan McCormick","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/t2cR3pD7v4COb49lE0gghi4d4ja.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d39836d60c51d6c6a825418","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merrilees Parker","original_name":"Merrilees Parker","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d39837860c51d1ed481220a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Wright","original_name":"Ian Wright","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/3kGoNVTMaScWU4l7PtBzUlontgu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d3983f1e54d5d2533db8240","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Allan","original_name":"Dominic Allan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3982abe54d5d09e8da6351","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cross","original_name":"Ian Cross","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3982bb60c51d3bd2811915","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3LoAMMb2r4caXry5wwHKxXuatHF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pEd020W77ACZDINqVCXy7wDaRpW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4674,"name":"sightseeing"},{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":195239,"name":"travelogue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
