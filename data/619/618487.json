His brother, Tom, falls in love with Muriel Beekman, their guardian's daughter. Barry also loves her but feels rejected. Three years later, after extended travels, Barry learns that Tom, having been sent to Morocco by Mr. Beekman, has been captured by desert marauders and is being held for ransom. He begins a search for him and in Tangiers encounters the Beekmans and Kitty Van Ness. Barry and Muriel discover their love for each other, but he refuses to commit himself while Tom is still alive.","popularity":0.4925,"poster_path":"/2NAscGPb0AztW4RcBXUWffKOsdy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All the Exotic Glamour of the East Woven in a Livid Picture of Love","title":"Cheated Hearts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Rawlinson","original_name":"Herbert Rawlinson","popularity":0.2357,"profile_path":"/siWyKk2R5OfDhdJHYtlAPdYuXAc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Barry Gordon","credit_id":"617c9668d236e600433c437d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Baxter","original_name":"Warner Baxter","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/vX605wp5rnjezGUnsTSrFse5tPy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Gordon","credit_id":"617c9676176a940043bc3819","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Daw","original_name":"Marjorie Daw","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/2qRdFO7uZm5UQlh2kdaLGTYb5kO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Muriel Bekkman","credit_id":"617c96850d5d85002afae860","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Pawn","original_name":"Doris Pawn","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/d2d8vvnE5maAAW0tZzmc3LpGTGS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kitty Van Ness","credit_id":"617c96945aba3200439fbf10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winter Hall","original_name":"Winter Hall","popularity":0.1588,"profile_path":"/jDN707Y6PhbruDCGGHkvpuFSTmc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Nathanial Beekman","credit_id":"617c96a4e93e95008e818526","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Swickard","original_name":"Josef Swickard","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/fvkxWMqUjAmbHrBD1a0J2U4PIMO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Colonel Fairfax Gordon","credit_id":"617c96b3d236e6002a872bf7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murdock MacQuarrie","original_name":"Murdock MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/xjXY0di1hFXfnErsfAwkOgBSCjd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ibrahim","credit_id":"617c96c184f249002dcd9ff8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Karloff","original_name":"Boris Karloff","popularity":0.7586,"profile_path":"/fVi0QkiziavXB8HnWk5NzRcnCO1.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Nei Hamid","credit_id":"617c96cf229ae2002a5bc2a7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Lehr","original_name":"Anna Lehr","popularity":0.1998,"profile_path":"/wNAhis8dDACC0Ttq16vjOOS9Bvt.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Naomi","credit_id":"617c96dfcb6db5006225bdf5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert MacQuarrie","original_name":"Albert MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Hassam","credit_id":"617c96eee323f300912c5bfd","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hector V.
