The antennas propagate it throughout the planet and are the dogs the first to hear it. Meanwhile, workers lose their lives working in the factory. The animals escape from their homes and the owners go looking for them. In the streets they hear the voices of past revolutions and wonder if a new world can grow at this moment.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/fBgOeqWYGrOmNq2FbwqkfN7uYre.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Owner's Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Owner's Portrait","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2250386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Mazú","original_name":"Tatiana Mazú","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/w9V62SOkX9bO7BjiyGbtB2zknEd.jpg","credit_id":"64a99b496a3448012ce493a5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2808373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Embalse","original_name":"Manuel Embalse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99b3d6a344800ad756521","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquín Maito","original_name":"Joaquín Maito","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3c234221621b0010ee1d93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9540282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":1008,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fBgOeqWYGrOmNq2FbwqkfN7uYre.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
