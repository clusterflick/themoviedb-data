This peninsula is given to the exclusive use of the monks of Eastern Christianity. Images of nature are woven into a virtually uninterrupted series of work and prayer, lining up in the rhythmic interrelation of man and nature. The central figure of the film was the monastery’s elder, Hegumen Gregory, whose long-term experience of spiritual nourishment rewarded him with a deep understanding of the human soul and her desire to return to the state characteristic of Adam’s human nature before the fall.","popularity":0.6276,"poster_path":"/1g8wdvr128aMyVKBvalvsuoUIVz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where are you, Adam?","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Gde ty, Adam?","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"De Ty, Adame?","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Kur tu esi, Ādam?","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Где си, Адаме?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2370887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","original_name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d39a55460c51d00138af873","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2370887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","original_name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d39a50fe54d5d4654de4cd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2370887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","original_name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d39a55eab684969a586274e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2370887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","original_name":"Alexandr Zaporoshchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d39a559d036b6000f757818","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2370889,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oleksandr Plyska","original_name":"Oleksandr Plyska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d39a56cab684969a5862772","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10097086","wikidata_id":"Q106762854","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"waya_doc_movie","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6UlFvzQ1yd6mutNMILnDe4coHIS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1g8wdvr128aMyVKBvalvsuoUIVz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/yV9yq7MiisaatnwUebqSoJnVTGn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1753,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/6RgDINI07exZbDzUZ1XcrE5iEaF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1169},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/c48oPFvSqzTnfRnPS1iDUBTSxjH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sr","file_path":"/3XnAL9fxm5E1VU0k89QnISNjByZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":439,"name":"paradise"},{"id":6157,"name":"prayer"},{"id":345,"name":"monk"},{"id":4116,"name":"heaven"},{"id":7412,"name":"sin"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":177146,"name":"meaning of life"},{"id":232917,"name":"orthodox christianity"},{"id":262074,"name":"seeking a god"},{"id":323702,"name":"holy mount athos"},{"id":323703,"name":"monastic life"},{"id":323704,"name":"holiness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Where are you, Adam? official trailer","key":"UAeiv2C0hNE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-01T22:02:30.000Z","id":"6361c192be55b7007d18d02a"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Where are you, Adam?
