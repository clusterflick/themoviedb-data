Anna Persico awakes and find a red box near her bed. Inside, just a note with incomprehensible symbols. From that moment, her life totally changes. Few moments later Anna's phone rings: it's a friend asking help. Just few and upset words asking Anna reaching her in a forsaken mansion in the nearby before the phone line breaks. At the same time, on October 15th 1817, police commissioner Fosco Oleari investigates on suicide of Vittoria Clementi, a girl who looks just alike Anna. On the crime scene there are also a cane and a gown soiled of blood. Local doctor's wife is missing from the day before.
