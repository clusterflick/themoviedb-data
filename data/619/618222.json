The filmmaker built a cabin on an isolated riverbank, just opposite his childhood island, which had disappeared under the water after the construction of a dam. The goal was to go back to that place, which had become invisible. Only the trees of the island where he’d played stood firm in the middle of the water, like the masts of a broken toy boat, so the air was the only space left, the only vestige of the past to be conquered. This film is a diary of a castaway in memories: four months of a Walden experience in a lost paradise with two hens, a small vegetable garden and a clock that stopped forever at 11.36 and 23 seconds.","popularity":0.2518,"poster_path":"/9ngDjXOXRP2PJXssbWV9KHYmSiv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emak Bakia Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zumiriki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elías Alegría","original_name":"Elías Alegría","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644fa12d23a31402e57c232d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Alegria","original_name":"Oskar Alegria","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6cb20265686e3c1288c12d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Alegria","original_name":"Oskar Alegria","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6cb22020ecaf000f29d243","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Alegria","original_name":"Oskar Alegria","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6cb21565686e000f897187","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678148,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Haimar Olaskoaga","original_name":"Haimar Olaskoaga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6cb257efcea900119b1c47","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402848,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Justa Mentaberri","original_name":"Justa Mentaberri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6e7d0a00fb6b0012e07712","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ainara LeGardon","original_name":"Ainara LeGardon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6e7cdfa284eb01bf343e40","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mixel Etxekopar","original_name":"Mixel Etxekopar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6e7cf69ae61354d90aedc3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1785184,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Xabier Erkizia","original_name":"Xabier Erkizia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nhfCpsB0OQnewCBb0pWHQXO1Hm2.jpg","credit_id":"5d6e7ce9a284eb4733344924","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402850,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ramon Lazkano","original_name":"Ramon Lazkano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6e7d229ae61354d90aedec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402849,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"María Azcona","original_name":"María Azcona","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6e7d1565686e52e7888a76","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Alegria","original_name":"Oskar Alegria","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4ec27435811d001751a868","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10749710","wikidata_id":"Q130355125","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2517,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/9ngDjXOXRP2PJXssbWV9KHYmSiv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1790},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/taB2256G1vIOXnhKKCcor8K8aCX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":213280,"name":"basque"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spirit Of Fire International Festival Of Cinematographic Debuts","release_date":"2020-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
