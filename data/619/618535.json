The look at things. The sea, the rocks of Sardinia. The paradise of the fantastic spring flowering. The harshness of inhospitable rocks. The tangle of serpentine branches. The millennial olive tree that does not die. The traces of man. Footprints in the sand and abandoned remains of powerful factories. The dark history of mysterious nuraghi. A woman's old body, her cats and the blowfly. The fatigue and intelligence of beetles. The agony of the insect and the tenderness of fresh throbbing breasts. The days that pass in a terrible and fascinating wait.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4vFC9EGzzdsvcZP8kITkrorVs8W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ORA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6663c550dda42fef2d5057ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6663c5589c304a2609d0216e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6663c55f7cbf4c2abd904c94","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4762013,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paola Ratti","original_name":"Paola Ratti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6663c56e4b5ffdf76150576b","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3b199b60c51d1ed484f100","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4vFC9EGzzdsvcZP8kITkrorVs8W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2011-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
