Despite centuries of vigilant opposition from the Christian Church, Voodoo has flourished in Haiti and continues to be one of the strongest elements underlying Haitian culture. This film dispels Hollywood stereotypes and presents Voodoo as a belief system that has been passed down from African ancestor to slave to present day Haitian.  Traveling from the intensely overcrowded streets of Port-au-Prince to the serenity of the Haitian countryside, the viewer comes to see how the Haitian has accepted both the Christian and Voodoo mythology for use in daily life. The highly integrated Haitian culture is truthfully revealed.","popularity":0.0462,"poster_path":"/zPKPuYRpsM47hhf5wkXCabm2K8G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voodoo and the Church in Haiti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Richards","original_name":"Bob Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3c8b4fa1d33200110c97a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372327,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea E.
