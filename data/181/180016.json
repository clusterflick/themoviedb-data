There, the memory of her birth family was nearly obliterated, until recurring dreams led her to investigate her own past, and she discovered that her Korean mother was very much alive. Bravely uniting her biological and adoptive families, Borshay Liem embarks on a heartfelt journey in this acclaimed film that first premiered on POV in 2000. First Person Plural is a poignant essay on family, loss and the reconciling of two identities.","popularity":0.2517,"poster_path":"/trGjqZTTbq3edGBy4S7bsCFenb3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20591,"logo_path":null,"name":"POV","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":151087,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Asian American Telecommunications Association","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A filmmaker’s quest to discover her true identity spans years, continents and families","title":"First Person Plural","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deann Borshay Liem","original_name":"Deann Borshay Liem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6298b0ac99259c00a810b335","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1814359,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sara Chin","original_name":"Sara Chin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6298b107ec0c5800a38aec58","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874669,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vivian Kleiman","original_name":"Vivian Kleiman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6298b0cfd71fb416ca28e64e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1540358,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vivien Hillgrove","original_name":"Vivien Hillgrove","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6298b0dfec0c5800a38aebf3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deann Borshay Liem","original_name":"Deann Borshay Liem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42b2f999d5c3003ab76293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deann Borshay Liem","original_name":"Deann Borshay Liem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42b2f20bb0760032d7c107","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lora Hirschberg","original_name":"Lora Hirschberg","popularity":0.2312,"profile_path":"/8IJl1itNV99LhKg24yeIGHjYaQd.jpg","credit_id":"66d8ed660850835db49d88c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1540358,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vivien Hillgrove","original_name":"Vivien Hillgrove","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d8d331ea33928297d7046","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deann Borshay Liem","original_name":"Deann Borshay Liem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d8dab6e4210780f7938ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0240505","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/trGjqZTTbq3edGBy4S7bsCFenb3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":628}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2393,"name":"adoption"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":3264,"name":"korean war (1950-53)"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":179468,"name":"interracial adoption"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":188733,"name":"adoptee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
