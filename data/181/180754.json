As a result, he finds himself \"trapped\" in lavish surroundings - his luxury jail - and with publisher rejection letters piling high, Homer has convinced himself of his wife's infidelity. Phillips' darkly-comic script follows Homer as he dives into the prickly territories of self-awareness and self pity, in his quest to find the truth about his possibly cheating wife--and himself--all at a Valentine's Day dinner decidedly set for three. A largely dialogue-driven film, A Swingin' Trio is about four things: love, music, betrayal, and one really good dinner.","popularity":0.0733,"poster_path":"/ffOso7rKdgsR1KdJDRXdrhzId1H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Swingin' Trio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Swinging Trio","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Walter","original_name":"Johnny Walter","popularity":0.1382,"profile_path":"/aBKcBup4D1IJMoft4j2OybERf4m.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c519251416c75116c2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1163309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timeca M.
