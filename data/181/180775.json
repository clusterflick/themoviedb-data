An elf drops by, and they offer to share with him. He teaches them (in song) to dunk the donut in the coffee. Later, as they sleep, he brings several other elves back, and they work through the night making shoes in humorous ways. The shoes are a success. Soon, the shoemaker and his wife are quite prosperous. They treat the elves to a feast of donuts and coffee, and the elves treat us to another chorus of \"Dunk! Dunk! Dunk!\".","popularity":0.2414,"poster_path":"/eoQVSSGkmf3ARAfweNr1ZlHssms.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jolly Little Elves","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernice Hansen","original_name":"Bernice Hansen","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/1T1q0UvWl1xO3pmUbUdDIXz6gvZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elf (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"553ce5aa9251416874005607","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932848,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Manuel Moreno","original_name":"Manuel Moreno","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c529251416c75116cef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"56dcc845925141437f000cd8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"56dcc8539251414375000d05","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932848,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Manuel Moreno","original_name":"Manuel Moreno","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc85ec3a36825a300011e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":196264,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Victor McLeod","original_name":"Victor McLeod","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc864c3a368766a000e8c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Dietrich","original_name":"James Dietrich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc86cc3a368764a0010c1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932733,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laverne Harding","original_name":"Laverne Harding","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc88b925141437f000cf2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932735,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Les Kline","original_name":"Les Kline","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc893c3a3687674000e81","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148826,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Fred Kopietz","original_name":"Fred Kopietz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc89b9251414371000d8a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":598929,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bill Mason","original_name":"Bill Mason","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc932925141437f000d2b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932848,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Manuel Moreno","original_name":"Manuel Moreno","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56dcc93f9251414378000dd8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025332","wikidata_id":"Q1702666","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3WTlrurXA4b3PVgSWvlvKweJY7D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eoQVSSGkmf3ARAfweNr1ZlHssms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4SSUlvSPxkafvwD5h0rVGG0Kxyi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
