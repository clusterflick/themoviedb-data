It's the first part of our \"Dostoevsky-L.A\" project, which also will include \"Crime and Punishment, LA\" and \"Idiot, L.A\". The film crosses and re-crosses the thin line that separates tragedy from comedy. It introduces us to the enchanting Linda, whose life is centered around a planned reunion with her former lover Paul. Her plans change in remarkable ways as she encounters an extraordinary cast of characters, including a new lover and a movie producer who is pursued by the Mafia.","popularity":0.233,"poster_path":"/z6Saf1HxOv2syBIVrxJSR6vpOB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shades of Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2662740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla Bergstrom","original_name":"Camilla Bergstrom","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/mLqNEq7ynn2OK007Lftixh5kHLc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Linda","credit_id":"618fe945e93e950042ecad6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3308003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Smith","original_name":"Alexander Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Steven Prescott","credit_id":"618fe95fd55e4d00647ee175","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Paul Stuart","original_name":"Brian Paul Stuart","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"618fe97066a7c30064c1e547","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Bergeron","original_name":"Philippe Bergeron","popularity":0.1574,"profile_path":"/52pIVnJgvOutQlLLpJwyWWKUVIT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gary","credit_id":"618fe983976a23002ca70c5d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3307999,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Bergquist","original_name":"Jeff Bergquist","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618fe933cf62cd002a025b1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3307983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Sumin","original_name":"Vitaly Sumin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618fe90d976a23002ca70bc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3307983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Sumin","original_name":"Vitaly Sumin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618fe917cb6db5002c402df6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","original_name":"Фёдор Достоевский","popularity":0.5795,"profile_path":"/hMm3y5n60KNvLB5F14oCfo8imSK.jpg","credit_id":"618fe920d75bd6002dacb8db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":831,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z6Saf1HxOv2syBIVrxJSR6vpOB8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
