The Mistress of Tears embodies blind greed; seductive yet shabby. She drinks the tears of others because she cannot shed her own. She longs to feel something other than the vast emptiness that lives within her. She is drawn to light desperately needing respite from her dark world. The moonlight sates her momentarily but the hunger returns, as it must.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mistress of Tears","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3307314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Romine","original_name":"Nicole Romine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618f1b6063e6fb00637291cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13949710","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
