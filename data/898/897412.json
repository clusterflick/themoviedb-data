This docudrama combines the fictionalized story of a conservative white TV host (David Whalen) and a liberal black cameraman (Sam Lothard) interviewing the former Allegheny County medical examiner for a TV show with Dr. Wecht’s actual observations on real events. The film uniquely dissects the cases of JonBenet Ramsey, Nicole Brown Simpson, and the Kennedy assassination, among others.  Based on a play by August Wilson protégé Mark Clayton Southers, Cyril offers a timely look at racism in America.","popularity":0.4155,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cyril","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3281532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril H.
