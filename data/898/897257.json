Burroughs. Because [Swanton’s] thinking seems to have some affinity for Gysin's visual art, he has extended the technique of the cut up not in the direction of Anthony Balch (however interesting works like The Cut-Ups and Ghost at n°9 (Paris) might be,) but in the more radical direction of Letterism (Lettrisme) [...] This is a very daring work, and very, very strong.” - R.
