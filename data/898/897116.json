He is noticed by a violinist and a party dignitary. For the musician, the angel is a source of inspiration; for the man of power - a pretext for a cynical political game.\r From the very beginning, the artist used a combined technique, manipulating shots and graphics. The angel and the masked man with a sack on his back appear in other films created by Serafinski. The angelic ideal is tainted by the society and politics, the masked thief passes by unnoticed. The exchange of elites and masking the cynicism of the government with ostentatious religiosity turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":"/l1jFuIkX6hWTABLsOEzZRprcARt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Koncert","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Концерт","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3306406,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roman Błocki","original_name":"Roman Błocki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e2c4b20e6a500918d9df4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marek Serafiński","original_name":"Marek Serafiński","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e29c4e93e95002b4cbad0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3306412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zofia Karska","original_name":"Zofia Karska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e2ce05f2b8d002663f7bc","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hanna Michalewicz","original_name":"Hanna Michalewicz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e2c68e93e95006270af33","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marek Serafiński","original_name":"Marek Serafiński","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e29d45f2b8d008f93475d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3306407,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Grzywacz","original_name":"Jan Grzywacz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e2c8163e6fb00437406b0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marek Serafiński","original_name":"Marek Serafiński","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e2c9dd55e4d0045ba5247","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11003202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l1jFuIkX6hWTABLsOEzZRprcARt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1987-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
