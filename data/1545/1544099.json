Denis’s father dies in an accident, and a year later his mother, Liza, arrives at the Rozhkovs’ demanding the return of her son. The Rozhkovs consider their grandson the last joy in their lives and throw out the daughter-in-law they despise.  Liza is determined to fight for her child. The Rozhkovs realize that sooner or later they will lose the fight for Denis — the court will side with his mother. Their only chance to keep the boy is to marry Liza off to a local man who will never leave the village. But how can they possibly make that happen?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/37M2ierJ6NAhkEw15K6A9FmKLub.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Troublesome Daughter-in-Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuliya Mayboroda","original_name":"Yuliya Mayboroda","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68c06fa4e3333fb0f59c1092","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Zverev","original_name":"Никита Зверев","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/xSnKJ9FXcdRhWMUcVlvKsAKMGO6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68c06fbba72100a4704e6977","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Batalov","original_name":"Сергей Баталов","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/8h03S0ykiZ2xxp0bJDfgveFeZ71.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68c06fcf8840e7976498cb8b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Bystritskiy","original_name":"Сергей Быстрицкий","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/jHzbjNLhjFvRDOZ47hjWyX7mxXI.jpg","credit_id":"68c06f8e840ac1eeea9bd2cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/37M2ierJ6NAhkEw15K6A9FmKLub.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
