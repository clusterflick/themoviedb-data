It also reflects the vitality, hypocrisy, and sensationalism of our society and the media that feeds it. The film features numerous original interviews with Knef, excerpts from feature films, concert recordings that testify to her stage presence, which is still incredible today, as well as TV reports from Berlin, New York, and elsewhere. In addition to her, friends and relatives, contemporary witnesses, colleagues, and journalists also have their say.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"So oder so ist das Leben – Hildegard Knef","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hildegard Knef","original_name":"Hildegard Knef","popularity":0.3761,"profile_path":"/8FRpERkmYVk3p1UyI1l6zsuCel4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68c042318470119c921f668a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Schäfer","original_name":"André Schäfer","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c042221db6f1cff898c647","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Schäfer","original_name":"André Schäfer","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c04227f2a67aba9e4e6979","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfest Hamburg","release_date":"2025-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
