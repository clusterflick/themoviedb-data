To place two autonomous yet tonally connected genres beside each other (here moving image and audio) produces a space that holds an unpredictable potentiality.  There is a starting state which is simple but soon becomes complex within the observation of the attentive viewer.  This space tends to initiate a generative state of being rather than the falling into an act of recognition. It allows for the palpable experience of murmur which weaves possibility back into the viewers world. Sometimes this can be called sensate thinking for oneself.” - Artist's statement","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philosophy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5682860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Pieters","original_name":"Kim Pieters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c23c8a10647f072c1bdac0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJSDlNPu7XgqTwq0m8kWvd09DBj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
