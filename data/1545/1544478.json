Since their founding, the band has portrayed themselves as a warrior collective from times long past, bringing their tales of crusaders, Vikings, and legends to musical life. Their current album, \"Armageddon,\" is a storm of thunderous riffs, anthemic choruses, and dramatic theatricality, always accompanied by the mystical voice of Morgana le Fay. Those who appreciate monumental hooks, fierce pathos, and a touch of fantasy will find Warkings a show that oscillates between headbanging ecstasy and battlefield atmosphere, loud, proud, and with swords raised.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the realms of Valhalla","title":"WarKings: Live at Wacken Open Air","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Neuhauser","original_name":"Georg Neuhauser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Tribune / Vocals","credit_id":"68c191bc0459e37f171bdb53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Pohl","original_name":"Markus Pohl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Crusader / Guitars","credit_id":"68c1925aad9314daf68cfe15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Rodens","original_name":"Christian Rodens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Viking / Bass","credit_id":"68c1927474c5e036819c21d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffen Theurer","original_name":"Steffen Theurer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Spartan / Drums","credit_id":"68c1928f9d4617380e98ce36","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Secil Sen","original_name":"Secil Sen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Morgana Le Fay / Vocals","credit_id":"68c192ab450c5c74fd1bd71f","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
