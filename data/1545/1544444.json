Or whether she believed your excuses? Or what she wanted to say to the Year 8 boy who refused to leave the class? Well, you’re going to want to see this show. Before Bron Lewis was one of Australia’s most promising new comedians, she was a high school teacher for almost a decade. It was an era where she both nurtured young hearts and encouraged kids to be brilliant, but also made some lifelong enemies. You’ll hear more about them this show than the nerds.  Bron became a teacher because she hates learning – she would rather saw off her own legs then learn a new card game, and in her opinion whoever coined the term ‘board game’ was bang on. Bron raises the question: what happens when someone tries to avoid learning at all costs? They teach. Sit down and get ready to learn.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vZ60PHMzb8yGzO9ybWbCDlsKjpv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Get ready to be glad you're not a teacher","title":"Bron Lewis - Who's Talking?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4135086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bron Lewis","original_name":"Bron Lewis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68c180e6835743b3c706af5d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439397,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Evan Munro-Smith","original_name":"Evan Munro-Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c18131344b8fee0d98d476","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZ60PHMzb8yGzO9ybWbCDlsKjpv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
