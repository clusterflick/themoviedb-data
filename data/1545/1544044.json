Anton is trying to start a new life: an apprenticeship, his own garden shed with his girlfriend, a little happiness without drugs and crime. But then Anton receives a yellow letter. He is accused of \"serious breach of the peace\" and \"resisting law enforcement officers.\" The incident happened two years ago. The images come flooding back: the May Day demonstration, his arrest. Anton has to return to the life he wanted to leave behind. He, a naive, good-natured boy, feels burning hatred when he realizes that he is not the perpetrator, but the victim.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Polizei","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Buket Alakuş","original_name":"Buket Alakuş","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c0506e4604258c058cf815","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13734,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laila Stieler","original_name":"Laila Stieler","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":"/ze3hC42mlviN5e2NM88TDzTeUE8.jpg","credit_id":"68c050755c1e4967ea06ac70","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfest Hamburg","release_date":"2025-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
