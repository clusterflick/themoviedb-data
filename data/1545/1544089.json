She grew up without her mother, and later lost her father as well. Forced to live with a cruel stepmother and stepsister, Nadya nevertheless cherished the memory of her father and longed to fulfill their shared dream.  One day, a wealthy businessman arrives at the hotel where Nadya works as a maid. But would a rich and successful young man ever notice a modest maid? A little miracle — or a few unlikely coincidences — might just make it possible. Yet even more magical twists of fate will be needed for Nadya to attend the ball… or rather, the mayor’s reception.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/l2ZGt7NmJXrQctLq9j52gjUzGf0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hotel for Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2132572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olesya Fattakhova","original_name":"Олеся Фаттахова","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/ooEAQRVcPC2J7Xj7VB44bcPemsv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68c068a29d4617380e98c9db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2113044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruslan Chernetskiy","original_name":"Руслан Чернецкий","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/sbrrJsSxZsjrH4PKo1oncDcDMfr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68c068cab5e9c25e5798c62c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5680275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"evgeniya kulbachnaya","original_name":"evgeniya kulbachnaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68c069051cc83836311bd4a2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2799106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sergey Girgel","original_name":"Sergey Girgel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c06977122c836fc74e6b28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/l2ZGt7NmJXrQctLq9j52gjUzGf0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
