She brings together an unlikely mix of actors, dancers, musicians and local townspeople to recreate scenes of life in the vibrant Jewish town of Ivye before World War II. This film looks with warmth and humor at the ability of people to transcend differences in language, religion and culture to retell a story that had been kept secret for over 50 years.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer in Ivye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5682241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamar Rogoff","original_name":"Tamar Rogoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c1c994840ac1eeea9bd92e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisy Wright","original_name":"Daisy Wright","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c1c9c63bf2b908bf8d01ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0369997","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
