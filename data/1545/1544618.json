In doing so they dispelled the myths that people were powerless to resist the Nazis. DESPERATE HOURS tells the stories of those precious few, who in the face of utter darkness never lost their sight. This film recounts the little known story of Turkey and the Holocaust.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Desperate Hours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5682229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Barrett","original_name":"Victoria Barrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c1c5fba04c22fb979488ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2164398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
