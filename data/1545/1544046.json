This makes him the perfect \"branch\" for the whole building. Stacks of boxes and parcels from his neighbors pile up in his tiny apartment. But one day, love comes knocking at his door: Dörte, the new parcel delivery woman. The grumpy but kind-hearted Prange is smitten, and Dörte doesn't seem averse to the idea either. However, Horst Rohde, Prange's number one annoying neighbor, doesn't like the budding romance at all. Because he has his eye on Dörte himself.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Prange - Man ist ja Nachbar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Jessen","original_name":"Lars Jessen","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/4CiHNslweVmYZ8nIjU5jWqAY4Nb.jpg","credit_id":"68c05127b4b3bbb73b9bcdab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1933669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Altenburg","original_name":"Andreas Altenburg","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c0512f7adab25efd9bd2f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfest Hamburg","release_date":"2025-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
