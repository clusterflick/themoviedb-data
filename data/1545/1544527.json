Connected to the sea and what it provides them, they fought hard to claim decent living conditions. It was with this desire for change that the Culatra Island Residents' Association was created in 1987, which, through electoral boycotts, brought electricity to the island. Director Amílcar Lyra made \"Areia, Lodo e Mar\" (1977), a film in which we see a precarious and isolated Culatra. At one point, we hear a fisherman make a request: that Culatra deserved to be treated better, that it needed electricity, sanitation, shelter for boats. Almost 50 years later, this fisherman is Vítor. Today, he reflects on the evolution of Culatra alongside Rui, a founding member of the Residents' Association, and Madalena. Through their eyes, we follow a year of experiences on the island and discover what really unites this community.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/qXIHoPkdoYLoVdozmL2O7sxYh1L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":273473,"logo_path":"/x5WZBlRDnMfnwlD5zIF1pi6QKRU.png","name":"ESMAD","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out There, Close to the End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vítor Rangel","original_name":"Vítor Rangel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68c1a7b9b657aeb10a1f6593","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rui Conceição","original_name":"Rui Conceição","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68c1a7c8adad6c15461f61a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madalena Conceição","original_name":"Madalena Conceição","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68c1a7f2575a1efdb59bd422","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rui Inácio","original_name":"Rui Inácio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c1a813b4b474000c1f6366","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9oQ43ZWamtSJjYrIqAjxdJchaa5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXIHoPkdoYLoVdozmL2O7sxYh1L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
