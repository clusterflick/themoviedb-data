Driven by Jennifer Haben's powerful voice, they combine orchestral elegance with hard riffing and anthemic choruses that immediately catch the ear. Their songs speak of inner strength, longing, and the power to continually reinvent themselves. Live, they radiate an energy that inspires both dancing and dreaming—a perfect blend of metal thunderstorm and magical storytelling. Beyond the Black prove that big emotions and grand gestures still have a place in metal today.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond The Black Live at Wacken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2305955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Haben","original_name":"Jennifer Haben","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/9CNOn1vcV3X01CPPMDnGuP534p1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"68c1a58de5b0c6eb7d948d81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Hermsdörfer","original_name":"Chris Hermsdörfer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lead Guitar / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"68c1a5b8e3d9f6469098d2a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobi Lodes","original_name":"Tobi Lodes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rhythm Guitar / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"68c1a5d938ae4bfab51f6312","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Tschierschky","original_name":"Kai Tschierschky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"68c1a5f98d71c7c8b68cfc94","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Lop0kpUlv0bE5svbHRKcrDfKtL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
