Then came the live performance, and then the film. The yellow wagtail, Eurasian skylark, white-backed woodpecker, corncrake and hazel grouse have not only gotten their voices back, but have taken on human form — clad in elegant tailcoats and bearing names — to recount ancient tales. Through the interplay of theatrical metamorphoses and the creative team’s reflections on nature and relationships, a field of meaning unfolds, vaster than any single spectator. Where ends the self, and where begin the wings of birds and the branches of trees? Can culture, standing on the shoulders of nature, also nurture it? Or will it merely glisten in the light like a sawblade?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"All Birds Sing Beautifully","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Burāne","original_name":"Krista Burāne","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/2Nw1VgLZSlr166hpzSpG9b8eUC2.jpg","credit_id":"68c1ce8dad9314daf68cff1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Burāne","original_name":"Krista Burāne","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/2Nw1VgLZSlr166hpzSpG9b8eUC2.jpg","credit_id":"68c1cec30e912a38e606b0fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
