Amid Torrance’s dense urban sprawl, the film observes the marsh as an unlikely oasis—home to birds, fish, insects, reptiles, and moments of quiet human presence. Influenced by the rhythms of slow cinema’s great masters, Devereaux shapes stillness and habitat into a meditative portrait of fragile ecology and the persistence of life within an urban environment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/46xJFq6I7xnG71kR8wV0iVQK4ui.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madrona Marsh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68c043176ebe98c71e4e67de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6R0c1InfZOBIdcuwKCP25ipSyjh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/46xJFq6I7xnG71kR8wV0iVQK4ui.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10616,"name":"urban"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":162775,"name":"marsh"},{"id":228988,"name":"slow cinema"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":308818,"name":"avant garde"},{"id":331712,"name":"wetland"},{"id":355880,"name":"los angeles"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lItGwp0PJe0","release_date":"2023-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Madrona Marsh (2023) Max Devereaux Short Film","key":"lItGwp0PJe0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-02T05:13:46.000Z","id":"68c042ddfcc5260ee09c0ee3"}]}}}
