Joined by Alea (Saltatio Mortis) for \"Diggy Diggy Hole\".  The Italian power metallers stand out with their Tolkien-inspired lyrics and monumental melodies â€“ they sound as if they'd set the mountains themselves to music. With their viral earworm \"Diggy Diggy Hole\" and anthemic albums like \"Trollslayer,\" they've enriched the genre with a healthy dose of dwarven epic. Live, they transform the stage into a glittering mine full of folk influences and orchestral power. Anyone who sees them quickly realizes: Wind Rose isn't just about music, but about the pure desire for stories, adventures, and the indomitable power of friends who go into battle together.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wind Rose Live at Wacken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409217,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francesco Cavalieri","original_name":"Francesco Cavalieri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"68c1a26204dd0798a506b531","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alea der Bescheidene","original_name":"Alea der Bescheidene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"68c1a2ac3bf2b908bf8d0132","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5681872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Falconcini","original_name":"Claudio Falconcini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Guitars / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"68c1a2d544cde0e5841f6319","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/owXzAwqdstglmWMdI45U8NSrmj7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
