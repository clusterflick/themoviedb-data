The video employs footage shot at two sites in Rome, Italy:  MURMURATIONS (ROME) documents the act of walking through these historical sites as a means of critically reanimating their political and ideological significance today. Additionally, documentation of the intricately morphing formation of starlings in flight—called murmurations— that descend upon Rome in the evening, is presented along with excerpts from a poem by Pier Paolo Pasolini, 'Le Cenere di Gramsci' (1954).  ​Commissioned by CIRCUIT - Artist Film & Video Aotearoa New Zealand with the assistance of Creative New Zealand for the Thick Cinema project curated by Mercedes Vicente","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mumurations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5682675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Di Stefano","original_name":"John Di Stefano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c2189edb5e4e27ae1f37c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tjPICdRkT0pPnnI0WWQt8JEoJOp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
