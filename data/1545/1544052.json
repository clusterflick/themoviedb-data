Florian is blind. But when they meet, a language beyond words and glances emerges—a language of closeness. Their love seems impossible to outsiders, and that is precisely why it is so overwhelming. It is not silence or darkness that stands between them, but the effort to truly understand each other—and the courage to withstand everything again and again. An intense journey full of ups and downs takes its course: two people who live and love with all their senses.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Als wäre es leicht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milan Skrobanek","original_name":"Milan Skrobanek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c052fec7cfcca8619bd05f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milan Skrobanek","original_name":"Milan Skrobanek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c05303934c154ceb8cfa91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1986157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eibe Maleen Krebs","original_name":"Eibe Maleen Krebs","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c0530b4232fbfcd74e66b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfest Hamburg","release_date":"2025-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
