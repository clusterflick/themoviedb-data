A policeman interferes and is put to sleep when Jerry falls on him. Jerry appropriates his clothes and enters his girl's home, arrests her father, who has been peppering him with a gun, and has him sent to the police station. Jerry gets his autoped and starts with the daughter for a ride. In the country they are discovered by Bad Bill and his outlaws. They take Jerry and the girl to a cabin where a fight ensues as to who shall have possession of the girl. It is finally decided that the bandits shall draw cards. Jerry objects and is locked in the attic. He escapes by climbing down the wall. Entering the cabin, he crawls along the floor, frisks the bandits' guns from their holsters and makes the bandits back against the door. Meanwhile the policeman has recovered consciousness and with his brother officers starts on Jerry's trail. They arrive at the cabin as Jerry is about to flee.","popularity":0.1653,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cub Comedies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerry and the Outlaws","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ovey","original_name":"George Ovey","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/6is2ebdbjrQzsoksjFyUWZcijJL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jerry","credit_id":"5bbc7d79c3a36858f201509c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2145795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George George","original_name":"George George","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bill Outlaw","credit_id":"5bbc7d900e0a26660c01311c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.J.
