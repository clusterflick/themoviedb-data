The ring of hammer in our hero's blacksmith shop is silent. The melody of a hymn steals out of the village church. The village belle is flirting with the simple-hearted smith. It is Monday, and the village belle is plunged in sorrow. Hiram Hardheart demands her hand in marriage. He will foreclose the mortgage. Enter the smith. Exit the villain. Fate opens the way to pay off the mortgage. The smith challenges One Punch Murph. They fight for a purse of $1,000.
