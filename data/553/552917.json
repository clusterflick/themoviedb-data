The family enjoyed rapid success, and their bakery in Jaffa soon became a well-known establishment, drawing crowds from all over the country. This led to the first franchised food chain in Israel – Sammy Bourekas & Sons. Run by patriarch Sammy’s two sons and son-in-law, bakeries selling bourekas popped up all over Israel. Money started to flow, accompanied by an extravagant lifestyle and parties with Israeli high-society: politicians, soccer players, actors and models. But as the rival siblings began to clash, jealousy, honour and greed threatened to tear down the family empire.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":"/lgwnxZPWEylvASPwwZjMR4NDk42.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The King of Börek","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2145813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orit Ofir Ronell","original_name":"Orit Ofir Ronell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbc8037c3a368590d014c54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9061918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lgwnxZPWEylvASPwwZjMR4NDk42.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":695}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocAviv Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
