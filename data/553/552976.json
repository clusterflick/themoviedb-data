Valery Gergiev’s idiomatic and authoritative conducting inspires a superb cast, headed by Plácido Domingo (Ghermann), breathtaking in his portrayal of a man unraveling toward suicide. Galina Gorchakova is Lisa, the woman he loves and destroys, Dmitri Hvorostovsky lends a superb voice and regal bearing to Prince Yeletsky; and Elisabeth Söderström is hair-raising as the old Countess. Olga Borodina is Paulina and Nikolai Putilin is Count Tomsky.","popularity":0.2813,"poster_path":"/8OgzlkgMMYeziixvcmgnJVvvUNe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen of Spades [The Metropolitan Opera]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Galina Gorchakova","original_name":"Galina Gorchakova","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"5bbcba74925141378b017158","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitri Hvorostovsky","original_name":"Dmitri Hvorostovsky","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/wsveOOlInF6SejnN6wWWoDORPBp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Prince Yeletsky","credit_id":"5bbcba7dc3a3685901016963","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plácido Domingo","original_name":"Plácido Domingo","popularity":0.342,"profile_path":"/r0OUJ630b7dllOFBQ4SElP3XnpC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gherman","credit_id":"5bbcba87c3a36858f001a9d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1150065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Söderström","original_name":"Elisabeth Söderström","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/9JeW49ZNFMVTFnPDqTkzkUO57CX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Countess","credit_id":"5bbcba970e0a26661e019e52","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Putilin","original_name":"Nikolai Putilin","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Count Tomsky","credit_id":"5bbcba9f0e0a266615019651","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Пётр Чайковский","popularity":0.3088,"profile_path":"/zTnrtuLddN6KYU3gVVepEiAsgek.jpg","credit_id":"64fc51fcefea7a00aad57b03","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc5212ffc9de0ee3c3fce3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Modest Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Modest Tchaikovsky","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc5228f8595800c59b100d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4262272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elijah Moshinsky","original_name":"Elijah Moshinsky","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc523affc9de0edf5ee187","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4262273,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valery Gergiev","original_name":"Valery Gergiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc524bdb4ed610363d3322","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0302957","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OgzlkgMMYeziixvcmgnJVvvUNe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1029,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qpnCVKL3GHIKCjIdlaORclcbECA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
