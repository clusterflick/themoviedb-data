Although yet a young man, the enemy of his family had already sunk its claws firmly upon James Grant. A man of superior intelligence, his habits hold him down to the lot of a common laborer in a small saw mill on the St. Johns River. About two years before the opening of the picture he had met and fallen in love with Jenny, the daughter of a small farmer, living near the saw mill. Under the influence of her great love he has succeeded in throwing off the burden of his hereditary desires. For three months he has not touched a drop of liquor.","popularity":0.4549,"poster_path":"/7XsOXB0daquwCFVgDtzU1r0ja2i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1909-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Slave to Drink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1056792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Gauntier","original_name":"Gene Gauntier","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/tjbAFbVpKK2V0lvwiIsecoecf7U.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"5bb732380e0a2633a0026aac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.J.
