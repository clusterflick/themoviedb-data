The great James Morris is Claggart, master-at-arms on the 18th-century warship Indomitable, who falsely accuses Billy of inciting a mutiny. Philip Langridge sings Captain Vere, the honest commander who knows that Billy is innocent but finds himself unable to save him. Steuart Bedford, Britten’s close collaborator during the last years of the composer’s life, is on the podium.","popularity":0.1845,"poster_path":"/rV6qSEgehrmDvPSLZsMg130pPa6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy Budd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Langridge","original_name":"Philip Langridge","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/sUTx0uVyfuzXLxhuuhHsxjzDHXE.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Captain Vere","credit_id":"5bbcb732c3a368590a019615","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwayne Croft","original_name":"Dwayne Croft","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/qotUOcABW2A37LmK4VehrVlBESf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Billy Budd","credit_id":"5bbcb7380e0a26660e017f8e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":432628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morris","original_name":"James Morris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1YYYRhX4X1Z8MrRgBa88dpLTm9X.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Claggart","credit_id":"5bbcb744925141379a01808f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Robbins","original_name":"Julien Robbins","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lieutenant Ratcliffe","credit_id":"65148beb1db65d013b447285","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2128294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Dean Griffey","original_name":"Anthony Dean Griffey","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Arthur Jones","credit_id":"65148c04a1074b01008fb543","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":479470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Plishka","original_name":"Paul Plishka","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/1yIdDZxXR1pyDFGicAP79b47ebR.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dansker","credit_id":"65148c1793bd6900fe4709be","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hammons","original_name":"Thomas Hammons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Bosun","credit_id":"65148c2cc50ad200eabc6687","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Courtney","original_name":"James Courtney","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/olNxjayI7iK6OCGu7eRj46klwvr.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Flint","credit_id":"65148c4e93bd6900e12c0b0e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897682,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eric Crozier","original_name":"Eric Crozier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65148b2893bd6900fe47098a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54442,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"E.M.
