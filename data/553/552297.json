The primary images are of my Bolex-filming nude reflection set within window frames, a pane of glass, and light projected by the rising sun. The film moves forward via on-going exploration of reflected and overlapping images––sustained by light, color, and the rhythmic pulse of a leaky kitchen faucet. A fusion of form and subject is inevitable within a work that is the story of its making.\" - Holly Fisher","popularity":0.1741,"poster_path":"/jC1NcSHwLZVYqtHhC0XGvcBswP0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glass Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1135813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Fisher","original_name":"Holly Fisher","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/AjmBUj9GQm8qUW3NVw1ccmQe6Ir.jpg","credit_id":"5bb77cab0e0a2633a002c606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eW41mguOHk2aIcg9IF6kwSGOO8a.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jC1NcSHwLZVYqtHhC0XGvcBswP0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
