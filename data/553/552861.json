Using previously unseen photographs, self shot video from the band and interviews, this is an intimate look at an important moment in popular culture. Chris candidly talks about the relationship he had with the band and reveals incredible insight into his process, as well as explaining his views on the meaning of the relationship between photographer and subject and what can happen when that professional line becomes blurred.","popularity":0.2675,"poster_path":"/mzHW4r7vtsHqFD0KRWm173vUShA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ad Hoc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Band.
