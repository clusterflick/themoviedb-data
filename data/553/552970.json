Deborah Voigt stars as Ariadne, the mythical heroine abandoned on the island of Naxos by her lover, and Richard Margison is Bacchus, the young god who eventually takes her away to a new life. The spectacular Natalie Dessay as Zerbinetta leads the troupe of comedians who unsuccessfully try to cheer Ariadne up. Susanne Mentzer is delightful as the young Composer of the opera-within-the-opera, and Wolfgang Brendel sings the Music Master.","popularity":0.1677,"poster_path":"/xlsCsRTnJ0u4oGaNYbExfKahfL7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Ariadne auf Naxos","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":266422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Voigt","original_name":"Deborah Voigt","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/oofK3iDXS6FDclhHK8mDWwTWFC5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Prima Donna / Ariadne","credit_id":"5bbcb4179251413793017185","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Dessay","original_name":"Natalie Dessay","popularity":0.2413,"profile_path":"/wppFso5aGmto3Pj5cOU42Z1x2PF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Zerbinetta","credit_id":"5bbcb41f0e0a266618018220","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Margison","original_name":"Richard Margison","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Tenor / Bacchus","credit_id":"5bbcb42792514137900155f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Gunn","original_name":"Nathan Gunn","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/2hhYMy12pjuLzHE8y64Jf1PAQlu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Harlequin","credit_id":"5bbcb4350e0a26660c0181e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1561729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Mentzer","original_name":"Susanne Mentzer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/baSHi8wlbVwNUTFI5YOrN9HLNJt.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The Composer","credit_id":"66c114f8a195242cd1921b42","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugo von Hofmannsthal","original_name":"Hugo von Hofmannsthal","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/7rWtID3q3d2y2EMysEjNW8dq3JH.jpg","credit_id":"6517f7a6967cc700e29cbbf9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","credit_id":"6517f7cb93bd6900e12da0e0","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Strauss","original_name":"Richard Strauss","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yMUgur4kSGUAkMV1ujDKZoJNDri.jpg","credit_id":"6517f795d4653709e1c90cb1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elijah Moshinsky","original_name":"Elijah Moshinsky","popularity":0.1799,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6517f7e9072166011c0104d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6517f7b2a199a600ab1905e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p1UNyVWF73Vhq5PMkvln62YbkFK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlsCsRTnJ0u4oGaNYbExfKahfL7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uyuEYOh0fiKq2ZLBW7AInwWMYww.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
