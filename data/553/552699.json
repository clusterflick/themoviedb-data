We meet Vic, the desk clerk, who paints watercolours and pastels; Jonesy, a janitor who talks about bedbugs; Bruce, a voluble alcoholic who makes runs for residents, picking up beer or sandwiches for them and sharing his philosophy with us; Vinnie, on methadone, caring for caged birds; Cashmere, a prostitute, the only woman at the hotel; Earl, who works downstairs in the Bowery's last factory, and Mike, the general manager, who talks about the changing face of the Bowery. The film concludes with tourists outside the Sunshine, hearing from Seth Kamil of Big Onion Walking Tours.","popularity":0.3229,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sunshine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1609422,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Foster","original_name":"John Foster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404d78fe61e6d00c6587765","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052640,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bryan Gunnar Cole","original_name":"Bryan Gunnar Cole","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404d795021cee0079d22668","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386751,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin Wilson","original_name":"Kevin Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404d7af67dcc900d481f72e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimi Zhivago","original_name":"Jimi Zhivago","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404d7e8021cee00b4febc91","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56409,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erin O'Hara","original_name":"Erin O'Hara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404d7fb392712007cb1efa8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Bertelsen","original_name":"Phil Bertelsen","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbadaeac3a368243703b389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Bertelsen","original_name":"Phil Bertelsen","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbadb72c3a3682418040135","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0264053","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":612,"name":"hotel"},{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":165314,"name":"skid row"},{"id":204981,"name":"the bowery"},{"id":224099,"name":"flophouse"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
