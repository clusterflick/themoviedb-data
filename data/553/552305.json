The American director Frank Capra said of Chocolate and Soldiers \"We can't beat this kind of thing. We make a film like that maybe once in a decade. We haven't got the actors. It shows the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, presenting even enemy Chinese soldiers as brave individuals. It is considered to be a \"humanist\" film, paying close attention to the human feelings of both the soldier and his family. Cinema theorist Kate Taylor-Jones suggests that Chocolate and Soldiers provided \"a vision of the noble, obedient and honourable Japanese army fighting to defend the emperor and Japan.","popularity":0.2384,"poster_path":"/MPp9KEEmjbqHPYXMxWDCWpI4YV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toho Eiga Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1938-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chocolate and Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Chokorēto to Heitai","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamatari Fujiwara","original_name":"藤原釜足","popularity":0.5849,"profile_path":"/jf1aok2Ln5XG805BDzBJc2PjZQg.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb78be6c3a368151a03084b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiyoshi Hosoi","original_name":"Kiyoshi Hosoi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb78bf29251410dc1025af0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuko Ichinose","original_name":"Yuko Ichinose","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb78bfe9251410dc6027abc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1445349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaru Kodaka","original_name":"小高まさる","popularity":0.225,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb78c329251410dbc029d0e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shiro Konishi","original_name":"Shiro Konishi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb78c3e9251410dbc029d20","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shiro Mizutani","original_name":"Shiro Mizutani","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb78c4bc3a368151002f1f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideko Takamine","original_name":"高峰秀子","popularity":0.5332,"profile_path":"/24VkBe4QDZtFRFDDamwkdtKU5wk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Shigeko","credit_id":"5f970192a1074b0036f64080","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1502075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masaru Kobayashi","original_name":"Masaru Kobayashi","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629640d40f21c61539509ca7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3175784,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noriko Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木紀子","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629640e55507e9149380f549","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530003,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noboru Itō","original_name":"伊藤昇","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510074a6f53e10aa674927c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takeshi Sato","original_name":"Takeshi Sato","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb78c76c3a36815260226ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0263203","wikidata_id":"Q19579964","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/MPp9KEEmjbqHPYXMxWDCWpI4YV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1938-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
