He is an orphan, but the love of his life, Puja, is beside him. Being his support memories comes flashing back in her mind or are they realization of something ominous that had happened in the past. Or shouldn't have happened rather. Something which changed their life forever. This is the story of Dur, a story about love, relationships and most importantly realizations. The film, treated through 10 different fights and its realisations in the second half is a unique treatment the writer/director has tried to play with. The film, without being preachy, dwells on the fact that life as it is might not give us a second chanceâ¦a second chance to repent or correct our mistakes.","popularity":0.1129,"poster_path":"/kLtvFbMvoCjupOYEHF08AJxgFZG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Strawberry Magic Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dur","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2142020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amrita Gogoi","original_name":"Amrita Gogoi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/3Z3PankfIhj3p48KesV2qKbGaSC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pooja","credit_id":"5bb728f49251410dd1023d44","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2125717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udayan Duarah","original_name":"Udayan Duarah","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/tGUId3m6P1B4KaQJ7MIsnz512Q0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Manab","credit_id":"5bd94a5f0e0a26506c0086a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bishnu Kharghoria","original_name":"Bishnu Kharghoria","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Samudra","credit_id":"5f60b190069f0e0036a00cb4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1671785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biju Phukan","original_name":"Biju Phukan","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bhairav","credit_id":"5f60b1a1156cc70036dc63b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Achinta Shankar","original_name":"Achinta Shankar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Achinta","credit_id":"5f60b1b2156cc70038e3f785","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142167,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Biplab J.
