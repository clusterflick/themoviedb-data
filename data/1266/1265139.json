In the film we live the perspective of a relative of a victim, on the day of the tragedy, as well as a year after it.  Our purpose is to never let the memory of the crime of Tempe be forgotten. Finally, we feel the need to help in any way we can in bringing real justice to this case, hoping that we are passing a certain message through our creation.","popularity":0.057,"poster_path":"/li1Hd63P2gHC5wDSzrk1iTaosUR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185729,"logo_path":null,"name":"CityFilm
