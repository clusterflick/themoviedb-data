I produced, shot and directed this film. I began shooting 30 years ago and ended up with over 700 hours of footage that was distilled into 85 minutes. This film is about race, love and forgiveness and finally redemption as I explore my Mother's questions about her own heritage and I go on a journey to find the truth that was kept away from us.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2qZT6Fw8CuekaNt6gZVQWRq5fxn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BS","name":"Bahamas"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-01","revenue":300,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Our mother's love for us was unconditional.
