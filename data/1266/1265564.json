Next to pandemics and wars, the issue of global warming has unfortunately taken a back seat. Unfortunately, the problem itself has not, it is more acute and current than ever. We hope that the film will once again draw attention to this important topic! Bo and Moco live in an icy cold world. Moco is blaming the ice for his snotty nose and starts melting it with his Bunsen Burner. At the same time Bo is trying to fix the damage with needle and yarn.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1eb5RXANGsG5QtT6f6IkMB9bLMN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eisnasen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Hofmann","original_name":"Joel Hofmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66045767b02f5e014a214d69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1627715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veronica L.
