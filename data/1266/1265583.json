Desmond coaxes Seth into spending the day in Manhattan promising to return him to the airport to catch his afternoon connecting flight. They careen across rotting bridges in Desmond's '65 GMC pick-up and straight into the brute energy and filth of Desmond's retro-blue collar city existence. The truck breaks down and Desmond drags Seth from one disastrous episode in his life to the next until they end up drunk and exhausted near Desmond's apartment in Williamsburg. Desmond is astonished to see his boyhood idol collapse on the street. In the morning Desmond brings a happy Seth back to the airport and sees him off. Desmond returns to the beach, and with a Herculean effort, tears himself from the grips of his oldest fear; being buried alive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Boneheads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0108416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
