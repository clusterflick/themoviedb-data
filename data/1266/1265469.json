Five small villages had been connected by the road and they were left with a deserted 20 km stretch in the wilderness. Along the road Sami people and finish farmers continue their lives. They still have the road and they have brought really old cars over the ice of Torneträsk so they could drive during summer time. One of the old men that built the road, Sven-Erik Stöckel, writes a letter to the politicians in Kiruna, asking them to finish the road so people do not have to risk their lives getting to the road crossing the dangerous lake of Torneträsk. Will it ever be finished? And what happened to the children that were born as a result of the road workers coming into the wilderness meeting the local girls?","popularity":0.1507,"poster_path":"/wGU7xXDBNX540f9IvLdSKZfd8jv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vindelfilm AB","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2024-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life along a road you cannot reach.","title":"Solitary Road","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Palmgren","original_name":"Johan Palmgren","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/9CRR2Cga2ErkZdLTuXsrLj1Mcir.jpg","credit_id":"669937d25ccb683c2c1a4878","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2279179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaveh Akaber","original_name":"Kaveh Akaber","popularity":0.0576,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669937e02489b02e047654dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Palmgren","original_name":"Johan Palmgren","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/9CRR2Cga2ErkZdLTuXsrLj1Mcir.jpg","credit_id":"669937e8918faf64ba754d3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32759502","wikidata_id":"Q130489023","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c4yLEKAU01PsfUzz6rGgap6LJh9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ulozb9D7h9jKRlfdCJe8OqNA5P.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5CD0Ywxt5LtexFRhf0gNzxVh3L0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/oer1pDp9p1EHNGoQmc3kkIqMVrJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/wGU7xXDBNX540f9IvLdSKZfd8jv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2057,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yl8lkuY5CepBoAdb0ubPEXktsVf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
