Couched in the conceit of a “making of” special, In Her Time depicts Iris behind the scenes, rehearsing lines and describing the artistic process of coming to inhabit her character. Throughout, she deliberates over the demand the film places upon her to master performing pain and victimization. Iris’ Version introduces new content shot from Iris’ iPhone camera, intercutting the “official” footage with reflections on the filmmaking process from the actress’ perspective.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iVHUSeVuLImaCZLsjFtyFUdbLVj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Her Time (Iris Version)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diane Severin Nguyen","original_name":"Diane Severin Nguyen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603f00a7f6c8d017c75f4bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iVHUSeVuLImaCZLsjFtyFUdbLVj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2024 Whitney Biennial","release_date":"2024-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
