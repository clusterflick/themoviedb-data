With great humor, she takes on the role of a filmmaker fighting to adapt a curious story: that of a 19th century countess who is raped by a bear. In periodic voiceover, she ironizes over the foibles of the nightmarish shoot - the fights with the actors, problems with the script and a failing budget - building a satire of the film-world and its vanity.","popularity":0.0548,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La nuit de l'ours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1160008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jackie Raynal","original_name":"Jackie Raynal","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/ejNm5oRLHIUguZlZcbosHa5FtMb.jpg","credit_id":"66048f70ecaef5017aaf0ce5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31862806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
