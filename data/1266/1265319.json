Like bison, pronghorn and other plains animals, Nóouhàh-Toka’na held cultural significance for the Native Americans who lived alongside them. But predator control programs in the mid-1900s reduced the foxes to just 10 percent of their native range.  At the Fort Belknap Indian Community in Montana, members of the Aaniiih and Nakoda tribes are working with the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute and other conservation partners to restore biodiversity and return Nóouhàh-Toka’na to the land.","popularity":0.5471,"poster_path":"/7YWkEivii3aLJarI3wP2tW4CaOI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Nóouhàh-Toka’na","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726995,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roshan Patel","original_name":"Roshan Patel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66039c1c60620a0130260f47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7YWkEivii3aLJarI3wP2tW4CaOI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":10322,"name":"native american"},{"id":207693,"name":"return home"},{"id":211505,"name":"wildlife conservation"},{"id":258541,"name":"biodiversity"},{"id":330441,"name":"swift fox"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
