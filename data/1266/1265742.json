In an increasingly algorithm-and-data-driven 21st century, assumptions made about a child’s mathematical ability affect their odds of finding future success. Unsurprisingly these barriers mostly affect those already suffering under systemic racism, patriarchy, and/or the cycle of poverty who are presumed to have fewer skills. This revealing and urgent documentary weaves together a mosaic of voices and stories across generations and professions to explain the detrimental effects of declining math skills on civic participation, legal rulings, and fulfilling careers. Further, the film challenges the notion that only a select few can be “math people” and illustrates what happens when the myths surrounding math are shattered and mathematics education becomes more inclusive.","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":"/fU3nKRlavpZlYCkRHKnTnlEykkG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Counted Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2156726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicki Abeles","original_name":"Vicki Abeles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6604e94f2811a10186da852c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fU3nKRlavpZlYCkRHKnTnlEykkG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1002}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SFFilm Fest","release_date":"2024-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
