This film is a revealing journey through the worlds of Fashion and Language, exploring how these two, apparently different, ways of expression weave together and influence each other. Through the captivating looks and narratives of our leading roles –photographer David Gomez-Maestre and fashion designer Karim Adduchi– along with the verses of Caterina Albert and Víctor Català, we show how fashion is not just an array of garments, but a statement and a way to communicate identity, thoughts, and emotions. And words, whether as folk narratives, literature, poetry or inspiration, play a crucial role within individual expression.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":"/p0kqVJTq6GUkdKo1rEbsS6aLMQM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224577,"logo_path":null,"name":"la Caixa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fashion vs Words is a fascinating documentary that explores the deep interaction between Fashion and words as a form of human expression.","title":"Fashion vs. Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296667,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claudia Mallart","original_name":"Claudia Mallart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603744f60620a017c2fc072","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3070795,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sonia Martí","original_name":"Sonia Martí","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603746762f335017d552590","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296667,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claudia Mallart","original_name":"Claudia Mallart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66037472197de401861d4ba6","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016031,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michell Rivas","original_name":"Michell Rivas","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603747d0929f6014b9a5d78","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2457838,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Toni Vidal","original_name":"Toni Vidal","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603748a7f6c8d017c757011","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105110,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elena Stombergaite","original_name":"Elena Stombergaite","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660374a00929f6014b9a5d91","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laia Vidal","original_name":"Laia Vidal","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660374b4b84cdd017df7d4e3","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4617170,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Josep Abril","original_name":"Josep Abril","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660374d2197de401631931fa","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4617172,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aleix Fernandez","original_name":"Aleix Fernandez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603752d04733f0164ebea0d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p0kqVJTq6GUkdKo1rEbsS6aLMQM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztGCwFdOrFhY3Bl4CB2oYNyWNNn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"Festival International du Film sur l'Art (Le FIFA)","release_date":"2024-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
