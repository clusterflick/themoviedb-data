In this video, the performer destroys a wardrobe full of VHS tapes labeled ‘Guggenheim´, first with an axe, followed by a ritualistic burning of the wardrobe and tapes. This work deals with the idea of the artist’s dissolution of her own narcissism, her contradicting sentiments towards her own practice and its conflicting relationship with the ‘art institutions’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guggenheim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4617524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Moreno Munoz","original_name":"Marta Moreno Munoz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603e6a1197de40149163b9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
