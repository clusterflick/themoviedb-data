The problem is, every time he hits the bottle old memories come pouring in along with the booze and it's suddenly Friday night all over again. And in Nicky's past, Friday night meant just one thing--after-hours at Lucky's Tavern for a night of drinking and shooting pool with Doug and the boys. Drinks were free, Nine Ball was the game, and everyone knew the rules up front . Or did they?  Guided by his conscience, Nicky is forced to relive what began as a casual night out with the guys and ended with an event so tragic that he has never been able to put it behind him.","popularity":0.532,"poster_path":"/3U6W3nHUA2ukmkLL5h6ZLCjCfxw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212396,"logo_path":null,"name":"What Exit Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine Ball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nine Ball","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Johnson","original_name":"Kenny Johnson","popularity":2.015,"profile_path":"/oFjEvGUEync0f2uiyGxMbinQkEl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nicky","credit_id":"6540c2a86ca9a000ca1595aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Grosso","original_name":"Rich Grosso","popularity":0.2512,"profile_path":"/dNT2pctO3dLtVhwv0aSFkrZtJR9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"George","credit_id":"6540c2cb35818f013a7e3f50","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Bevine","original_name":"Victor Bevine","popularity":0.2876,"profile_path":"/7EgqVTDFQjcraqk7dz3hoBTwu4V.jpg","credit_id":"6540c28835818f00c6a1a74d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donnie Jarman","original_name":"Donnie Jarman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6540c26f33a533014d469b67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0164115","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nWtzApHOBGss6rqXdiooIy8bvnF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3U6W3nHUA2ukmkLL5h6ZLCjCfxw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
