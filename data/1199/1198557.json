Live: From Bethlehem tells MNA's remarkable story. It chronicles the agency's struggles and successes through the eyes of the station's reporters, producers, and photographers, in the process quietly revealing the humanity of ordinary Palestinians as they go about their daily business. The documentary trains its focus on people more than on abstract issues, yet it never loses sight of the myriad social and political forces and pressures that Ma'an journalists are forced to negotiate as they try to gather and report balanced information. What results is an admirably nuanced portrait of how news gets produced, and how Palestinians live, in one of the world's most troubled regions.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live: From Bethlehem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4004829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Sienkiewicz","original_name":"Matt Sienkiewicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653ff6f4519bbb011b4622eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1868635,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Sousa","original_name":"Joseph Sousa","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653ff702bc2cb3010b4c5542","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1381812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
