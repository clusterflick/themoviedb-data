Arte has compiled a decalogy of 10 films from this period from the director's creative work. This short documentary film, created in this context, explains the film works using fragments of Ozu's notes, which he wrote between 1933 and 1963, elegant drawings and film clips. A fine insight into the themes and aesthetics of this moving cinema about intimacy and the passage of time and a fascinating journey into the moving final part of the Japanese master's work.","popularity":0.1423,"poster_path":"/1ECqFJWdAKfCIGVzaNt3EP2MSBN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ozu: The Filmmaker of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Yasujirô Ozu - Le cinéaste du bonheur","type":"alternative spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Ozu, le cinéaste du bonheur","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginie Apiou","original_name":"Virginie Apiou","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65411bef75110d013960fdb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginie Apiou","original_name":"Virginie Apiou","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d2cdffd4f8000c7fef88c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366464,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Girardin","original_name":"Isabelle Girardin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d2d495a5ed0013babcd4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366466,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dorit von Scharpen","original_name":"Dorit von Scharpen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d2d8e5a5ed000e3f5af93","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366463,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Seymour","original_name":"Anne Seymour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d2d3429383500c473127e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2742680,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sylvère Kretzschmar","original_name":"Sylvère Kretzschmar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d2cf61ac2927b2dd017f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366465,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Muriel Thiebac","original_name":"Muriel Thiebac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d2d59d4653700e1a6ccdd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29920455","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ydE8zWtfxL9suZPbuwud95EYuCm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/1PCLm8MGRY122nmyhbYJ6CCXjD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/SMAZ7JufvoVZwpTgYNgBlHdmPT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/asZiHRT8FhiCWnOpOVMC2leVBEz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1ECqFJWdAKfCIGVzaNt3EP2MSBN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pdPBkA0fskTJBUrNHn0UJZXl0eO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Arte.tv","release_date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Arte.tv","release_date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
