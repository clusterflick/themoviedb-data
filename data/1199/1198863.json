It is no longer a question of preventing the warming of the atmosphere, but of knowing precisely what will be the scale of it. Within this research, the role of clouds is still the biggest unknown since we don't know if they will increase or dampen the warming.  The tiny island of Barbados, where the campaign is taking place, is at the forefront of the challenges ahead. Through the successes and failures of the campaign, Barbadians and climatologists explore the fascination that clouds inspire. Somewhere between science, history and poetry, they draw a composite portrait of research.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/grBof52mABY6NLzF8YA2tylnNCu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76117,"logo_path":"/6GBfBiE0nz6kgkNdTku3ls8ZYii.png","name":"Look at Sciences","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do we know about clouds?
