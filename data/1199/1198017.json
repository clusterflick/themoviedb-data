The film investigates the figure of a man who was able to go beyond the codified circuits of the art world: his work ranges from painting to theater, from set design to photography, the applied arts to opera on radio, publishing and advertising design. Fortunato Depero was rediscovered in the late seventies and re-evaluated in the nineties thanks to the attention dedicated to him by some scholars and the keen interest of his works by French and American audiences who saw in him the most significant artist of the Futurist movement.","popularity":0.1469,"poster_path":"/hX5BrSH91jQcR7LSP7aDaiM1t88.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176523,"logo_path":null,"name":"TÃ­pota Movie Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Depero: Rovereto, New York and Other Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2401959,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paola Traverso","original_name":"Paola Traverso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653e6f6e5907de00e1a29b6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nello Correale","original_name":"Nello Correale","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653e6fd2109cd0014df50cfc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27181,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlo Siliotto","original_name":"Carlo Siliotto","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/1kWUSQvBS58riAEEAQM0pmMUWht.jpg","credit_id":"653e6f90c8a5ac00c6d73c48","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nello Correale","original_name":"Nello Correale","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653e6f33e894a600ad5741a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hX5BrSH91jQcR7LSP7aDaiM1t88.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":218166,"name":"futurism"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
