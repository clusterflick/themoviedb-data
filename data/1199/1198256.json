Now, as then, dream and memory give their accounts.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yjDOrnR6yInbcGCX04XclPyhNIa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vidéographe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discours des comètes","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"653f0887519bbb011b45a3e7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"653f085b5907de00ac022617","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4347323,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André Vachon","original_name":"André Vachon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653f089d50733c00adbcef8f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"653f08b3c8a5ac00e3a1ca92","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4347326,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Rivest","original_name":"Claude Rivest","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653f0947109cd0012cfffa89","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4347325,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean Pelletier","original_name":"Jean Pelletier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653f08f1cc9683012cf4a313","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"653f090be894a6013a9cfa12","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728767,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Rivest","original_name":"Claude Rivest","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653f0aaac8a5ac00e3a1cc08","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yjDOrnR6yInbcGCX04XclPyhNIa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":561}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
