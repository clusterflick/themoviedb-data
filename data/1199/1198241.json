More than a thousand dreams about Putin have now been recorded and posted on public platforms.  In Dreams About Putin, a selection of these dreams have been brought to life using Unreal Engine, a 3D graphics program for creating scenes for computer games. In this exciting experiment with form, the animations are complemented by rare archival footage of the Russian president.  The dreams are related by a narrator, and their “translation” into 3D scenes is not literal; likewise, the archival footage has been lightly edited. The result is sometimes dryly comic, sometimes absurdist, sometimes disturbing, and sometimes even hopeful. A series of bizarre but therefore oddly familiar nightmares as a vision of Putin’s Russia.","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":"/hAP4DSmUPcm2V8JW2CgbxEZivg8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214151,"logo_path":"/4uz8vyUKvBNcO1kcKY6tNqKPiEc.png","name":"DocNomads","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams about Putin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"普丁的夢","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2087418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nastia Korkia","original_name":"Nastia Korkia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6YsP2T8b9rS6FCsZej7TLjoRwjd.jpg","credit_id":"653eee4c50733c00c535958e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489533,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vlad Fishez","original_name":"Vlad Fishez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653eee61cc968300ea719ec1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30133484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwATlrIBxuBouqQhqHehkMCfE17.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1274,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hAP4DSmUPcm2V8JW2CgbxEZivg8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":300805,"name":"idfa official selection"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chiayi International Art Doc Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
