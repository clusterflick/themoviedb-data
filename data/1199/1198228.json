We see the yellow and grey image of the small Casio melting down and then becoming whole again. The soundtrack fades, then rises; it's a theme with variations on a theme. This tape would interest those looking for video with an emphasis on special effects, or who like to watch things metamorphose before their very eyes. This is poetry in motion and we are drawn to it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nxDGhJ4qD6gPULiFOxZDXeN17dh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental TV Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Polytechnic World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Raxlen","original_name":"Rick Raxlen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6S2054RYwU48Hj7O10R8aotcBDZ.jpg","credit_id":"653ee718519bbb00fe5d1df5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":898,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nxDGhJ4qD6gPULiFOxZDXeN17dh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1984-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
