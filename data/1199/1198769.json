It's not easy. But as a pediatric palliative care physician, she works to ensure that terminally ill children receive quality end-of-life care. Palliative care is sometimes misunderstood to shorten life expectancy, but it's a method that increases quality of life, improves symptom burden and decreases medical costs. We follow Dr. Tremonti in the short documentary above as she works to make death less medical and more human. In the process she asks a critical question: When a child is terminally ill, how can we make the end of life a better one?","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/hFb3ZCenOy6m1k89XLGNHdw8Tx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying in Your Mother's Arms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2599421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Beder","original_name":"John Beder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6540c3d54557a00100acb919","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1938144,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Newberry","original_name":"James Newberry","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/9YWTOBrZH14EKyuiLodxqqDfN4K.jpg","credit_id":"6577d6607a3c5200ebfe2d8f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15530442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFb3ZCenOy6m1k89XLGNHdw8Tx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
