She's had more than 180 different jobs; she's been president, she's been to the moon, and she's done all the things that women aspire to do. She has a massive closet, and thousands of different outfits. Barbie is way more than just a 12-inches long piece of plastic, she is way more than a toy. The legendary blond bombshell has grown into a phenomenon and a children's sensation. Wildly revolutionary, Barbie broke barriers, shattered glass ceilings, and has inspired countless dreams, wonder and imagination, with her signature color: Pink. The history of the doll is a testament to its enduring appeal and impact. Things have changed for her the same way things changed for women. Whatever we may think about Barbie - love or loathe her - it is impossible to ignore her worldwide impact. Let's step into the beautiful world of Barbie and take a look at her cultural revolution through the decades.","popularity":1.1416,"poster_path":"/jiIkv1y7aeWonHnsE4YE2eJVtFz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Barbie Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28765321","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jiIkv1y7aeWonHnsE4YE2eJVtFz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10542,"name":"based on toy"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":221078,"name":"old footage"},{"id":239463,"name":"film archives"},{"id":296653,"name":"toy brand"},{"id":307425,"name":"barbie fairytopia"},{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"},{"id":322437,"name":"industrial documentary"},{"id":329665,"name":"historical artifacts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
