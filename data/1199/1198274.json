Thus, the research consists in revealing in each sequence incredible light situations wich, as suggested by the title, sometimes depend on atmospheric accidents. Each sequence, as if it where an Illumination will reflect light as a phenomenon. Among these, let us mention mirage, scintillation, dazzle and radiance - manifestations with a halo. Finally, the selected poetic fragments from Rimbaud's Illuminations introduce words that create acoustic sparkles within the space and tension with the image. They do not only increase the semantic potential of the image but also, and hopefully, add starlight to it.\" - Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/qqvrCPaGCvSMCzaXLSDCMofD125.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vidéographe","origin_country":""},{"id":212314,"logo_path":null,"name":"PRIM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Heures d'argent, des illuminations","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2294782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Jolin","original_name":"Carmen Jolin","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"653f1c2ce894a6011ca46b85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4347421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Villeneuve","original_name":"Anne Villeneuve","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"653f1c6a50733c00ff4afd55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2365999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Brault","original_name":"Pierre Brault","popularity":0.0415,"profile_path":"/5cNUnYF1eey32JwM3VxrDroQ7Bi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"voice","credit_id":"67db8c9d08749efe34e792ba","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"653f1cafe894a600ff17a16f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"653f1ccc50733c00adbcff2d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"653f1cd95907de00e1a2e73d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4347424,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stéphane Claude","original_name":"Stéphane Claude","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653f1d0630813100c641a9c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":857,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qqvrCPaGCvSMCzaXLSDCMofD125.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
