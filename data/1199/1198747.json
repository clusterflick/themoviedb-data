It has been taught to millions of students nationwide. The look of the program has been updated, but the information and educational goal remain the same — to teach preteens about their changing bodies and the beginning stages of puberty. This program is provided as a free educational service by the Always® brand of feminine protection products.  Program content is based on national research and consultation with school nurses, health educators, parents, fifth-grade students and medical professionals. It is designed to provide fifth-grade students with a broad overview of the beginning stages of puberty.  This is the 2016 version, and is completely revamped. There are three separate editions - one aimed at girls, one at boys, and a third combined one for a co-ed audience.","popularity":0.1466,"poster_path":"/hjj3a87IwXSTDIA7cZc3RPMOgAi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Always Changing and Growing Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hjj3a87IwXSTDIA7cZc3RPMOgAi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7066,"name":"sex education"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
