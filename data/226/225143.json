These gaps cause divides and arguments and hatred. And because there are so many gaps, there must be a many lessons taught. Gap the movie, tells us that there is a man out there who is teaching this lesson by taking the blood of the ignorant. The rich, who distain and distance themselves from the poor, the \"skater dudes\" slamming in to the aging hippie, the attacks on color and culture, the media's mockery of the overweight. The left and the right are both Americans, but from different worlds. The pretty, pretty pressed against the ugly in disgust. Short and tall, thin and wide, all we can see are the differences. These differences are chips that fall away from our core. We need to open up. We need to stitch the gaps together. Slice the gaps open and then stitch them back together.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":"/qLb20TXllCjcLzXx8fdE6uyRp2i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gap","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul O'Callaghan","original_name":"Paul O'Callaghan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53c370070e0a26158f00ba7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Field","original_name":"Paul Field","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53c370390e0a26158f00ba82","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Finley","original_name":"Melissa Finley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53c370460e0a26157900bfe6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Gilbert","original_name":"Ryan Gilbert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53c370500e0a26158f00ba87","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelly Gray","original_name":"Shelly Gray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"53c370580e0a26158500bea3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David McDonald","original_name":"David McDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53c3706a0e0a26157600c316","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Rehor","original_name":"Ralph Rehor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"53c370730e0a26158900c1c5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Anthony Scardillo","original_name":"Michael Anthony Scardillo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"53c370880e0a26157c00bd2b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Field","original_name":"Paul Field","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c370be0e0a26158200c03a","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88559,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Brian Spears","original_name":"Brian Spears","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c370f90e0a26157900bff5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Anthony Scardillo","original_name":"Michael Anthony Scardillo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c370d20e0a26158900c1cd","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756782,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Ortoski","original_name":"Andrew Ortoski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f47b9609463180038f1f3c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul O'Callaghan","original_name":"Paul O'Callaghan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f47b8aabd101e0037523be8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756781,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason Morillo","original_name":"Jason Morillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f47b940efca000036be45ec","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756780,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anthony Fillippleo","original_name":"Anthony Fillippleo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f47b91c9463180037f1cb0e","department":"Camera","job":"Second Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756780,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anthony Fillippleo","original_name":"Anthony Fillippleo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f47b926efca000036be45a7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom L.
