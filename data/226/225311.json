He challenged the belief that God created the world in seven days, and the theories of people such as Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, who believed that characteristics acquired during a lifetime could be passed on to the next generation. Since then, Darwinian theory has become the accepted scientific doctrine but now an Australian scientist, Ted Steele, is stirring things up again. Is he pursuing a false dream or is he about to change what we know about life on earth? Reputations, careers and our understanding of evolution are all on the line.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ted's Evolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
