He looks for the three witnesses who can testify that Lawson shot only in self defense in killing a gambler, but the witnesses are terrorized by another gambler, town boss Rock McCleary, who shoots witness Pop Roberts Morgan. Fatally wounded, Pop gives Gene the information needed to clear Lawson, then dies crying the \"Ghost Riders\" are coming for him. Gene then heads for a showdown with McCleary.","popularity":1.1893,"poster_path":"/nU3EZYZR5sIXdleHCdZWFMSwHPI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gene and Champion Ride To Glory!... as the range echoes to the stirring strains of the great cowboy ballad!","title":"Riders in the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Autry","original_name":"Gene Autry","popularity":0.242,"profile_path":"/tpR8uEfcVmlQA1mQlg4CyljLfMz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gene Autry","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c7515262b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Champion","original_name":"Champion","popularity":0.3239,"profile_path":"/eFwxeWH5ZMJnsV7uGUSAnE63aMc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Champ, Gene's Horse","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c7515262f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Henry","original_name":"Gloria Henry","popularity":0.2289,"profile_path":"/7zhWw6Kob77L9rIT3i6xJLmoOhN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Anne Lawson","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c75152633","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Buttram","original_name":"Pat Buttram","popularity":0.5154,"profile_path":"/jRVB0shCimyljcDYlIUpdcAVe8E.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"'Chuckwalla'","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c75152637","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Beth Hughes","original_name":"Mary Beth Hughes","popularity":0.3673,"profile_path":"/25Hi4J133OcCfrBkrlnZVZDAvGJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Julie Stewart","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c7515263b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Livingston","original_name":"Robert Livingston","popularity":0.2222,"profile_path":"/9TDnvUPeWnBS7mPeGeIlHhTLLIe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"'Rock' McCleary","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c7515263f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Darrell","original_name":"Steve Darrell","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/mPADuDDsXkXBaxl51CAKQCVpH0r.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ralph Lawson","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c75152643","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Hale Jr.","original_name":"Alan Hale Jr.","popularity":0.5557,"profile_path":"/13hyaSRqAe9LTkGTp4iEyZQO5Il.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Marshal Riggs","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c75152647","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom London","original_name":"Tom London","popularity":0.2025,"profile_path":"/nfLW8J3AMasTu1Ahm0HftRgx9qy.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Old Man Robert","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c7515264b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Donnelly","original_name":"Paul Donnelly","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ac54711a3248004013d41c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126373,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Harold H.
