Aurelia lives happily with her family. Just before the birth of her third daughter, her husband dies in an accident. Years later, Leonor, the oldest daughter, has quit her studies to help her mother support the household. Beatriz, immersed in her music, lets life slip her by like a strange melody. Adolescent Nadia has only one interest in life: to seek new experiences. Aurelia starts to lose her sensibility to pain, and the family relationships become so alienated that they begin to disintegrate like the house they live in.","popularity":0.6386,"poster_path":"/iax7IlteEE2T9nhXdleepRLLQPM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":299,"logo_path":"/elssmtHcogGtF8Gxokh9phZvLKi.png","name":"Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":88614,"logo_path":"/jpid5wWEkbpSqRTsHdJjWwzLWv8.png","name":"UNAM","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":27880,"logo_path":"/yt24dH6cML0ovAtPMtt4quBeNdA.png","name":"Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos (CUEC)","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2008-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La vida inmune","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Beato","original_name":"Carmen Beato","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/bTqvweMdgGb2KeFvEixrnKvWL2a.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5492320ac3a3683cfe0004ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1099283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocío Verdejo","original_name":"Rocío Verdejo","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/nx6g9yIuqLn9nLZB6OrXoyeLpYf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"549232159251410918000478","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Rodríguez","original_name":"Sandra Rodríguez","popularity":0.1414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54923220c3a3683d0d0004d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Carlos Remolina","original_name":"Juan Carlos Remolina","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":"/i98MFVsum0M7JwcGAT4dBNlP9Ka.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5492324e925141090c0004f4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Porras","original_name":"Gabriel Porras","popularity":0.1566,"profile_path":"/qKcw5P6SuxbjynoKFrK42Kg0LYT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd33ccaab6d4c34977ff9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400674,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramón Cervantes","original_name":"Ramón Cervantes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54923290925141090e000502","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400674,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramón Cervantes","original_name":"Ramón Cervantes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5492328492514109130004eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0787235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iax7IlteEE2T9nhXdleepRLLQPM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
