His father is drafted and the boy’s cozy home changes into the cold walls of a barracks flat. His central focus becomes the world of child fantasy and imagination. The director has made an attempt at capturing the thoughts, dreams and anxieties of one child, which sets out on a journey to the centre of the Earth, while the adult hero remembering his childhood sets out on a journey to the centre of himself. The rhythm of the story flows just like a nocturne, a lyrical musical piece expressing a night mood. The director’s ambition was not to create a realistic film, but to try to transpose a child’s fantasies into images.","popularity":0.1212,"poster_path":"/km2WstejHLGp9WfVdwCwtPH7vTz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archipel 33>35","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nocturnes","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quentin Testas","original_name":"Quentin Testas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"L'aîné","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751525e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zacharie Olivet","original_name":"Zacharie Olivet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Le cadet","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751525eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":231433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Grappin","original_name":"Sarah Grappin","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/4MNBgXgBAgNpit8cES0amVdCjal.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"La mère","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751525ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miquel García Borda","original_name":"Miquel García Borda","popularity":0.3079,"profile_path":"/cAw6py4F8VjJ0QScGxCTkw6CE99.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Le père","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751525f3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230859,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry Colomer","original_name":"Henry Colomer","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751525dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230859,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry Colomer","original_name":"Henry Colomer","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751525e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0922532","wikidata_id":"Q65153271","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/km2WstejHLGp9WfVdwCwtPH7vTz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
