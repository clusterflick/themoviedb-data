Writer-director Nakamura Daisuke adapts that story to film with Shiwase Come On, his directorial debut. The film covers the marriage of Tetsuya's mother and yakuza father, his mother's drug habit, his stay at an orphanage and his reconciliation with his mother after becoming an adult. In addition to writing and performing the film's theme song, Matsumoto Tetsuya also composed the score to this touching film. In 2011, Shiawase Come On won Grand Prix at the 2011 Okuradashi Film Festival, a film festival dedicated to screening unreleased Japanese films.","popularity":0.5557,"poster_path":"/fxzG0ncyijR7TWIikGaNKUaXPUX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come On, Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Adachi","original_name":"Yuri Adachi","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c75156117","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuyuki Asano","original_name":"浅野和之","popularity":0.3675,"profile_path":"/ArQb7bTT5fuN6g29qY6QmKDRYAS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c7515611b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":811254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masayuki Imai","original_name":"今井雅之","popularity":0.236,"profile_path":"/wR1V6mQ7I8NQKtBD3Jt2dBOur6x.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c7515611f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuma Ishigaki","original_name":"石垣佑磨","popularity":0.5005,"profile_path":"/xyTh2U2Cm9mVc4wdcCL2jS85cpp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tetsuya","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c75156123","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":545394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuki Kazamatsuri","original_name":"風祭ゆき","popularity":1.2663,"profile_path":"/yGi9z2kzcEAKRntfzjAg6GMS9pI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c75156127","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sawa Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木砂羽","popularity":0.4205,"profile_path":"/fh3qORqgkUOkjeRKDiZuMI29Z4t.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fumie","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c7515612b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211273,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yoshiaki Yamamoto","original_name":"Yoshiaki Yamamoto","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c75156143","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211272,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tetsuya Matsumoto","original_name":"Tetsuya Matsumoto","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c7515613d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211274,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kiyokazu Miura","original_name":"Kiyokazu Miura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c75156149","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211270,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daisuke Nakamura","original_name":"Daisuke Nakamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c7515614f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211271,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenji Miyagawa","original_name":"Kenji Miyagawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c75156137","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211270,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daisuke Nakamura","original_name":"Daisuke Nakamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c75156131","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2261982","wikidata_id":"Q11268721","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fxzG0ncyijR7TWIikGaNKUaXPUX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Come On, Happiness","key":"M42sFSA6L2Q","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2014-12-25T02:38:18.000Z","id":"5cc8d2d00e0a265283efce1f"}]}}}
