Desperate to be someone\r in life—and to pay off his debts—he embarks on a journey into the\r increasingly magnetic world of big-box Christianity. Religion seems\r to offer a quick path to becoming rich and soon González is willing\r to do anything in his power in order to make it happen. A thriller that\r evokes the gritty style of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, Gonzalez:\r The False Prophet is a suspenseful ride through the darker side of\r charismatic preachers and upstart religions that flourish on the hardearned\r money of desperate people in need of hope.","popularity":0.3491,"poster_path":"/pV2uoaYJgYUok9ZmE1VlDpD2orU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chacal Filmes","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":17118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Echasa","origin_country":""},{"id":9980,"logo_path":"/tvtK88MhdxjOZN3zSeyrkP8iWd1.png","name":"Fondo para la Producción Cinematográfica de Calidad","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"González: The False Prophet","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"Gonzalez - Falsos Profetas","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Gonzalez - Falsos Profetas","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gonzalez - Falsos Profetas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Bardem","original_name":"Carlos Bardem","popularity":0.342,"profile_path":"/4eVSnaYe4O06BNZjuw8UHnWaqB5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pastor Elías","credit_id":"52fe4e649251416c75154e59","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Torres","original_name":"Harold Torres","popularity":0.2504,"profile_path":"/lOAED2Que041vtPP0bKuBYE2xVr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"González","credit_id":"52fe4e649251416c75154e5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Segura","original_name":"Olga Segura","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/vo8wfJSgeOpvCofRDur2fdoEwBB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Betsabé","credit_id":"52fe4e649251416c75154e61","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1106685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Peterson","original_name":"Gaston Peterson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pablo","credit_id":"52fe4e649251416c75154e65","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christian Díaz Pardo","original_name":"Christian Díaz Pardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e649251416c75154e4f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christian Díaz Pardo","original_name":"Christian Díaz Pardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e649251416c75154e49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085137,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fernando del Razo","original_name":"Fernando del Razo","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e649251416c75154e55","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3174318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/125SVrxbK8miSXZla9UjUKOOuay.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/pV2uoaYJgYUok9ZmE1VlDpD2orU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1426,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/dbtfvfrlRUCWvvVoVV2jzrfyE01.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Casa CANÍBAL","release_date":"2019-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
