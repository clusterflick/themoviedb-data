The official position is almost 400 years old, and the job consists of sitting at a big desk, having lunch meetings with other governors, cutting ribbons at opening ceremonies, holding speeches and eating dinner with the King and Queen of Sweden. It is hard work, but someone has to do it. Björck gives the viewer full access, making this personal portrait both humorous and very, very serious.","popularity":0.163,"poster_path":"/vAl2obalbNLp6X1nySFY9RI1eqG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6159,"logo_path":"/pbWyMDcAM6s228tiUxjl3v1OAxr.png","name":"Helsinki-filmi","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":84233,"logo_path":"/h9uR2PcH9yyYsVt3iXD6YP4zj52.png","name":"Anagram","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2008-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Governor","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anders Björck","original_name":"Anders Björck","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xEjZFrvnebgNhqedN8eJsRVcI1t.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b8d6a27c3a36852090501d4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Måns Månsson","original_name":"Måns Månsson","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/9n1DRjOHfdRycslTDnfbgrebKAI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e6f9251416c751564d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Måns Månsson","original_name":"Måns Månsson","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/9n1DRjOHfdRycslTDnfbgrebKAI.jpg","credit_id":"58f7a95ac3a3686cd1000502","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sadri Cetinkaya","original_name":"Sadri Cetinkaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7a9fec3a3686c8c0004f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Måns Månsson","original_name":"Måns Månsson","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/9n1DRjOHfdRycslTDnfbgrebKAI.jpg","credit_id":"58f7aa15c3a3686c47000513","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleksi Bardy","original_name":"Aleksi Bardy","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":"/mj7TDCzg7fqt5lLsYGyXcXQMsdu.jpg","credit_id":"58f7a980c3a3686ca800045d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47325,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Persson","original_name":"Martin Persson","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7a9b992514170e20004f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391356,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anders Jedenfors","original_name":"Anders Jedenfors","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7da08c3a3684549000719","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1799548,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrik Strömdahl","original_name":"Patrik Strömdahl","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7da1cc3a36845290006a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799551,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Per Legelius","original_name":"Per Legelius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7da6792514137430006dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799547,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Eivergård","original_name":"Sara Eivergård","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7d9db9251413743000682","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799549,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Barkenäs","original_name":"Thomas Barkenäs","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7da409251413749000687","department":"Editing","job":"Digital Intermediate"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1310504","wikidata_id":"Q18242200","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/sAJx2awlXuaLhZexGZvsHXyxVdE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/vAl2obalbNLp6X1nySFY9RI1eqG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
