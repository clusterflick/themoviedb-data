The community pulls together and adapts to a simpler way of life, but their success draws the attention of the less resourceful residents in the area and soon results in a war between subdivisions. This is their story. Written by Anonymous  A catastrophic solar flare plunges Earth into global darkness. As society teeters on the edge of total anarchy the President and top government officials are swept away to a Cold War bunker in search of a solution. While the politicians fight insanity and each other, a group of middle-class suburbanites take survival into their own hands. With bullets and seeds, this neighborhood of schoolteachers and businessmen transform themselves into a village of self-sustaining warriors. Can they hold on until power is restored, or will they fall to the starving masses?","popularity":0.686,"poster_path":"/2btqw9hZQl2KD7lZtzqTcblwJ6B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26135,"logo_path":null,"name":"AfterLight Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remnants","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Sizemore","original_name":"Tom Sizemore","popularity":0.9432,"profile_path":"/soINOuacuiThRb2LyPD4tTWve7C.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"General Vincent Tate","credit_id":"53ae806e0e0a265986003e7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilbur Fitzgerald","original_name":"Wilbur Fitzgerald","popularity":0.4801,"profile_path":"/2s0MtvrLkzb4zGQyLeJLmUWoEWU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"President Marshall Erwin","credit_id":"53ae80800e0a265983003f89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Van","original_name":"Alex Van","popularity":0.1698,"profile_path":"/dmlJAVxxbTFru0LIXEqomKQlOk2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Scott Fehrman","credit_id":"53ae80960e0a265983003f8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Pralgo","original_name":"Robert Pralgo","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/lF2UcQemojihJM4XlLGkWEEsJuJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Art Bernard","credit_id":"53ae80a80e0a26598c004051","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Minarovich","original_name":"Adam Minarovich","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/g1oCEy906bzRiZUqwqEscT6EXZ9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Secretary Pierce Brown","credit_id":"53ae80b80e0a265979003fdc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Welborn","original_name":"Justin Welborn","popularity":0.2732,"profile_path":"/pdtbHGo6slXfbtPlzZY5gW3aj0V.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Brian Sears","credit_id":"53ae80c90e0a26598c004057","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanelle","original_name":"Vanelle","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gwen Bernard","credit_id":"53ae80e00e0a265975004025","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1390415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Sill","original_name":"Donald Sill","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Merl","credit_id":"547851f09251416a270003e0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1390419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David J.
