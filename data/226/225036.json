Dusty's good-hearted but weak-willed brother Harry, adding to his $3000 gambling debt to Willis, reluctantly agrees to pay it off by allowing the Ringo Kid, Burrows' vicious hired gun, to rustle cattle from his sister's ranch. Kansas intervenes, deters the rustlers and persuades Harry to confess his involvement to Dusty. Kansas, sent into town by Dusty to pay off Harry's debts, suddenly finds himself on the wrong side of the law, wrongly accused of murder and must rely on Dusty's belief in his innocence for his salvation.","popularity":0.729,"poster_path":"/5RWEI5Tb9MocTWvQYodsT6xYf5l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ambush in Arizona...with Tim and Chito finding gun trouble and a girl in danger!","title":"Riders of the Range","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Holt","original_name":"Tim Holt","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/n8QRZsiwJetjSztTy0g7oqViWE7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kansas Jones","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751526a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Martin","original_name":"Richard Martin","popularity":0.24,"profile_path":"/cd2B3ZYgqsWfOWZPIKqDXp4QpnK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Chito Rafferty","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751526a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline White","original_name":"Jacqueline White","popularity":0.3771,"profile_path":"/sWwxHJr6UEX53bP2seZifT9mUG7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Priscilla 'Dusty' Willis","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751526ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reed Hadley","original_name":"Reed Hadley","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/jOt6OKSEuvwNuKA3KmCaXhN6f2I.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clint Burrows","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751526b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Barrat","original_name":"Robert Barrat","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/beNgSV6zWEfGV1ikiPGz94uMbOS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sheriff Cole","credit_id":"582f18d09251417f490024bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Clarke","original_name":"Robert Clarke","popularity":0.2179,"profile_path":"/9xnaWYIQUKdgFVrn76yeIg0H0RG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Harry Willis","credit_id":"582f18e29251413e7f00bb8d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Tyler","original_name":"Tom Tyler","popularity":0.3825,"profile_path":"/zvp2SbUJiFfmZN95hVf0erT8cAo.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"The Ringo Kid","credit_id":"582f18f09251410207002625","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Tannen","original_name":"William Tannen","popularity":0.3975,"profile_path":"/kFaa9E96ueuQhG5MQxDWL7t6JLt.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Trump Dixon","credit_id":"582f1914c3a368409b0025d7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11997,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Swink","original_name":"Robert Swink","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627cf6b9fd4a960050b051a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesley Selander","original_name":"Lesley Selander","popularity":0.2174,"profile_path":"/7iJa6w1AkYk2L72YR0QjbJrVI3C.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e509251416c751526a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4681,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Sawtell","original_name":"Paul Sawtell","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62db7a1b5aadc40054136df3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337168,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Feild M.
