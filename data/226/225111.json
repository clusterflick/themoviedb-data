But as any fan of Clint Eastwood, especially after he started directing 30 years ago, will attest, the award-winning star is also an inveterate jazz lover who has uniquely integrated that musical form into the scores of his films. Join Joshua Redman, Christian McBride, Flip Phillips, Charles McPherson, James Rivers, Slide Hampton, Hank Jones, Thelonious Monk Jr., the Kyle Eastwood Quartet, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band and more for this scintillating celebration of film and music.","popularity":0.5102,"poster_path":"/k9qsNlv7zOi2LdmOW5sTx6M02H9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhapsody Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":171,"logo_path":"/bqLWwuNCHcY3IjB5e4o29h7l80D.png","name":"Malpaso Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eastwood After Hours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Barron","original_name":"Kenny Barron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clint Eastwood","original_name":"Clint Eastwood","popularity":3.1437,"profile_path":"/8TwdCfeOZH7ucRlfLZ6wObxa7cO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c77","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Eastwood","original_name":"Kyle Eastwood","popularity":0.2856,"profile_path":"/no2TuwiRS6tgcpg61wGS4ndttFn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c7b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Faddis","original_name":"Jon Faddis","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c7f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Harris","original_name":"Barry Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c83","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":196726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Redman","original_name":"Joshua Redman","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/b1ZuzAkWqpZeUGLwfRByi4zkEYR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c87","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":960692,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Phil Ramone","original_name":"Phil Ramone","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c8b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flip Phillips","original_name":"Flip Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c8f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles McPherson","original_name":"Charles McPherson","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c93","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Mahogany","original_name":"Kevin Mahogany","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c97","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Scott","original_name":"Jimmy Scott","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c9b","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay McShann","original_name":"Jay McShann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c9f","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1057984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Ricker","original_name":"Bruce Ricker","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210642,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Woodward","original_name":"Richard Woodward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e539251416c75152c6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0372883","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k9qsNlv7zOi2LdmOW5sTx6M02H9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
