One day, as Carola leaves the building, Brandt catches her in the stairwell and proposes she \"visit\" him at his apartment after everyone has gone to bed. Shocked and offended at his brazenness, she complains to the building manager, who orders Brandt to leave. He refuses, so the Pointers decide that they will move out instead. While they're packing, the police show up at their apartment with some bad news--Brandt has been found murdered, shot in the head.  Inspector Muller, the detective investigating the murder, discovers that there is more to this case than meets the eye.","popularity":0.8557,"poster_path":"/g4WNj3PFnZ7qF849Uje6igMWKJP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
