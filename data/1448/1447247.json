The prosecution argues that poor weather conditions tarnish company appearances, ultimately affecting customer perception and profits. The film suggests that the solution to these \"crimes\" lies in proper maintenance and protection against the elements. Through a visual exploration of how weather impacts service stations and the importance of maintaining a clean, inviting image, the film underscores the significance of visual appeal in customer retention and brand success.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Case of the Blurred Image","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Jensen","original_name":"Jim Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67d58273790d78633a0131b8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300015,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Magna Films","original_name":"Magna Films","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d1b75666892bad6281740e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306030,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James B.
