A city becomes a fantastic version of itself; a new creature that erupts in the streets and then disappears. In Procession, awareness is given a richly dimensional vantage point on this phenomenon. The paradeâ€™s flow is intensely modulated by editing, folded into itself again and again. Waves of transformation surge through a fabric of recurring moments, until the river of time swells and floods its banks. Also available as a muli-channel installation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8aQ6rscCUzNw2NL06dmQpqbIKzo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Procession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d1bd82434c98c8ec817f29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8aQ6rscCUzNw2NL06dmQpqbIKzo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
