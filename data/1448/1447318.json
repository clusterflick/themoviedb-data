Radigue transmitted a new score image (or ‘living score’ as she calls them), an image associated with water, to film-maker Satz and long-term musical collaborators Davies and Eckhardt. Rather than producing a film that documents the music and sits outside of it, the film participates in the logic of the score and is developed in an open weave with the composer and musicians.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Occam Delta XX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aura Satz","original_name":"Aura Satz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d1d22b325e62b3d1606b3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
