They perform a simple recipe while entertaining the audience with their witty chatter about body politics, institutional access to hormones and everything thatâ€™s problematic about heteronormativity. Using the kitchen as a battleground for addressing gender politics, the cooking show aims to undermine patriarchal society and fantasise about greater freedom and autonomy for all.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/gAu8G5KhUF9lBVI0H0BD2fh1vQh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Housewives Making Drugs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Maggic","original_name":"Mary Maggic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d1d52642c0ccc3ca1e3fcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1424,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gAu8G5KhUF9lBVI0H0BD2fh1vQh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":949}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
