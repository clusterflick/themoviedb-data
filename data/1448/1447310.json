After the radical Islamic Taliban seized power, she was forced to flee the country and is now struggling to build a new life in Germany. Since girlhood, this young Afghan has dreamt of flying to the moon – a dream that suddenly seems within her grasp yet remains impossible to achieve. Stuck between the burden of her past, German bureaucracy and her own ambitions, Amena embarks upon a mission to find her place on earth. In atmospheric images of this and other worlds, Little Universe portrays an ambitious Afghan woman who questions our perceptions of refugee women.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":256111,"logo_path":null,"name":"EIKON Media","origin_country":""},{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Universe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nele Dehnenkamp","original_name":"Nele Dehnenkamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d2177ca1f36ecddc1de3f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300883,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonas Römmig","original_name":"Jonas Römmig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d21d69a97c646cb5810748","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300885,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Torsten Striegnitz","original_name":"Torsten Striegnitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d21da02ea1389f9f607a07","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300890,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jana Irmert","original_name":"Jana Irmert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d21de1eedb53e52c1dd52e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300892,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sirius Kestel","original_name":"Sirius Kestel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d21e07d4f741373260b841","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2552474,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Rother","original_name":"Thomas Rother","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8898765c5222f399443a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nele Dehnenkamp","original_name":"Nele Dehnenkamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc88bcea80d851759a4d4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
