The vertical frames, as usual, represent time, but here there are horizontal frames that represent parallel universes. This piece illustrates a diagonal movement across that field of frames, so that worlds continuously melt into similar worlds, always in-between realities. If these imaginary filmstrips are cut, twisted and turned back on themselves, the image changes abruptly. In keeping with the philosophy and the mood of the piece, a cellular automata program (Wolframtones) was used to create artificial mathematical melodies that constantly shift from one strange tonal system to another.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ilxpwqIF6Wffr1wJLKZ9m5sfOv6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diagonal Drift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d1c39b27c3960c2d1e2cd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306699,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lynnie McElwee","original_name":"Lynnie McElwee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d60707191868c54ff16e77","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306870,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wesley Petty","original_name":"Wesley Petty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6071531678cc3f8014ace","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ilxpwqIF6Wffr1wJLKZ9m5sfOv6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
