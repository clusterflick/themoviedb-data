The film unfolds with tenderness, capturing the weight of what’s lost and the longing to bridge a gap that isn’t just about language but about belonging. Hauntingly beautiful images and a carefully layered soundscape guide the film as it traces the journey of the boy and of the fish: from the water to the hands of fishermen, into freezers and pans, touched by many along the way, and ultimately finding its way into the boy’s arms.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/tcB5HjUXeC8TcoolyX0ucRbPBsl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tila•pia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Crispin Yanisi","original_name":"Crispin Yanisi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d1d5d53602026906816b37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241504,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wietger Mosch","original_name":"Wietger Mosch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d2dd5f3fa0a67cdf1df91c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5302032,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Willkamayu Oomen","original_name":"Willkamayu Oomen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d2dd93d4f741373260dde4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tcB5HjUXeC8TcoolyX0ucRbPBsl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Courtisane Festival","release_date":"2025-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
