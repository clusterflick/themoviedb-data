Octavia Hicks sees in the cultured but unpretentious Sylvia a good match for her son Henry and invites the young woman to visit the Hicks home. Two other visitors, Frank Hayward and his accomplice Annie, are masquerading as a count and a princess in order to con the country-born millionaires out of their money. The two are introduced to Sylvia, who soon discovers their plots and exposes them. A mysterious foreign gentleman appears and announces that the fashion model is actually the Princess Sylvia of Karalyn, but she renounces her title to marry Henry.","popularity":0.1788,"poster_path":"/mKWq89JrxHRSpathuw309KYapZO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Sylvia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Castleton","original_name":"Barbara Castleton","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":"/vPgiKvXpaFDiGBeqZ9mDHQOtmuV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sylvia","credit_id":"67d24336325e62b3d16089cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Hines","original_name":"Johnny Hines","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/zvTdXSM69BPFWhuvH8aMqG7KTti.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Henry Hicks","credit_id":"67d2433f434c98c8ec819d1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1982067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Drumier","original_name":"Jack Drumier","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/zlP3ZtlDIEp3ZdTgJlUYCpk1zLy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zebulon Hicks","credit_id":"67d2434d434c98c8ec819d2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Berkeley","original_name":"Gertrude Berkeley","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Octavia Hicks","credit_id":"67d243563fa0a67cdf1de03c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1945940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklyn Hanna","original_name":"Franklyn Hanna","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/otcmZet8eoHIBSCYTdVyXMGiuQt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"J.
