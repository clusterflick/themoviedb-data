As well as content from the festival there is also footage of Genesis at the sound check as they run through their then current single \"Many Too Many\". Featured from the Genesis set that evening is a full performance of \"The Lady Lies\" from their album of the time \"Then There Were Three\". The film also takes a revealing look at the stage and sound system assembly during the week leading up to the concert and how the British weather can often make open air festival promoters in the UK suffer. There is also an exclusive and in depth interview with promoter Freddy Bannister who gives an insight on what it was like to stage the one day event; just one of a series of hugely successful Knebworth Festivals that he promoted during the seventies.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qukJLNErxcZuPg4QgbZ0GWCkebi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remember Knebworth 1978: Featuring Genesis - A Midsummer Night's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qukJLNErxcZuPg4QgbZ0GWCkebi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD VPDVD42","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
