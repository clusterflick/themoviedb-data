It was created for acclaimed Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, who requested the Ashton commission and whose personality is at the heart of the work. The male Principal role is characterised by exceptionally fluent leaps, turns and lightness of movement. It is twinned with the strength and grace of the ballerina, a role created on the pure, fleet-footed style of former Royal Ballet Principal Lesley Collier. The ballet is set to Sergei Rachmaninoff’s well-known Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, which moves from stormy passages to calmer interludes. The premiere of Rhapsody was given at the Royal Opera House in honour of Ashton’s close friend Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on the occasion of her 80th birthday.","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/81orwEUSNSXjDAuruz3f6MPHdMN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rhapsody","title":"Rhapsody","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Osipova","original_name":"Natalia Osipova","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":"/6KfDoNhF5gYAFXcSyhrimjZUFaL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dancer 1","credit_id":"67d1e2b327c3960c2d1e3397","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven McRae","original_name":"Steven McRae","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":"/nFLOuUrmiyORCotSo07wxlPHQpd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer 2","credit_id":"67d1e2c42575f01b3a606f94","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/81orwEUSNSXjDAuruz3f6MPHdMN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4GaEKgNJJcwgUIzhhyKsKFONaTH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
