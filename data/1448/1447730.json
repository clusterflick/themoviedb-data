The first dozen or so seconds of the etude are actually an abstract film. Thick liquids of various colors spread on a smooth surface. Over time, the frame is increasingly filled with regular geometric patterns, short shots of machine details, first close-up shots of fragments of shoes, and after a while shots of Wellington boots in full view on a single-color background. At the end of the film, still photographs showing women's legs in Wellington boots are also incorporated into its structure. Finally, we see models wearing autumn coats and colorful Stomil Wellington boots. The closing sequence of the film consists of a pulsating company logo interspersed with shots of legs in Wellington boots. Their image was multiplied by dividing the screen into small squares.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jpCpcpdEXa1sWIUC6Zmz4HQwHzm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stomil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1750377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tadeusz Junak","original_name":"Tadeusz Junak","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d2c5ef067c4ca7b0606bc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":2284,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jpCpcpdEXa1sWIUC6Zmz4HQwHzm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
