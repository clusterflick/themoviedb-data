In archival footage of performances from stages around the world, we celebrate her talent as one of the best mezzo-sopranos in the repertoire. During the journey, we try to answer the question, “Why does everyone want to be in the room with Flicka?” Quickly one realizes it’s because, from family to friends, colleagues to opera fans, and those whose lives she touches in her community, all feel she is a hero, friend and mentor.","popularity":0.0765,"poster_path":"/ekmqkEuz2mxA6iWoASOGlvXqjKU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paper Wings Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flicka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederica von Stade","original_name":"Frederica von Stade","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/gp6C54Aw1s6kxBm0eFsOyPSWLi.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d26953eedb53e52c1de1ad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Staufenbiel","original_name":"Brian Staufenbiel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d268b12575f01b3a608812","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4517478,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diane B.
