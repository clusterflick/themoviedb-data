The famous mountaineer Catherine Destival also fell for the high mountains and is repeatedly bounding, rock walls and glaciers. The love of mountaineering drives them to incredible records: she wants to prove itself, challenge the elements and feel one with the imposing high mountain landscape.

Their origin is not in the Alps, but in Great Britain, where climbing passion is still widespread today.","popularity":0.1172,"poster_path":"/bfRzhLMmDuiyjdRmkPvp4ckxpR4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grande-Bretagne, voyage aux sources de l'alpinisme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Großbritannien – Reise zum Ursprung des Bergsteigens","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5302577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Perazio","original_name":"Vincent Perazio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d31ab7a97c646cb5813dd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertrand Delapierre","original_name":"Bertrand Delapierre","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/hyBFTuWSpmGVjeRAyr1ANj7tIhP.jpg","credit_id":"67d31ac3434c98c8ec81cc9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8nslDHanoXtfjQCMGv5E1aYLLcd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/nMsERzLOFGzSYksCuumqEFTKegD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bfRzhLMmDuiyjdRmkPvp4ckxpR4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
