He installed automatic temperature, humidity, and irrigation systems to help with growing different species of plants, and outfitted his greenhouse with automatic photofloods, iron window shutters, and an army of Bell & Howell “Filmo Model 70” 16mm cameras mounted on dolleys. The nerve center of all of this was an elaborate setup of switch panels and controls connected to a timer. Ott’s automatic greenhouse was called “ingenious” by American Cinematographer in 1947.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1947-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomatoe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Nash Ott","original_name":"John Nash Ott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wu42mszG3WH7ZkOEapLNvP5BedZ.jpg","credit_id":"67d120f866892bad62815289","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
