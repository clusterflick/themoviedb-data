Drawing from her family archive, the film addresses the complexities of the mother-daughter relationship, often defined by unspoken tensions and unresolved histories. These dynamics are further explored within the context of mixed heritage between Japan and Germany, where differing life experiences shape their connection. These complexities unfold through a delicate interplay of fragmented images, archival material, and evocative soundscapes. Schedelbauer’s distinct formal approach, a meticulous choreography of light, texture, and rhythm, invites the viewer into the layered emotional terrain of their relationship, which, like personal history and cultural identity, is shaped by time and memory.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/ys8OA9wWc0ru7h7B1OGS9gIDBWM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Letter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvia Schedelbauer","original_name":"Sylvia Schedelbauer","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/iwEk8JlMUNGjPP4ACrEXnBfWpn0.jpg","credit_id":"67d1d675a1f36ecddc1dd376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ys8OA9wWc0ru7h7B1OGS9gIDBWM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
