Probably not many. Irantzu Varela and Andrea Momoitio are two trailblazing journalists who decide to transform a century-old bridal atelier into the city's first feminist cultural center: La Sinsorga. They aim to complete the renovation using only women and use the project to create a database of women in the heavily male-dominated construction sector. Five female workers are tasked with rebuilding this former symbol of romantic love. Over the course of a year, we witness the transformation unfold through a narrative where the everyday realities of construction coexist with a performative universe, revealing their fears and desires.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/1YAjc2YJJfuWp4Lfatrwt9AceN6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Me Sinsorga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Momoitio","original_name":"Andrea Momoitio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f6ce13d0e96b427b96bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irantzu Varela","original_name":"Irantzu Varela","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f6da0525f3d74f011611","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rakel García","original_name":"Rakel García","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f6e60525f3d74f011626","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatriz Silva","original_name":"Beatriz Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f6f231538de608f15064","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yulia Van Der Bom","original_name":"Yulia Van Der Bom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f6fc31538de608f15072","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nuria Martínez","original_name":"Nuria Martínez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f70e790d78633a010eb2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paz Carbajosa","original_name":"Paz Carbajosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f71813d0e96b427b96fa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iratxe Marian","original_name":"Iratxe Marian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f721790d78633a010ecc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorleta Padilla","original_name":"Dorleta Padilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f72c13d0e96b427b9718","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaisa Domínguez","original_name":"Yaisa Domínguez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4f734790d78633a010ed6","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4035681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Gómez","original_name":"Marta Gómez","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d2d9bf76a9d73467812e6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4198427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Iglesias","original_name":"Paula Iglesias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d2d9c866892bad6281b118","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTBWvNRECAyaiFYfXhhXDLcPRdA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/1YAjc2YJJfuWp4Lfatrwt9AceN6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
