Stunningly restored by Tammer to a pristine high defintion, this is a heartfelt and exquisite film, honouring the existence of the people we see on screen, even if no-one (including Tammer) now knows who they are. A film one watches with awe and wonder.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/d54yE6c57ClzLQoDx1Weghbdjfg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trip of a Lifetime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Tammer","original_name":"Peter Tammer","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/33pteOyveurarR3wvVrqTLvn6KI.jpg","credit_id":"67d13d3cb5ee0e397c60c397","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d54yE6c57ClzLQoDx1Weghbdjfg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
