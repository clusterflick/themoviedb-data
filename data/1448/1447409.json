We all belong to a place, but that place doesn't belong to us. This is the conclusion reached by actor Alex O'Dogherty, as he continues the research his father began into the history of his surname. Not all descendants of immigrants are treated equally. It depends on where they come from and the color of their skin. Alex tries to find out who he is, searching for where he comes from, only to discover that he's from... a little bit of everywhere.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/h8NyYNjo9S5TDvnEJaMH6vYA8k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Bit From Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álex O'Dogherty","original_name":"Álex O'Dogherty","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/asQRtN7bEnf82IGE6GBmo5htXAS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"67d1eaf6434c98c8ec818a2d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álex O'Dogherty","original_name":"Álex O'Dogherty","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/asQRtN7bEnf82IGE6GBmo5htXAS.jpg","credit_id":"67d1eb1764443984b11e0ecb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álex O'Dogherty","original_name":"Álex O'Dogherty","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/asQRtN7bEnf82IGE6GBmo5htXAS.jpg","credit_id":"67d1eb20434c98c8ec818a42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3168014,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Iván Karras","original_name":"Iván Karras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d1eb2c434c98c8ec818a49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1522,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h8NyYNjo9S5TDvnEJaMH6vYA8k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
