Britain's indie darlings took to the outdoors to play feel-good classics hand-picked from their six albums, including 'Always Like This', 'Luna', 'Meditate', 'Shuffle', and 'Eat, Sleep, Wake'. Jack Steadman, Jamie MacColl, Suren de Saram, and Ed Nash blend folk, electronica, and world music with their signature indie rock style throughout their upbeat 20-song set. Then, in an atmospheric twist, the band welcomed guest stars Rae Morris and Nilüfer Yanya to deliver an unforgettable experience against the London skyline.","popularity":0.1226,"poster_path":"/uR7GeS3YifNipr7JJaZ1k3v4jcI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256301,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Air","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bombay Bicycle Club deliver a euphoric 90-minute set at Alexandra Palace Park.
