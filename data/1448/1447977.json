She uses her work to escape the reality of her fractious marriage to Edward, whose behaviour has become erratic under pressure from his failing business. Unexpectedly, Angie's estranged mother dies. Inflamed by her death, Angie's sister, Molly, makes an explosive revelation about the sisters' family past, conjuring up memories of a childhood trauma that torment Angie's mind and invade her illustrations. Her real and fictional worlds ominously fuse and come alive in the nightmarish woods of her horrific childhood. It's up to her creative mind to release her from her damning past.","popularity":0.1082,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":107281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Dawnay","original_name":"Sophia Dawnay","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67d3267441ca4f51433e078c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":40686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin McGlade","original_name":"Martin McGlade","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67d32687dd12ee38607f4cff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Callan","original_name":"Barry Callan","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67d3268fdd12ee38607f4d03","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3211763,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Ian Sciacaluga","original_name":"Ian Sciacaluga","popularity":0.1294,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3264041ca4f51433e0774","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5302605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Williamson","original_name":"Jonathan Williamson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3265b05df3cdbdc7f4c7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11434392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
