He left Huaraz on horseback, a donkey carrying his equipment. While crossing Cajas, the last village on the trail to Lake Paron, he was greeted by Victor and Cesar, two Indians who accompanied him to the lake. The climb to the summit was tiring, requiring as much effort from his arms as from his legs. The beginning of the descent was hesitant, the slope extremely steep. He achieved his feat on June 9, his thirty-second birthday.","popularity":0.1043,"poster_path":"/u49mTzXXUODXgeIsgrsbACzsoro.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256008,"logo_path":"/sftzUQEsYAwLzrUBQz8AIMyZShp.png","name":"Alpha Films & Vidéo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Gringo Eskiador","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3834204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Vallençant","original_name":"Patrick Vallençant","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/5vfELUthyoDbuT6DA4yX1NMSsrR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d11a8313990a058b60aa0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5298963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Saloff-Coste","original_name":"Pierre Saloff-Coste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d11a8c27c3960c2d1e16ae","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5298963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Saloff-Coste","original_name":"Pierre Saloff-Coste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d11a7627c3960c2d1e169c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298966,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thérèse Andersson-Fournier","original_name":"Thérèse Andersson-Fournier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d11b4966892bad62815109","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298968,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre-Jean Croset","original_name":"Pierre-Jean Croset","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d11b65b5ee0e397c60bb25","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f8SYLCbsqcDvSbCeNRjgDpF0KBx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u49mTzXXUODXgeIsgrsbACzsoro.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":"zu","file_path":"/cciksTFLzk3WuhLYpVUMaWcgdjr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":191724,"name":"andes mountains"},{"id":284089,"name":"extreme skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
