Dream Travel and Travel Dream are designed to be shown together.  McElwee is an alchemist, transforming footage — from ancient architectural monuments, nature and contemporary structures — into imaginative movements that bring the viewer to recognize the temporal nature of all we consider sacred. In a dream-like sequence with ethereal musical accompaniment, figures move slowly around both familiar and mysterious spaces. McElwee masterfully brings universal themes — life and death, sublimity and cruelty, beauty and tragedy — to new depths in relation with all that is.\r Dickson Beall, Webster-Kirkwood Times,","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yE8Ivn75Knh0xTYLx9O2xGfDeIb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travel Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d1ccdaa1f36ecddc1dcddc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yE8Ivn75Knh0xTYLx9O2xGfDeIb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
