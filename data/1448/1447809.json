The collective sweeps of the neon stage with a revival of rarely performed songs such as 'Six Feet Under The Stars', 'Damned if I Do Ya, Damned if I Don't', and 'Remembering Sunday', alongside fan-favorites 'Dear Maria, Count Me In' and 'Therapy'. These, combined with silver confetti, explosive pyrotechnics, and epic strobe lights, created a nostalgic wave of singing and dancing from thousands of fans.
