Starting with the familiar premise of the absent woman, so popular with Downtown filmmakers, Vogl drains his storytelling of any hints of noir stylization. Instead of nighttime scenes, slick streets, and dark alleys, he shoots documentary-style on the nondescript, sunlit streets of Brooklyn, Manhattan, and City Island in a manner that casually references the art-film angst of Michelangelo Antonioni.","popularity":0.2587,"poster_path":"/3c4UhdLeGRuihhSNpIVW6tHAoSE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patti Astor","original_name":"Patti Astor","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/Ava3mV28ZghQI93UEyg6omIABtb.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a486f580e0a26489d00d030","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Mitchell","original_name":"Eric Mitchell","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/fhRZwRTI2lwl1x7qlFzG5IZyPkU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a486f620e0a26489a00d3ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Cortez","original_name":"Diego Cortez","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a4870190e0a26488f00d5be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Garrett Jr.","original_name":"Earl Garrett Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a487029925141031700bc44","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a487031c3a36818ff00c35b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Indiana","original_name":"Gary Indiana","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/399dMqyNxhNC0df56vQx59IG0Kl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a48703b925141031d00bf67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raoul Mignuchi","original_name":"Raoul Mignuchi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a48704ac3a368190300c884","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Audiello","original_name":"Massimo Audiello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a4870bb0e0a26489500cb65","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Enslin","original_name":"Susan Enslin","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a487104925141031400bca5","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1664932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harald Vogl","original_name":"Harald Vogl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a4870d80e0a26489800ce2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1889,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3c4UhdLeGRuihhSNpIVW6tHAoSE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1259}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207268,"name":"neo-noir"},{"id":209480,"name":"no wave"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
