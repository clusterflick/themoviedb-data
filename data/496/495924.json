In this investigation, scientists embark in search of the micro-plastics. Small, mostly invisible, toxic, they are home to the new ecosystem:  the plastisphere. But where are they? Ingested by organisms? Buried under the ocean floor? Degraded by bacteria? And what is the impact of them entering the food chain?","popularity":0.0797,"poster_path":"/rqCOf4YDqXQQeFMvpFy1pi2juHj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Via Découvertes","origin_country":""},{"id":13542,"logo_path":"/sJ0R9LDMGR5ildYS4GMhQcbKJVD.png","name":"CNRS Images","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":206135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tara Expéditions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"99% of the plastic that should be floating in the oceans is missing.
