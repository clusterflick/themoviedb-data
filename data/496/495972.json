Forget what you have heard before (most of that is rumors anyway) and ride with Billy the Kid as he tries to find sanctuary in a desperate landscape. The high price on his head has made Billy an evasive target for bounty hunters from all over the old west, and Billy knows that every time he rides out, he has a chance of getting bushwhacked. Unlike any other account of the Billy the Kid saga, \"The Last Days of Billy the Kid\" captures the fury, paranoia and heartbreak that defined the last days of the gunslinger's existence.","popularity":0.2102,"poster_path":"/lIji3IiJwQIMzwTBAU0t2otX3zy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Old West's Most Iconic Outlaw","title":"The Last Days of Billy the Kid","video":false,"vote_average":2.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1681763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Adams","original_name":"William Adams","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Watson","credit_id":"5a4c278f9251415a470019b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1678909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jezibell Anat","original_name":"Jezibell Anat","popularity":0.1605,"profile_path":"/oeElnRQ5GItH0nA0YOj3i24y9nQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"One-Eyed Lily","credit_id":"5a4c27a8c3a36838e50017af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1952606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Brahim","original_name":"Daniel Brahim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ernie the Bartender","credit_id":"5a4c27bf9251415a53001924","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1952607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Cash","original_name":"Jason Cash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Billy the Kid","credit_id":"5a4c27d59251415a470019fa","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1678909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jezibell Anat","original_name":"Jezibell Anat","popularity":0.1605,"profile_path":"/oeElnRQ5GItH0nA0YOj3i24y9nQ.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0d59dc3a3682d4b01ec0e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Forbes","original_name":"Christopher Forbes","popularity":0.3129,"profile_path":"/b4bSvw9Yvjh7CEOi5CXaxY1pOz1.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0d5c20e0a266e6b01c7c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Alson","original_name":"Stuart Alson","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/oqeOAcZkqiVl1BWWiDhdJ4Tx5hH.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0d61092514179b601bc1c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Forbes","original_name":"Christopher Forbes","popularity":0.3129,"profile_path":"/b4bSvw9Yvjh7CEOi5CXaxY1pOz1.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0d5870e0a266e5b01c161","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Forbes","original_name":"Christopher Forbes","popularity":0.3129,"profile_path":"/b4bSvw9Yvjh7CEOi5CXaxY1pOz1.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0d595c3a3682d4b01ec03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Forbes","original_name":"Christopher Forbes","popularity":0.3129,"profile_path":"/b4bSvw9Yvjh7CEOi5CXaxY1pOz1.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0d5b792514179c101aa25","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Forbes","original_name":"Christopher Forbes","popularity":0.3129,"profile_path":"/b4bSvw9Yvjh7CEOi5CXaxY1pOz1.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0d6060e0a266e5701cd69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7339930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lIji3IiJwQIMzwTBAU0t2otX3zy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/snRJEmWNtPKkkwbGnSnFl2mn3kP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
