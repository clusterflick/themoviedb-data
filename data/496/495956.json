Fans of the long-running Western series will appreciate the archival care that went into this set: Not only does it provide a comprehensive overview of the series' evolution (from original radio shows to one-hour color episodes from the 1960s and '70s), but it also delivers a priceless abundance of oral TV history in the form of audio commentaries, some recorded by series stars and directors (like Dennis Weaver, a.k.a. \"Chester\") shortly before their death.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":585,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gunsmoke: The Directors Collection","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
