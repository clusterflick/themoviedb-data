Complex patterns of stereotyping and other projections of identity emerge through the participants’ discussions; authority is questioned, assumed, and taken away; and viewers are implicated as the participants become aware of subjective forces that exist beyond the imposed boundaries of the conference system.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/vJm6eKdkGTndscKM14kx5VJ5WaH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Task","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279866,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Saia","original_name":"Michael Saia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3b5c3aa7898007fe51c68","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1534685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leigh Ledare","original_name":"Leigh Ledare","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a477b26c3a368095200afc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10927766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vJm6eKdkGTndscKM14kx5VJ5WaH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Chicago, Illinois","release_date":"2017-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
