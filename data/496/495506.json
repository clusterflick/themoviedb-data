Dekeukeleire transformed him into a butcher who commits an act of rebellion during a political demonstration at the foot of the Yser Tower (with authentic images of the 1930 meeting) which is being suppressed brutally by the authorities. White Flame secretes a drifting air of unreality straight out of Bu√±uel, born out of 'carnal' close-ups and an editing style which owes a great deal to Soviet films of that period.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/nwf2hiP1drvFgp8C5MnD4sdcJQd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101896,"logo_path":null,"name":"PDK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1930-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Flame","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willem Rombauts","original_name":"Willem Rombauts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a488cf00e0a26488c00e93b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willem Rombauts","original_name":"Willem Rombauts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a488d72c3a368193800c455","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Dekeukeleire","original_name":"Charles Dekeukeleire","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/mKfnPAMH1qiD9ygHosiWy6JAday.jpg","credit_id":"5a488cfc0e0a26489200dcce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0230977","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nwf2hiP1drvFgp8C5MnD4sdcJQd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
