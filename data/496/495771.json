Produced in 1994 by filmmakers Fredrick Armstrong and James P. Harte, the forty-five minute  documentary recounts the tale of an American city's bumpy ride through the Twentieth  Century, from the perspective of a little engine that could, but didn't.  The film has since been rereleased (2005) and now contains the main feature with special portions that were added as part of the rereleased version.  These include a look at the only surviving subway car from the lines and a Phantom tun through the tunnels in their abandoned state, among others, for a total of 90 minutes of unique and well preserved historical information.","popularity":0.7833,"poster_path":"/p6f46Utkk9zQW4ZELfZpmd388sB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99174,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animatus Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":99175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Post Central, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of the smallest city in America to build and abandon a subway","title":"The End Of The Line: Rochester's Subway","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rochester Subway","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rochester Subway Documentary","type":"AKA"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Walter Dixon","original_name":"Walter Dixon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a4ae52a9251415c8f01c044","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Vedder","original_name":"Arthur Vedder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":43,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5a4ae7bb9251415c9e01cf87","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Livy Richard","original_name":"Livy Richard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":44,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5a4ae7dc0e0a262db901e4cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas D'Ettorre","original_name":"Thomas D'Ettorre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":45,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5a4ae7ee9251415ca401c20e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Senator George Argetsinger","original_name":"Senator George Argetsinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":46,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5a4ae808c3a36805df01e0d0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold S.W.
