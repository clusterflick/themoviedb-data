As their narratives unfold, they are beautifully interwoven with the legacy of Eleanore and her family, whose life, untimely death, and the impact of her wheelchair ignited a powerful movement of hope for countless children and their families facing similar challenges. This film is not just a story of perseverance and love; it is a testament to the strength of community, brought to life through the collaborative efforts of volunteers, students, and communities across Peru and the United States, embodying a true grassroots style of storytelling that resonates with authenticity and compassion.","popularity":0.3832,"poster_path":"/u5yOn5QrMdbtDhOmYWEtdFltEWP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nonprofit Film Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary about disability, perseverance, and the story of a girl and her wheelchair.","title":"letters to eleanore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","title":"cartas a eleanore","type":"Spanish"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194026,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tamara Kittelson","original_name":"Tamara Kittelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f9680e93bd071355b35d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Candela","original_name":"Sandra Candela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f9697f3ba018b71f083bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Ficker","original_name":"Lisa Ficker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f96ace702d866595b3ac0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Miklautsch","original_name":"Laura Miklautsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f96c101a71aca54f08807","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanore Kittelson-Aldred","original_name":"Eleanore Kittelson-Aldred","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f96cfe1af20590faab9fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Antonio Patron Quispe","original_name":"Jose Antonio Patron Quispe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f96dee1af20590faaba08","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trish Toole","original_name":"Trish Toole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f96ec01a71aca54f08826","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Marie Tschida","original_name":"Anna Marie Tschida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f96fa01a71aca54f0883c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Valentine","original_name":"Scott Valentine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678f970be93bd071355b3608","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194027,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"T.
