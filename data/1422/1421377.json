The movie journeys down the mighty Colorado River, examining the astonishing beauty and biodiversity of the region, while confronting the environmental destruction from dams and the perilous fate of the river.  The story is told through never-before-seen wildlife sequences such as beavers building wetlands, condors recovering from the brink, and the potential return of Jaguars to American soil.  The film beautifully advocates for better management of the river and increased wildlife conservation efforts in the iconic landscapes of The American Southwest.","popularity":0.2004,"poster_path":"/4EAl7y4cyJn3IsQ4ZQGTsz0QXiD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American Southwest: A River Ran Through It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Masters","original_name":"Ben Masters","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/7IVrvFC8fTlQqQuFKCDKjVaz9VG.jpg","credit_id":"679000b82f2aa5c158aac744","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3654569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katy Baldock","original_name":"Katy Baldock","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/bF2eZ0qhI99Rkw98RiXDmUKQXxt.jpg","credit_id":"679000c52f2aa5c158aac75e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3344265,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Len Necefer","original_name":"Len Necefer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679000d3f87f4119e6aac4bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3654679,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ryan Olinger","original_name":"Ryan Olinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679000dfb4ef11284ff08fce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4EAl7y4cyJn3IsQ4ZQGTsz0QXiD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
