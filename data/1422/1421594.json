Twenty-seven years ago, he disappeared without a trace, and ever since, he has been on the international most wanted list. Now, Karin af Klintberg searches for him to find out how he lives and where he's been hiding all these years. But perhaps above all, to uncover what everyone is wondering: Was he guilty? Through new and opposing testimonies from never-before-heard voices, Karin simultaneously continues the search for the truth about the coup. How could five people swindle 600 million kr and still go free? And where did the money actually go?","popularity":0.3991,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94274,"logo_path":"/zr8bp7lgzFZOjFQqUHeYto7nDdf.png","name":"Nexiko","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Trustor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karin af Klintberg","original_name":"Karin af Klintberg","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/zlezBtScRVxQt4wFfNQuZaldOdR.jpg","credit_id":"6790a6b3c9115c9e3d28addf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365346,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Teresa Alldén","original_name":"Teresa Alldén","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790a6cabe9a9aa78277532e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884212,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Berggren Eyre","original_name":"Lisa Berggren Eyre","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790a6d8c9115c9e3d28ae13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5072334","wikidata_id":"Q130472946","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6285,"name":"coup d'etat"},{"id":10051,"name":"heist"},{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"},{"id":210608,"name":"1990s"},{"id":307587,"name":"crime documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
