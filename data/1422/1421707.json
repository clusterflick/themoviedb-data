The wooden dolls she carves so beautifully catch the eye of a group of artists who are having a picnic in the area. Among them is aspiring opera singer Ricardo Fitzmaurice. Rosemary is convinced to move to New York City where she becomes wildly successful, but when the temperamental Madame Fedoreska, who is in love with Ricardo, becomes insanely jealous of his growing affection for Rosemary she threatens to kill her. When Madame turns up shot to death, the police look at Rosemary as a suspect--and even worse, she has no alibi.","popularity":0.131,"poster_path":"/uw7WHOiNUhO6p93qkMQBWR8XNSn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7486,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosemary Climbs the Heights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rosemary Van Voort","credit_id":"6790e668bca8037dab28b2be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Forrest","original_name":"Allan Forrest","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/jhGHhMlLlprXT3VBQuvVHFw9Ht1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ricardo Fitzmaurice","credit_id":"6790e671a7f27130bb28b367","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2008683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Shelby","original_name":"Margaret Shelby","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/wYjPU9pRrntpBHxK8Fbf3Qh8hS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Wanda Held","credit_id":"6790e67bfc2519b43f775bd9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Mineau","original_name":"Charlotte Mineau","popularity":0.1449,"profile_path":"/642NC8cEQYHWq383qiotTjXwC19.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mme.
