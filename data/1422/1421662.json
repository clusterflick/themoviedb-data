This made life  even more difficult for the lowest-level performers, the extras. The story begins with Kehan Zhang, a man who loves acting and works as a full-time extra. He had been working as an extra for three years and paid NTD 500 in cash every time. His daily routine includes searching for various audition opportunities, submitting resumes, and only receiving audition notices every now and then. To fulfill the dream of becoming a leading actor, he decided to venture into the film and television industry in China and started his Don Quixote journey with pals. The documentary also films other actors and actresses - the girl from the south and Brother Long, and how they experienced gender and age limitations in the industry. Besides the stereotypes in the industry, they also faced challenges balancing work and family.","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":"/gz4vfLxHHUqu9G245tqmYTzEPks.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2025-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extra's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4421334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shih Sheng-lung","original_name":"SHIH Sheng-lung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/e4n10mjzZ7YGrp1BlcbTo5FJgrL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67a5c4d0470bb75ff26700ea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4025999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hsin-Yu Wu","original_name":"伍心瑜","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790cb47a7f27130bb28ae92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584835,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tsung-hsien Wu","original_name":"Tsung-hsien Wu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790ccabbe9a9aa7827756bb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4025999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hsin-Yu Wu","original_name":"伍心瑜","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790ccb9550e6fc3cddff669","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865033,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Blaire Ko","original_name":"Blaire Ko","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/f4wniTstaOR5Lm5kpXzZFA2MWvG.jpg","credit_id":"6790ccc2550e6fc3cddff67b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28149538","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"theextrasjourney","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2122,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/gz4vfLxHHUqu9G245tqmYTzEPks.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taipei International Labor Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
