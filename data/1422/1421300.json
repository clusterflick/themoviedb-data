John gives Jim, his lover, a medallion as an anniversary gift. But all hell breaks loose—literally—when the medallion causes Jim to become possessed by a sex demon and wreak havoc on New York's gay cruising spots. Never released on home video, J. C. Cricket's SEX DEMON is a crucial piece of queer horror history that has been preserved from a 16mm release print. Plus: The XXX-rated hauntings continue with DEADLY BLOWS and 10:30 P.M. MONDAY—two formerly lost horror films that also make their uncut home video debuts. In the words of GAY SCENE critic Bruce King: “The squeamish may not want to watch . . . but if you do, you won’t forget!”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"... not even an exorcist could help","title":"Sex Demon and Other Hauntings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
