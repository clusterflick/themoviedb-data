He is a young seaman from Rauma, Finland, whose fate was to be swallowed by the waves of the Atlantic Ocean as the only fatality of the shipwreck of his vessel, the M/S Mercur, on 8 December, 1925.  Milja Viita’s collage film combines primary source material such as letters and logbooks with archival film footage shot between the 1960s and the 1990s. The authentic footage lets us have a glimpse into the day-to-day life of seafarers far from their home ports.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/biptmASb3KQXEa7mel7kLsoHWZB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2025-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seafarers – A Tale Of A Young Sailor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milja Viita","original_name":"Milja Viita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790e25a3479c48ccb28bbb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milja Viita","original_name":"Milja Viita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790e2b02a7aff0c3b28b321","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36131218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1969,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/biptmASb3KQXEa7mel7kLsoHWZB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1313}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocPoint - Helsinki Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
