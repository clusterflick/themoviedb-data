Once abundant across Central Africa, this keystone species has been decimated by poaching. Wander Alone tells the story of the last survivors as they live out their final days under constant armed protection at Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy. The rhinos' daily routines are sensitively documented in a series of vignettes that capture the intimate last moments of a dying species. The film blends insights from biology, psychology, anthropology and philosophy into a meditation on extinction, loneliness and the fragility of life on Earth. Through the rhinos’ decline we bear witness to the consequences of human exceptionalism and hubris and to the alarming material outcomes of our relentless industrial expansion.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5aMRyFBXdHsVsWxDa9Yu66odTr4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wander Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joey Bania","original_name":"Joey Bania","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679002e42ef5be0b9c5b50f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Mott","original_name":"Justin Mott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679002f27718d1e898aac45f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Mott","original_name":"Justin Mott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679002fc2ef5be0b9c5b5110","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5194882,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Quynh Anh Mott","original_name":"Quynh Anh Mott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679003132f2aa5c158aac8b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5aMRyFBXdHsVsWxDa9Yu66odTr4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
