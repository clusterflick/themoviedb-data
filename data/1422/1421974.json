When the townspeople brought in a theater company in 1966 to bolster the dwindling economy, they opened its doors to all manner of folk and progressive ideas. This is not quite what they had intended. Almost 60 years later, with these two worlds living side by side, Creede is a taut microcosm of current national divisions. Guns in classrooms? Pronouns, what now? Weaving intimate storylines of its nuanced residents, tense debates at town meetings and forays into its rich history, Creede U.S.A. offers a hopeful, humanistic and urgent glimpse at a community that must continually negotiate its common ground.","popularity":0.2419,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creede U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1230207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kahane Cooperman","original_name":"Kahane Cooperman","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679151fcba46990f54e0094b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jennifer Pelling","original_name":"Jennifer Pelling","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6HGhlTo9wEfaT7k2aDJFZ6wtpRo.jpg","credit_id":"679152073479c48ccb28da0d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3824662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Stolte","original_name":"Chris Stolte","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67915210d8100c6d79e00728","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3824663,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heidi Stolte","original_name":"Heidi Stolte","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679152163479c48ccb28da10","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chandra Jessee","original_name":"Chandra Jessee","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67915220be9a9aa782776ae8","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Lichtenfeld","original_name":"Rebecca Lichtenfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67915229ba46990f54e00960","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3284225,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monika Parekh","original_name":"Monika Parekh","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67915230be9a9aa782776aec","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1265275,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Innbo Shim","original_name":"Innbo Shim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6791523fd8100c6d79e00746","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495090,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Saunderson","original_name":"Andrew Saunderson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6791524ca7f27130bb28c054","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1230207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kahane Cooperman","original_name":"Kahane Cooperman","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67915254be9a9aa782776b14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon Kilmurry","original_name":"Simon Kilmurry","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67915262d8100c6d79e00758","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668626,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Kenney","original_name":"Peter Kenney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67915271be9a9aa782776b2f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
