Congo) and the hills and mountains surrounding Fungurume form one of the world’s largest copper and cobalt deposits. In pre-colonial times the area was already a major centre in the copper trading network that ran across Central Africa. Today the mountains have become the property of the American Tenke Fungurume Mining consortium (TFM). From 2009 onward, TFM’s mining activities have been in full swing, causing the resettlement of thousands of local Sanga inhabitants. Pungulume focuses on Sanga chief Mpala and his court elders while they are rendering the oral history of the Sanga people, against the backdrop of the industrial destruction of the landscape that anchors Sanga memory and identity.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53178,"logo_path":"/dh9hl8PXWcmpToXP9HsTLqHswlT.png","name":"Auguste Orts","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sango","iso_639_1":"sg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pungulume","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sammy Baloji","original_name":"Sammy Baloji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67903b6c2d61c33e63dfe504","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sammy Baloji","original_name":"Sammy Baloji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67903d69be9a9aa7827740ba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip De Boeck","original_name":"Filip De Boeck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67903d8aa7f27130bb289fa5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2898047,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sébastien Demeffe","original_name":"Sébastien Demeffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67903da8a7f27130bb289fb6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5195289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frédéric Furnelle","original_name":"Frédéric Furnelle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67903dc8a7f27130bb289fd1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip De Boeck","original_name":"Filip De Boeck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67903dfabe9a9aa782774117","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
