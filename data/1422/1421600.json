The story takes place in 1910 and is about Bastiaan de Geer (Jos Brink) who, in order to impress Miss Mariëtte van Heusden Hurgonje, tells everyone that he is of noble descent, reluctantly helped by his friend, couturier Sandor Petri (Frank Sanders). Because Bastiaan's mother is actually a housekeeper for Sandor Petri, Bastiaan disguises himself as Dowager de Geer in order to keep up appearances for Mariëtte. The masquerade is further intensified and Bastiaan is forced to also pretend to be an ex-resident of the Indies and as his own butler.","popularity":0.1564,"poster_path":"/jZjnICR3iRMZLrINfXRnMVC6D2l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tekstpierement
