Eventually he finds a job at a school in a small coastal town teaching a bunch of misfit kids how to play cricket. We are first introduced to Ricky, the new kid, who has been expelled from schools because of his short temper. Ricky tries to stay out of trouble but with his newfound friends he lands up in the Principles office more once. As punishment the boys are forced to play cricket after school with Mr Shannyn, who finds it disgraceful that his game of cricket is nothing more than detention.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2017-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Kings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Strydom","original_name":"Justin Strydom","popularity":0.4645,"profile_path":"/eSsrFy98hyeAvzTIAxNp8iSdX0h.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6489daa129383500aeef2021","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4111566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Taylor","original_name":"Jonathan Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6489dad199259c00accf26e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":62694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa-Marie Schneider","original_name":"Lisa-Marie Schneider","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6489dad9e375c000e251c448","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darrell James Roodt","original_name":"Darrell James Roodt","popularity":0.2406,"profile_path":"/iJ0oqs5Il1B6hEV2A1FLmTYeMXz.jpg","credit_id":"6489dae56f8d95011f245388","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4111568,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Dicason","original_name":"Mark Dicason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6489daeed2b209010c1baa73","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anton Ernst","original_name":"Anton Ernst","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6489dafbe375c000ff4aca3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4111569,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Toby Harris","original_name":"Toby Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6489db1fe375c000ff4aca55","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4111571,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lee-Anne Theron","original_name":"Lee-Anne Theron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6489db2e99259c00e2f77717","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13551250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
