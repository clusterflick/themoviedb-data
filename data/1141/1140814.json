She tests positive and a preventive mastectomy is recommended. Her best friend, Hannelie, and her caring fianc√©, Daniel, try to support her, but the interaction with them upsets her. In Eva's world, breasts are associated with sexuality, breastfeeding and attractiveness. What will be left of it after the operation? She begins to avoid the subject and prefers to live in denial. However, a poetry festival is approaching where Eva will be in the spotlight. Maybe she waited too long to make a decision?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volle Bors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
