And then genetic imprinting, i.e., handicaps of some kind, and show how children behave in a class situation in that case. But some facts about LSD are included and some voices that happen to be me and another person talking about the effects of it and they are combined with images of that kind, from therapeutic experiments at a mental hospital. For a long time it remains on a kind of immobile, introverted plane with different levels of consciousness, and then there is the breakout, that is the outwardly activating insight, the story of the crown prince and the draft.\" (Fahlström)","popularity":0.1486,"poster_path":"/hXksrgCjciifVkP7IRyAnysRU9P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"U-barn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Öyvind Fahlström","original_name":"Öyvind Fahlström","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64892da4e375c000c529f9a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434354,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Olle Holm","original_name":"Olle Holm","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64892f46e375c000acc75b56","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andreas Bellis","original_name":"Andreas Bellis","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64892f5fbf31f2505f407dcc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4110774,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Davis","original_name":"Peter Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64892f9999259c01392d5e06","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per Berglund","original_name":"Per Berglund","popularity":0.1406,"profile_path":"/fgAxzVq7dOmsYG40Sm2BB9rQ3kz.jpg","credit_id":"64892fb9e27260010724424f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4110775,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommy Lundkvist","original_name":"Tommy Lundkvist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64892fce6f8d95011f23ef5d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Jarl","original_name":"Stefan Jarl","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/kUOIY0n19wK9lTxnwkDDUEBCJMc.jpg","credit_id":"64892feb6f8d95011f23ef78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hXksrgCjciifVkP7IRyAnysRU9P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
