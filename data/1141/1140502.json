Leading the fight was Olof Palmes' Swedish Government, which covertly funneled over US$ 1 billion to the resistance movement. This money was given without the knowledge of either the Parliament or the Swedish populace. At the center of the net in South Africa was a Swedish diplomat called Birgitta Karlström Dorph. Meanwhile at the UN the Swedes with their Scandinavian counterparts attempted to win the argument for economic sanctions. This led to bitter arguments which saw Palme leading the fight against the Reagan and Thatcher administrations.","popularity":0.3082,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sweden's war against apartheid","title":"Palme's Secret Agent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4113864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgitta Karlström Dorph","original_name":"Birgitta Karlström Dorph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"648b62aac2ff3d011cb7f120","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Pauser","original_name":"Erik Pauser","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b6196c2ff3d00c59892c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Williams","original_name":"Dylan Williams","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b621842bf0100c7fa0e13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4113840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bengt Nilsson","original_name":"Bengt Nilsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b6181c3c891014ebc34c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4113853,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew D'Arcy","original_name":"Matthew D'Arcy","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b6251c2ff3d00ffb9c02d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Williams","original_name":"Dylan Williams","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b61d342bf0100c7fa0e07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Pauser","original_name":"Erik Pauser","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b61ee263462010cba72b1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4113853,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew D'Arcy","original_name":"Matthew D'Arcy","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b6235c3c89100cad8eaab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4113862,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fredrik Wassermeyer","original_name":"Fredrik Wassermeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b626c559d220139bc0f0d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Pauser","original_name":"Erik Pauser","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b6204c3c891014ebc34ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4113862,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fredrik Wassermeyer","original_name":"Fredrik Wassermeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b627ac3c89100ae4f8bcc","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4113840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bengt Nilsson","original_name":"Bengt Nilsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b629a42bf0100ae2ff53e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8412138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1192,"name":"sweden"},{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":4106,"name":"apartheid"},{"id":198429,"name":"anti-apartheid"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":293259,"name":"swedish history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Palmes Secret Agent","key":"_4Ah8HCRcrQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-09-06T21:13:08.000Z","id":"648b612a559d22011c4ab91d"}]}}}
