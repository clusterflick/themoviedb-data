Within this wide landscape the film focuses on the destruction of the Jewish Muslim world that existed in North Africa, making it imaginable and inhabitable again. Narrated in the first person, by an Algerian Jew and a Palestinian Jew, the film refuses imperial histories of those places. Objects held captive in museums and archives outside of the places from where they were looted are only the visible tip of the iceberg of the mass colonial plunder of Africa. The film explores the substantial wealth accumulated through the extraction of raw materials, labour, knowledge and skills, including the “visual wealth” attained by putting people in front of the colonisers’ cameras.","popularity":0.208,"poster_path":"/ivCOiBcYYMMO9kAjbHDRw2I6IIZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The world like a jewel in the hand: unlearning imperial plunder ii","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4112920,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adel Ben Bella","original_name":"Adel Ben Bella","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b107042bf010101bcd190","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariela Aïsha Azoulay","original_name":"Ariela Aïsha Azoulay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b10b3076ce800ad720ab4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728933,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juna Suleiman","original_name":"Juna Suleiman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b1082559d22011c4a9c17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4112853,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bona Manga Bell","original_name":"Bona Manga Bell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b105ec2ff3d00ffb9a113","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariela Aïsha Azoulay","original_name":"Ariela Aïsha Azoulay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b10a5c2ff3d00ad006f8a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4112925,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadia Ammour","original_name":"Nadia Ammour","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b10de076ce800e742cd7e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4112850,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ziad Fayed","original_name":"Ziad Fayed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b1096c2ff3d00c59877f1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4112855,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eyal Vexler","original_name":"Eyal Vexler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648b108dc3c89100cad8cffd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1622,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ivCOiBcYYMMO9kAjbHDRw2I6IIZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1081}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":220343,"name":"diaspora"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
