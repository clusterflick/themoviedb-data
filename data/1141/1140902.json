The movie follows Lambodhar, a small time hustler and Con Artist who, in the course of perpetrating a malingering based con in a hospital, stumbles upon the corpse of a young woman named Gowri. Upon finding out that she was an orphan (just like him), then finding her diary in which she kept a sordid account of all the people who used her and drove her to die penniless in a government run hospital, Lambodhar resolves to avenge her. Not by inflicting violence, but by perpetrating a long distance long con, that nets him a lot of wealth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gowri Ganesha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
