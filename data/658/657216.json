She learned her song repertoire and singing style from her parents and villagers. She sang in the Rekova Church Choir in 1956, and has also been a member of the Rekava Ethnographic Ensemble from 1980. Her mother sang religious hymns ,\"godzinkas\", while Anna sang traditional dainas. The singing was like the rest of her life: in harmony with nature. Marked by hard work and deep religiosity, her songs are a kind of Eastern European blues or gospel. Singers like Anna Scemelinska are storytellers. Their folk songs comprise legends, history and experience from life.","popularity":0.0875,"poster_path":"/udmXDKiIexF38lVnQZb0olbBCIk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lauska","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2008-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teicēja Anna Ščemeļinska","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Folksinger Anna Scemelinska","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2487502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Scemelinska","original_name":"Anna Scemelinska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8FGHaSZzYLYd3IFwLiMFX7ShNpm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5dfe403ad1a8930019880304","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ontans Slisans","original_name":"Ontans Slisans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5dfe404bd236e600128c97ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarita Sakina","original_name":"Margarita Sakina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dfe406365686e001592a057","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aloizs Bukks","original_name":"Aloizs Bukks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dfe407c26dac100125f7f50","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otilija Supe","original_name":"Otilija Supe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dfe408e65686e001892bd81","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Vulfs","original_name":"Raitis Vulfs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfe40a426dac10017601cdc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487508,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ints Ivans","original_name":"Ints Ivans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfe40d626dac10014607d04","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487510,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eino Kolists","original_name":"Eino Kolists","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfe40f265686e00139374df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Vulfs","original_name":"Raitis Vulfs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfe40add1a8930019880392","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Vulfs","original_name":"Raitis Vulfs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfe40c026dac10017601cfe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Vulfs","original_name":"Raitis Vulfs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff0632bdfe31d003d57a3d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11475576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jihOOpeSqcA1HJlSTRRpLz1JEsk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/udmXDKiIexF38lVnQZb0olbBCIk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":178856,"name":"folklore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
