But just when she thought her new life would be the reset she needed, her self-centered boss, Martin, tasks Erin with finding homes for 12 puppies who were left behind after a photo shoot for his struggling GPS locator company - and all before Christmas. As they work together, Erin realizes Martin may not be so bad after all, and her take-charge attitude not only helps Martin save his company, but also reveals a calmer, better self that opens them both up to the idea of love.","popularity":1.0669,"poster_path":"/nH5NFwQAjLDoSaGQqnQ2gCchiSP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feifer
