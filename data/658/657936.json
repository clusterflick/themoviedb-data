In the show, Ed explores the thin line between righteous complaining and brat-like whining and asks, ‘are we right to be fed up, or are we spoiled?’ Ed is always happy to perform in Glasgow, where he took his fledgling comedy steps while at university. He set up his own club in the town and began to perfect his style and technique, which has gone on to earn him plenty of accolades.","popularity":0.2229,"poster_path":"/299ha1IronVD0PDXsYUGug4A3Eg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stramash Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ed Byrne: Spoiler Alert","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Byrne","original_name":"Ed Byrne","popularity":0.3936,"profile_path":"/4qoJeUpstjDwwrihVChx6JxQX9I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e02f61c0284200019b2f0f2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Byrne","original_name":"Ed Byrne","popularity":0.3936,"profile_path":"/4qoJeUpstjDwwrihVChx6JxQX9I.jpg","credit_id":"5e02f65fd1a89300149072ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2010714,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Bertellotti","original_name":"Paul Bertellotti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e02f685d1a8930012902e91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35342992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acKnye5fKTas2hEypdxpcxXX0KE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q2Y4n7jQykkdAMB4Mmm3Ddpgcox.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/299ha1IronVD0PDXsYUGug4A3Eg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1706},{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":2426,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j6Ka9RcbIKtGrWlVduQwlpzdG1c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1748}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"},{"id":176834,"name":"social media"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Scotland","release_date":"2019-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
