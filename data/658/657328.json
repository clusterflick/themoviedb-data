Be that as it may, she could not find it in her to drown the unwelcome visitor to the pantry, so she let it go and the silent little drama witnessed by the tramp greatly impressed him. Not so the strict aunt, she declared the whole thing to be in exact accordance with everything else in the family. Their hearts ran away with their heads. That was why they lost money on credit, could not pay off the mortgage and send the sick sister to a better climate. As for the tramp, they had no business to take him in. He could not pay for his keep. But the tramp surprised them all.","popularity":0.6298,"poster_path":"/512dh8h4vggjFhb1o8Hc4cab2vS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lady and the Mouse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The First Sister","credit_id":"5dfeca2d65686e001893aacc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Second Sister","credit_id":"5dfeca41d1a8930012881d5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Barrymore","original_name":"Lionel Barrymore","popularity":0.8391,"profile_path":"/ru11rLUzzLwKjR0ykTLkNIN9jcJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Father","credit_id":"5dfeca66d236e600108d9875","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Young Friend","credit_id":"5dfeca7f65686e001893ab4b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Toncray","original_name":"Kate Toncray","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/qb3ty4jC8UdZrvwjVHIilGjY4kr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Aunt","credit_id":"5dfecaa665686e00139474da","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
