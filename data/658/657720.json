From 1983 to 1986 the revolutionary EditDroid system was developed. The EditDroid was the first nonlinear electronic editing system and used several laser disc players loaded with the raw footage of a film. In the spring of 2005 Tom van Klingeren and Bruce Gray (both editors and instructors on filmmaking at the University of Amsterdam) went to Marin county in the United States in search of the lost history of the EditDroid. They visited the editors who had worked on the system in the 1980's and 90's. They made a return journey to the Skywalker Ranch with the now retired coordinator of the EditDroid project. At the ranch they explored the archives of Lucas' production company in search of the last EditDroid.","popularity":0.1027,"poster_path":"/aYhx9WFIly9JaifYSCa6LPpnCFc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Condor Postproduction","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EditDroid: Rise and Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51697,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edgar Burcksen","original_name":"Edgar Burcksen","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e017da926dac1001466b695","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":670,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Burtt","original_name":"Ben Burtt","popularity":0.8164,"profile_path":"/7asFDWjls2bYQSfXJf5StjXmlhI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e017db326dac100126560d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sinclair","original_name":"John Sinclair","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e017df975110d0018d96b3a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom van Klingeren","original_name":"Tom van Klingeren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e017e3326dac1001466b743","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489409,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tobias Corba","original_name":"Tobias Corba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e017e58d236e60016927b06","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489407,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Floor Jeuken","original_name":"Floor Jeuken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e017e260284200014b04ed1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489408,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Droog","original_name":"Robert Droog","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e017e4075110d0011d968ac","department":"Crew","job":"Post-Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489405,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manjit Kaur","original_name":"Manjit Kaur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e017e0e0284200016b04d22","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom van Klingeren","original_name":"Tom van Klingeren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e017e1b75110d0013d8df47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1536460","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aYhx9WFIly9JaifYSCa6LPpnCFc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
