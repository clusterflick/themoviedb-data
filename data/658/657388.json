But parents have to assert themselves, too. So how to behave? What to do if kids still don't respond after asking five times? In such situations, it is difficult to remain calm. Many parents find it difficult to bring up their children. In many everyday situations they lose patience, become loud or even use violence. The result of such escalations is crying children and frustrated parents who once again feel like failures. And they certainly don't want to talk about it. WEGE AUS DER BRÜLLFALLE shows these tricky everyday situations unfiltered and thus makes it easier for parents to start an open conversation about difficult parenting situations. This has already been achieved impressively in numerous previews.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dcvDyu9DQimEcTm3ZIjVLRf6ldb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wege aus der Brüllfalle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dcvDyu9DQimEcTm3ZIjVLRf6ldb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
