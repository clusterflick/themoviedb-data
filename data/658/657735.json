(Well, it’s a little more complicated than that…)  Davies’ play reveled in breaking the fourth wall: cameras and microphones are visible throughout and the play’s author/star himself even ends up a member of the audience.  Starmaker was a dry run for the themes of the Kinks’ 1975 album, The Kinks Present a Soap Opera.","popularity":0.1473,"poster_path":"/y5v3oXrLBH3slWxokvTEej7tV30.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starmaker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Davies","original_name":"Ray Davies","popularity":0.1198,"profile_path":"/wT4K58KkT2H3f9sWKBeJN6DL5qC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Star","credit_id":"5e01931075110d0011d9937e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Ritchie","original_name":"June Ritchie","popularity":0.1838,"profile_path":"/3oeO0pVObvvtoAkuZvKitgg73GY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"5e01931ed1a89300128d64a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Davies","original_name":"Dave Davies","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/eOlqjIb6gt0RKv5VIY7gqKY86TY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e019330d236e600109306df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":43864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Chapman","original_name":"Anne Chapman","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"60312b07b4a543003e11bf23","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gough","original_name":"Richard Gough","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"60312b55fab3fa003dfd7331","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Hennen","original_name":"Chris Hennen","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"60312b6a5c3247003edc423a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Plummer","original_name":"Peter Plummer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60312a891fb94f003f8c69ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695721,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ray Davies","original_name":"Ray Davies","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60312aa19af17100404370ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813100,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dennis Woolf","original_name":"Dennis Woolf","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60312ac4befb09003f8e63d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1095922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y5v3oXrLBH3slWxokvTEej7tV30.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rnxLutfNpgSarPRjEXG8UYUbuLX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
