The church musician Karl Richter (1926-1981)  founded the Munich Bach Orchestra and Bach Choir in the 1950s and thus put  into practice his new ideas of Bach interpretation. He departed from  oppressively large orchestral arrangements, introduced a new simplicity,  allowing the notes to turn directly into music. He kindled a blaze of  enthusiasm for Bach that goes on to this day. \"The Legacy of Karl Richter\"  documents the main milestones, events and people in the life of this great  artist and personality. It shows his roots in the Saxon-Thuringian musical  tradition and conveys something of the splendor of Karl Richter's  interpretations of Bach and Handel, which remain unsurpassed to this day.  Light is also shed upon the versatility of Richter's musical talent, which  ranged far beyond Bach and Handel.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9pHRfwK0HQf8qscLrO19lcN2Joe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legacy of Karl Richter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9pHRfwK0HQf8qscLrO19lcN2Joe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2006-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
