This video work consists of some footages I shot in the Kanggong Temple and near the Yang'e Food Market. By this simple video work, I want to explore the relationship among the religion, geography, and animals, especially the animals' traces and roles in the domain of beliefs. This video work was selected in the 2019 23rd Wusanto Film Festival in Taiwan.
