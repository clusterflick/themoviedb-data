On these road trips the two would shoot video of their surroundings using a portable video recorder. Some of these video recordings of the western mountain terrain were used to produce the televised video piece known as Program #7. Program #7 was produced as a part of a larger group of videos known as The Electronic Visualization Center: A Television Research Satellite to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Program #7 was televised on Chicago Public Television as a part of a program which ran work by independent video creators. Program #7 was created using a Sandin Image Processor and a Bally Home Computer. Graphics generated using a Bally Home Computer would be overlaid overtop of the video recorded by Veeder and Morton using the Sandin Image Processor. The Sandin Image Processor would also be used to add varying patterns to the image.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Program #7","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Veeder","original_name":"Jane Veeder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b46f294cd91200648a2255","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Morton","original_name":"Phil Morton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b46f0b1c6329004109e9fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
