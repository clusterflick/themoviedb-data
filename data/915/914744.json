The anonymous narrator of the film discusses her history of experiencing blackouts through drinking; covering a five-year time period that culminated in an entire three-day time-loss, her last bender. She also discusses levels of sobriety and her desire to continue to explore various recreational drugs. The narrator declares her intention to live her life alcohol-free, while simultaneously not wanting her identity to be defined through her problematic relationship with alcohol. The narrative is open, stark and direct: a dark insight, flecked with humor. Visually, the work stutters through black moments, punctuated by originally recorded, hand-processed 16mm color film, deploying multiple exposure and other in-camera, experimental techniques.","popularity":0.0528,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blackout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jordan Baseman's Blackout","type":"Exhibition Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Baseman","original_name":"Jordan Baseman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b589299f37b0009195ef59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5448670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
