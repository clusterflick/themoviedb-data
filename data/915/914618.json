Working alongside fearless wildlife crime investigators and covertly filming tiger traffickers, Aldo embarks on a perilous journey along key trafficking routes connecting Malaysia, China, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. He reveals how the breeding and farming of captive tigers drives consumer demand for tiger products and fuels the poaching of wild tigers. Aldo’s secretly filmed evidence is presented to international decision-makers at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in the hope that it will bring about change. With fewer than 4,000 tigers left in the wild, Aldo’s investigation also highlights the plight of a majestic species on the brink of extinction.","popularity":0.2598,"poster_path":"/nJI5CtTmIroer5fqiwYm5QWhqlu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tigers: Hunting the Traffickers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Kane","original_name":"Aldo Kane","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/eNBfAbXd6wuK15NNcoO34tja1z9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b50e00bd32090060eed817","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2130389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Warner","original_name":"Laura Warner","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b50e2c223e2000633e9895","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11916300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nJI5CtTmIroer5fqiwYm5QWhqlu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
