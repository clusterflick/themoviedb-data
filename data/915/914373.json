It is a myth, enacted through the avatar of a universal man, who samples this world from the cave to the beach to the parking lot to the supermarket, from birth to death, in navigation with other bodies, a figure of bounded perception whose actions are guided by impulse, invention, and perhaps, the stars. It is an embrace of life in its broadest definition, a catalogue of earthly phenomena. In this video, Relativity is discussed in relation to Emshwiller’s trajectory through the course of the 1950s and 60s, his interests in the body and abstraction, the correspondence between his work in science-fiction illustration and his work in experimental cinema, and the film’s mythopoeic constitution.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ysvOEBsuudaGOsMP9h1gAojk5ot.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scales of Being - Ed Emshwiller's Relativity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Broomer","original_name":"Stephen Broomer","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/5nu90x21hsMMeH2NQvS2dmfa96r.jpg","credit_id":"61b486eb1c6329001dbc7f5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ysvOEBsuudaGOsMP9h1gAojk5ot.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
