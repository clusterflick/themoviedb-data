Made for the United States Information Agency in 1977 by Academy Award winner Robert Snyder and Jaime Snyder, the film gives us a substantive look at Fuller and his work. It also contains a wonderfully intimate sequence with Fuller talking about his childhood. Buckminster Fuller was an architect, engineer, geometrician, philosopher, futurist, inventor of the famous geodesic dome, and one of the most brilliant thinkers of his time. His legacy becomes ever more relevant, providing us a road map to steer our planet away from oblivion and toward a sustainable future for all humanity. Fuller was renowned for his comprehensive perspective on the world's problems. For more than five decades he developed pioneering solutions reflecting his commitment to the potential of innovative design to \"do more with less\" and thereby improve human lives.","popularity":0.0877,"poster_path":"/fRbBvZnp3hmiuAfmJCPA1NfQW0Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reflections: R Buckminster Fuller","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2391618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaime Snyder","original_name":"Jaime Snyder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b58271d1857200449b9a39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Snyder","original_name":"Robert Snyder","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b58264bd3209001cb35c22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0243521","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fRbBvZnp3hmiuAfmJCPA1NfQW0Y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
