Рідна земля","overview":"The universe of Ukrainian village has always been one of the key topics for Oleksandr Koval. This film is his cinematic testament and, at the same time, a lyrical cinematic confession, which was filmed in his native village of Zherdova near Kyiv, where he was born and where he started his \"career in cinema\" as a cinema mechanic. This work is particularly illustrative with regard to Koval's tragic view of himself as a person who had to conceal his true self throughout his life.","popularity":0.1588,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home.
