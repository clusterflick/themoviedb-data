DisObey explores thinking around human rights, politics, activism, terrorism, youth crime and prevention, anti-social behavior, crime and deviance, social inclusion/exclusion, participation and representation. DisObey attempts to expand (and contract) definitions and interpretations of The Law. DisObey features Jason Warr, a criminologist from the University of Lincoln. Jason calls for a re-ordering of society: a recognition that we need to change our thinking and behavior radically in order to create a society that is truly fair and just for all. Jason also discusses his personal relationship with The Law as someone who has served 13 years in prison: Jason was imprisoned at the age of 17.","popularity":0.0939,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disobey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Baseman","original_name":"Jordan Baseman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4583821621b009c138bf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
