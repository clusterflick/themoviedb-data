This film is a lyrical portrait of the valley through the eyes of four characters who make their living from the land: a cider maker, a salmon fisherman, a sheep farmer and a beekeeper. It might seem idyllic, but when you live this close to nature a change in the weather can make all the difference between success and failure.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":"/5IN5ZW63DdJ9gLDCibygidO5Eon.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wye: Voices From the Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1745538","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":821,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5IN5ZW63DdJ9gLDCibygidO5Eon.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
