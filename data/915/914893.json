In the first part of this two-part mini-series, Colin explores corners of Cuba that few outsiders have seen. Amongst the wonders he encounters is the bee hummingbird, the world’s tiniest bird, found nowhere else on the planet, and the spectacle of thousands of crabs migrating en masse. Cuba’s isolation has helped preserve many of its natural riches, creating unspoiled landscapes that are home to many enchanting animals living under the bluest skies in the Caribbean. In this authored odyssey, the natural magic of one Earth’s most intriguing countries is revealed.","popularity":0.6548,"poster_path":"/vGoH0zfG7BRsSAhmX8MUPOp8V8l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Cuba: A Caribbean Journey","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Stafford-Johnson","original_name":"Colin Stafford-Johnson","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/cOqFmo9039YkOrm0t6msDi4mHdF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b5e2bdec455200602c6ce2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Murray","original_name":"John Murray","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/iRS3QM8np42qF3SBF11dgC2Xfig.jpg","credit_id":"61b5e2ea58efd3001b00dc7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11937228","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":783,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vGoH0zfG7BRsSAhmX8MUPOp8V8l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":262212,"name":"nature reserve"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
