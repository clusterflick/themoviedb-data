(1963). Done up in black lace lingerie, heavy makeup, and a seductive expression, he meanders across the room, methodically exposing different body parts, accentuated by cropped close-ups. Yet the work quickly deviates from standard realms of sexual fantasy, devolving into something unexpectedly abnormal. Having thrust a hot dog up his ass and smeared himself with ketchup, he positions himself on all fours and “goes down” on a slab of glistening raw meat, burying his face in it, taking it in his teeth, drooling and spitting on it, and finally rubbing it over his body. He then adds ground beef to the mix, spreading it across the bed along with the steak, hot dogs, and ketchup and thrusting his body back and forth with increasing agitation, as if simultaneously humping and being humped by it. Such antics continue for nearly 45 minutes.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/wV58RuTsAKGmNfi0lcKOKDzX3O7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailor's Meat (Sailor's Delight)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul McCarthy","original_name":"Paul McCarthy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2S4OQ33uRj7m3Fn1765o3bDvJi0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6681dabadaf75d2239dd4613","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul McCarthy","original_name":"Paul McCarthy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2S4OQ33uRj7m3Fn1765o3bDvJi0.jpg","credit_id":"61b4cba1d14443004136f324","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9CaQtoDQImZnNhVu9HeqoVumbwq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1179},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wV58RuTsAKGmNfi0lcKOKDzX3O7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
