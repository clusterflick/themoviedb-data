This is a story of life put on “repeat”, story of permanent loss and discovery. My father lives in Donetsk and started losing his memory when armed hostilities began. Now he can`t remember the latest 10 minutes of his life. I come home after I haven`t seen my parents for a year. I talk to Dad, trying to pull out some of his memories through music, books and family stories. We can hear the shelling far off. But that is not the worst - even harder is the loss of memory, gradually taking my Dad away from his family and his past, squeezing the world to a few simple and important things.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aQI28EbJqQE3ouC2xtpABGQWCCz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Bastille","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Yoho Bastyliia","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343735,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Viktoriia Gusenok","original_name":"Viktoriia Gusenok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4a33aa3d0270063a1e518","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3343731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valeria Treshchova","original_name":"Valeria Treshchova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4a32bec4552004257a060","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3343731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valeria Treshchova","original_name":"Valeria Treshchova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4a349bfeb8b009a95b61f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4095210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sashko Sviatsky","original_name":"Sashko Sviatsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647bba2f0e29a20116ace53a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16394212","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aQI28EbJqQE3ouC2xtpABGQWCCz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
