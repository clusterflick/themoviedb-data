The film short-circuits the hegemony of the Pope and bypasses the power of the Catholic church - indeed, of institutionalized religion altogether. We want to connect with the Creator of all things, wile challenging all religions of the world. We have no organized structure, no rules. Our only mission is to return what rightfully belongs to each individual on this earth. Through this film, we offer a direct connection to that which had been withheld for thousands of years.
