Hippos fight for territory while herds of elephant, water buffalo and zebra depend on it for life. In the wet season the rains burst the riverbanks and everyone, including people, must move whilst fish swim through the villages. In the dry season the creatures fight over the few pools of water while predators prowl. At its heart it plunges over Victoria Falls and into wild ravines before draining into the Indian Ocean, where storm clouds cycle the water back into the heart of Africa.","popularity":0.347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zambezi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Frain","original_name":"James Frain","popularity":1.0385,"profile_path":"/9Ara3C7D53uq7Oefdt4qRF5gGFJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b5f01aec45520042598fd9","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2496558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
