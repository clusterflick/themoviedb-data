By now he should be a dad but things have not worked out. This is where reproduction scientist Holley Muraco comes in. Holley is taking on the biggest challenge of her career - trying to help Sivuqaq become a parent. Yet walrus love is a mystery - even pandas have been bred more successfully than walruses. Holley hopes the clues lie in in exploring the lives of Sivuqaq's wild cousins and that she can find the answers by journeying to their breeding grounds in Northern Alaska.","popularity":0.1852,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walrus: Two Tonne Tusker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Palmer","original_name":"Geoffrey Palmer","popularity":0.5179,"profile_path":"/wfFydeTnTIdtu8oKcY7SCo7u7pg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b5d9006a344800889ffd99","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8656818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
