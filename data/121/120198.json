But for now they exist in a malaise of dissatisfaction. Soldiers from the local military post provide them some companionship and society, but nothing can suffice to replace Moscow in their hopes. Andrei marries a provincial girl, Natasha, and begins to settle into a life of much less meaning than he had hoped. Natasha begins to run the family her way. Masha, though married, yearns for the sophisticated life and begins a dalliance with Vershinin, an army officer with a sick and suicidal wife. Even Irina, the freshest, most optimistic of the sisters, begins to waver in her dreams until, finally, tragedy strikes.","popularity":2.745,"poster_path":"/qnYQiwV4ClanqxviEWGxhD71ota.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1970-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":162,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Hopkins","original_name":"Anthony Hopkins","popularity":5.0874,"profile_path":"/cbFWUHhk6pZKTEm48OKVM5awNNn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Andrey","credit_id":"52fe4a41c3a368484e1491bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Suzman","original_name":"Janet Suzman","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/5H1cxIbRuIlpqOxU1rsGAetrsyi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Masha","credit_id":"5c3a9fccc3a368086947e422","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eileen Atkins","original_name":"Eileen Atkins","popularity":0.8208,"profile_path":"/8gac03PfTFz2vByZi1aun0NiTqM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"5c3a9fdb9251414dd774cd9c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Dotrice","original_name":"Michele Dotrice","popularity":0.6969,"profile_path":"/rtBoI6uwH3GCNb7EF3YUHm9HwJ7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Irina","credit_id":"5c3a9fe49251414de574b5e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bryant","original_name":"Michael Bryant","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/ytSwr1kt43fIFPIXzW7q3UuFeAu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Vershinin","credit_id":"5c3a9fef9251414dcc74c737","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joss Ackland","original_name":"Joss Ackland","popularity":0.6238,"profile_path":"/2votqyrYGvSsXKaPNIa0CZtvBMY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Chebutykin","credit_id":"5c3a9ff90e0a2644270226a6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Badel","original_name":"Sarah Badel","popularity":0.4946,"profile_path":"/8ZFn8Nx2IehUR6kFbGSGKOUdz0i.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Natasha","credit_id":"5c3aa003c3a3680858478baf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Pearson","original_name":"Richard Pearson","popularity":0.4365,"profile_path":"/fHLK1HrQ0sly4KXdZhQCKl6i8fW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Koolyghin","credit_id":"5c3aa012c3a368085347a701","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Pickering","original_name":"Donald Pickering","popularity":0.3031,"profile_path":"/xDb98Hxo3P0Vif2jmKS8a4ydSO6.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Soliony","credit_id":"5c3aa01c0e0a2644270226cd","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109469,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anton Chekhov","original_name":"Антон Чехов","popularity":0.449,"profile_path":"/jQlZSJWHZTZrBvSfqb8me8S8peP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a41c3a368484e1491b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cedric Messina","original_name":"Cedric Messina","popularity":0.117,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a41c3a368484e1491bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0065098","wikidata_id":"Q7797797","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qnYQiwV4ClanqxviEWGxhD71ota.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1117}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
