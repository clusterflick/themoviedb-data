A troubled young man, David Peters (Ian Holm), claims, \"Once dreams were possible, that's what the popular songs told us.\" Rejecting rock music of the day, Peters is immersed in the tunes of Thirties crooner Al Bowlly (killed during the London blitz). He collects Bowlly memorabilia, publishes the Bowlly fan-club newsletter, and finds pleasure in lip-synching Bowlly records but his obsession with Bowlly masks certain darker events in his past.","popularity":1.0443,"poster_path":"/a9ytQZdC4xSKhB3f6vX6FNyr6cW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6197,"logo_path":"/6LFn6YTFLtqNFkWw85csFErB2dv.png","name":"LWT","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":27023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kestrel Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moonlight on the Highway","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Holm","original_name":"Ian Holm","popularity":1.4643,"profile_path":"/9YbuYOqOmYwReBAj9Hh6z7DWwhH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"556d60dac3a3680e8a00027d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Bate","original_name":"Anthony Bate","popularity":0.2385,"profile_path":"/aWYhEdz0ZtKdA1SA2bS7D8fHcoj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"556d60e0c3a3680e9d000289","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Grant","original_name":"Deborah Grant","popularity":0.4461,"profile_path":"/47mRyXxGH2Uz7AMKV5qCknMNmLA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"556d60e9925141422a000261","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Wentworth","original_name":"Robin Wentworth","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"556d60f49251414218000271","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Peisley","original_name":"Frederick Peisley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"556d60fdc3a3680e8a000284","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190514,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James MacTaggart","original_name":"James MacTaggart","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a42c3a368484e1493d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dennis Potter","original_name":"Dennis Potter","popularity":0.3684,"profile_path":"/oiymzgh2XvUZVNjqIarbBW1il06.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a42c3a368484e1493d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0064692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1113,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/a9ytQZdC4xSKhB3f6vX6FNyr6cW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":742}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
