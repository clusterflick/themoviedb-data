Dali devoted two weeks of his life to creating extraordinary scenes for the film, performing \"manifestations\" with a plaster cast. A thousand ants and one million dollars in cash. When he confronts the feminist writer, Jane Arden, sparks fly. \"You are my Slave! I am not your slave. Everybody is my slave.\" Dali recalls his meeting with Freud, \"The last human relationship ever\" About his wife, 'But for Gala I would be lying in a gutter somewhere covered with lice\" Jim Desmond's dazzling cinematography captures the great artist painting as Flamenco virtuoso Manitas de Plata performs.
