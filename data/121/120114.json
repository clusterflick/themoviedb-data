German troops retreat from Ukraine. The Directory, the Ukrainian national government lead by Symon Petliura, takes control of Kyiv. Meanwhile, the Bolshevik division commanded by Mykola Shchors is marching on the capital. The Bolsheviks capture the cities of Vinnytsia, Zhmerynka, and others one by one, but lose Berdychiv to Petliura’s forces. They are demoralized by the defeat. By his personal example of courage and military skill, Shchors inspires the retreating Red troops and leads them to victory over the enemy.","popularity":0.4264,"poster_path":"/8GlVmw839sSV3AFGtMlsgiKYc05.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13896,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kiev Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1939-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shors","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Shchors","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniy Samoylov","original_name":"Evgeniy Samoylov","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/zoBgUl3JsIhuhsZBNmMxXOvQMrY.jpg","cast_id":33,"character":"Nikolay Shchors","credit_id":"5883a6b9c3a368064a00b536","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Skuratov","original_name":"Ivan Skuratov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bozhenko","credit_id":"55420cf39251414af6003921","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Borysohlibska","original_name":"Hanna Borysohlibska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Old Woman","credit_id":"55420d93c3a3681da5003b25","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentyn Dukler","original_name":"Valentyn Dukler","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Isaac Tyshler","credit_id":"55420d9dc3a3681dab003acb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1461059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Grechanyy","original_name":"Александр Гречаный","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mikhailyuk","credit_id":"55420db69251414af3003a74","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1461061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fyodor Ishchenko","original_name":"Fyodor Ishchenko","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/1SkPY3p5xipiLw5d0sFNJBfQzJk.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Petro Chish","credit_id":"55420de4c3a3681da00039dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.
