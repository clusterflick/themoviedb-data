Keith Andes plays an ex-Communist who is strongarmed into cooperating with the Feds. Pretending to become a \"comrade\" again, Andes rejoins the local Communist cell. Moving about freely, he is able to track down a gang of spies who are smuggling atomic secrets. Filmed on location in New York, Project X has the surface \"feel\" of a documentary, though the dialogue is strictly from the funny papers. Keep an eye out for a very young Jack Lord.","popularity":0.9548,"poster_path":"/ndiboLUaAs7mG66SOVscnQvirmQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's Bait!","title":"Project X","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Andes","original_name":"Keith Andes","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/na8kkJgaGprZApP5s6sG5aR9YCR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Steve Monahan","credit_id":"52fe4a46c3a368484e14a30d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Colton","original_name":"Rita Colton","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sandra Russell","credit_id":"52fe4a46c3a368484e14a311","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lord","original_name":"Jack Lord","popularity":0.8392,"profile_path":"/laGKjiYuFGtmFFYPyZaJZJ0xBT5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Bates","credit_id":"52fe4a46c3a368484e14a315","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kit Russell","original_name":"Kit Russell","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Michael Radik","credit_id":"52fe4a46c3a368484e14a319","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Montagne","original_name":"Edward Montagne","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a46c3a368484e14a309","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0041770","wikidata_id":"Q65080653","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqBXpmemmJCDhuImzritP6oOVDu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ndiboLUaAs7mG66SOVscnQvirmQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":173686,"name":"red scare"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
