Witness the inspired twin-lead guitar interplay between two of the greatest living guitarists, Michael Schenker and Uli Jon Roth during some electrifying renditions of several UFO classics. A historic moment was captured when Jack Bruce joined Uli and Clive Bunker on the stage without any prior rehearsal whatsoever, to invoke the spirit of one of rock's most legendary supergroups -- Cream. Although Uli and Jack had never before performed any of these songs together, it was evident from the first few notes onwards that the unique chemistry between these two giants of rock resulted in an authentic and moving interpretation of the spirit of Cream.","popularity":0.1559,"poster_path":"/wtYOOYPWGyMxy9xgTlKq0YNgYG5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uli Jon Roth : Legends of Rock - Live At Castle Donington 2001","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schenker","original_name":"Michael Schenker","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/7ozaKMAZAZ2o2debf07YJAJqppC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"608487d2960cde006f09ed0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2204033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Mogg","original_name":"Phil Mogg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kkcuP26HQi7O84KjdCs2bqLpyea.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"608487e9904f6d004153df28","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Bruce","original_name":"Jack Bruce","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/44ZS1s2iKgnjHEq7mv0QtJOKdKW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"60848808839018006f07dfa0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Way","original_name":"Pete Way","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qfkkjk9ZHaHrJLnBCAxqZUjPTYy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"60848822e61e6d0057154517","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uli Jon Roth","original_name":"Uli Jon Roth","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/jnORRYJ4Q8Xr1vpjvjWVLD0Zc2s.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"60848846f92532007c565693","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1918423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clive Bunker","original_name":"Clive Bunker","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/vK4z3AUub4OMfax9ugdP4ScYYBW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"60848863839018005874c224","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b5pLdiY2bPi9yWHpsW1Ah0GU3Nl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wtYOOYPWGyMxy9xgTlKq0YNgYG5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
