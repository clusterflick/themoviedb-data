Now he finds himself wasting away in a slack-jawed, low profile town coaching a second rate college program. Once again, he has miraculously brought this unlikely team to the finals. As his behavior on the day of the championship game indicates, he is far more successful at the game of basketball than the game of life. The question remains: if he finally wins the big game, will Coach Adler get his life back on track or is he already too far gone...
