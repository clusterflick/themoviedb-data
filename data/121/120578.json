Set in Paris, Otto and Leo both fall in love with Gilda. She cannot make up her mind which man she loves, so the three decide to live together in a platonic friendship. Among Coward's trademark sparkling wit, the play explores deeper themes including infidelity, the pressures of fame on an unstable mind, and morality (or immorality) of a menage a trois.","popularity":1.5405,"poster_path":"/p65xAGPWJqGbEGTJyvZOFp39MFJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1979-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Design for Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rula Lenska","original_name":"Rula Lenska","popularity":0.5393,"profile_path":"/4lgQ8AIVaQQxgLnl097PRMu8pp8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gilda","credit_id":"5c028a8492514116540962a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clive Arrindell","original_name":"Clive Arrindell","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/b4Yakpy1UXl8R5w06ZARmyUhpJy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Otto","credit_id":"5c028a8d9251410b9208ddf4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Steiner","original_name":"John Steiner","popularity":0.3346,"profile_path":"/esKMm8Izkba1PR2PMjLUcEdVdE3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Leo","credit_id":"5c028a9c925141132908d056","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bluthal","original_name":"John Bluthal","popularity":0.3077,"profile_path":"/vdM8UyPL8Plaroa7rlOVX4SWbJ6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ernest Friedman","credit_id":"5c028aa79251417e2e03f691","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dandy Nichols","original_name":"Dandy Nichols","popularity":0.3334,"profile_path":"/kOF7x205JqOyjwWkgAWzkMtQBcn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Hodge","credit_id":"5c028ab20e0a26486604bfcb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Saville","original_name":"Philip Saville","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":"/8F1WR2Ouo8Qnbe4ngzaNtHKmCpd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a368484e14b0fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12718,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noël Coward","original_name":"Noël Coward","popularity":0.2903,"profile_path":"/20dd32wR8putmUni8BK7ABx5ThM.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a368484e14b103","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0261646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p65xAGPWJqGbEGTJyvZOFp39MFJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dod8cAQfCoQnZnaQMLVPRRTRTrD.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
