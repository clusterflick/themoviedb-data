This annual pilgrimage took 6 months and the path was so well used that the track is beaten deep into the rocks all the way from China to the giant tea market in Lhasa.  Learn more about where one of the world’s favourite drinks comes from and revel in the stunning cinematography, all in striking high definition.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tea Road To The Skies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
