Hank soon discovers something strange buried in the ground beneath...something large, metallic and not of this earth. Dormant for over 200 years, the objectâ€™s power returns, resurrecting the hibernating occupants from a long slumber and turning the Taylor farm into an arena of heart-pounding terror. As the inhabitants of the farm take refuge in the secluded farm house, a group of mysterious covert government agents callously monitors the situation. Why have the Aliens traveled to Earth? Are the Government Agents hiding something?","popularity":0.5229,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Awakened","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Picardo","original_name":"Robert Picardo","popularity":0.6658,"profile_path":"/9TOY0mhWRMlU5Ur8QHMoDecWs2n.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Maddox","credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfdd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072707,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matt Corrigan","original_name":"Matt Corrigan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Alien","credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfe1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gross","original_name":"Richard Gross","popularity":0.3547,"profile_path":"/3daVinT1uHYxHCcPN5zCiHWaHyl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfe5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kara Hamilton","original_name":"Kara Hamilton","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jess","credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfe9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corrie Henninger","original_name":"Corrie Henninger","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Beth","credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Leveck","original_name":"Jonathan Leveck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Andrew Hubbard","credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bff1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adrian DeLude","original_name":"Adrian DeLude","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Nichols","original_name":"Eric Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adrian DeLude","original_name":"Adrian DeLude","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfcd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592543,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Marlowe","original_name":"James Marlowe","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfd3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103031,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Nicholas","original_name":"Eric Nicholas","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a4ec3a368484e14bfd9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony E.
