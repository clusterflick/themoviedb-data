Joe status quo, boldly remixed and reassembled the toys of their parent's generation. Birthing a new format of toy and medium of artistic expression, these artists were the first to explore The Vinyl Frontier. A world where Art is Fun! By exploring a landscape inhabited by a wide range of artists, their creations, and obsessive collectors, the documentary examines the hybrid objects' artistic and commercial value, as well as the creative process of art-toy making. The Vinyl Frontier is a comprehensive look at a fresh and exciting art movement that anyone young at heart and imaginative can enjoy.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exploring the world of vinyl toys","title":"The Vinyl Frontier","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1399114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Vinyl Frontier Trailer","key":"BwsQ9fV11-Q","published_at":"2011-03-29T06:36:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e8c3a3685448008cc7"}]}}}
