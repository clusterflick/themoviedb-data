The Loveland Dance Hall is one of the tenants of the Vanderkill estates. To reassure his aunt Sophie, Vanderkill visits Loveland to determine whether it is as disreputable as Sophie suspects. There he meets a dime-a-dance girl, Madeleine MacGonagal, who charms him with her quaint proletarian accent. They begin a secret affair, which turns into a secret marriage when pregnancy ensues. When the baby fails to survive, Madeleine decides that since he had married her only for the baby's sake, she should make haste to Mexico to secure a divorce. There she meets Panama Canal Kelly, a former suitor who now owns a silver mine. Her plans for divorce and quick remarriage are complicated when Vanderkill arrives to confront her.","popularity":0.5967,"poster_path":"/2zariOqcN7Kh5jnASMWFBzb84Jp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The drama of a good girl with a bad name!","title":"Child of Manhattan","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Carroll","original_name":"Nancy Carroll","popularity":0.1385,"profile_path":"/ptkv8zyMZDgU8uJv8TWON0ZibIy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madelaine McGonagle","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cdd1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Boles","original_name":"John Boles","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":"/eVu8Tzdi3UYrCApUW221CSXoAHt.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Paul Vanderkill","credit_id":"55129102c3a36861610010ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buck Jones","original_name":"Buck Jones","popularity":0.1482,"profile_path":"/mO2WCdlygUVNr3yg8AiOCvcNHOC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"\"Panama Canal\" Kelley","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cdd5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessie Ralph","original_name":"Jessie Ralph","popularity":0.3227,"profile_path":"/gy4W2M3Jpi4kb7NTc6MPHUhHgc0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aunt Minnie","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cde1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Blandick","original_name":"Clara Blandick","popularity":0.3632,"profile_path":"/1V1QarPPNpJak9WKuF4RzmtiasW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Aunt Sophie","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cde5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Alberni","original_name":"Luis Alberni","popularity":0.1843,"profile_path":"/l9T44h8op9ZT3Xx0RrhAzT6jaMc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Carlos Spumoni Bustamente","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cde9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warburton Gamble","original_name":"Warburton Gamble","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/suUhUL3vS3ORLJ6PcHwnwD9dlVi.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Stephen Eggleston","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cded","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Darwell","original_name":"Jane Darwell","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":"/xWTsj5z2N94OOnimMmUYewQXOIi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. McGonagle","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cdd9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garry Owen","original_name":"Garry Owen","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":"/4lXrRqVoopFMS8hPEaR7BwEtLmD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Buddy McGonagle","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cdf5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Grable","original_name":"Betty Grable","popularity":0.4057,"profile_path":"/oQwgN9Qx3w4S6u6rQFbl5TtUTsL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lucy McGonagle","credit_id":"52fe4a53c3a368484e14cddd","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Pendleton","original_name":"Nat Pendleton","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/9rZC8qMgJTJ7QYgg6ckXIv8uYRd.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Spyrene -
