Sir Ernest Pease (Robertson-Justice) is a self-important scientist who is sent undercover on a bombing mission to monitor the effectiveness of his latest invention, a new-fangled radar. When the plane is attacked, he parachutes to safety - only to be sent to a POW camp, where he takes on the alias of Lieutenant Farrow. There, the somewhat happy-go-lucky bunch of Brits suspect their acerbic new fellow prisoner of being a spy, and all sorts of culture clashes and misunderstandings ensue.","popularity":1.6202,"poster_path":"/e9hFEC0mNdCGJ81V5BQlL0n0WHT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Artists","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1961-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Even the GERMAN ARMY couldn't fight this...","title":"Very Important Person","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Robertson Justice","original_name":"James Robertson Justice","popularity":0.2987,"profile_path":"/u0fYhKndmqr99KGV6SOhjXuMOnX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sir Ernest Pease KBE FRS / Lt.
