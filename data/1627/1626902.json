We also explore the culture and environment that created several of the seven wonders.  This episode examines two unparalleled testaments to the power of the era: The Pharos (Lighthouse) at Alexandria, which stood more that 300 feet, making it the tallest structure of its time, and the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was considered one of the greatest tombs ever created. The Mausoleum's perimieter was not decoreated with icons of ancient gods, as was the custom of the time, but with ennobled and enlarged figures of real people. These statues are thought to have been an inspiration for the citizens - telling them they could be as great as the gods.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/efvNG4ghpnwMInVKdwUqLydI2Xo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Author and archaeologist John Romer, explores the culture and environment that created the Pharos of Alexandria and the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.","title":"Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: The Magic Metropolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Romer","original_name":"John Romer","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":"/RhM2dpSLUhehTxcYCyENbNcjmz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"697f239df5116fee8fd44685","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vmeVuV7blWS7knu8hTCvJSq9fVx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2561}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/efvNG4ghpnwMInVKdwUqLydI2Xo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
