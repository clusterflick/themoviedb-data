After the only television station under Ceaușescu's dictatorship, Romanian TV, which served exclusively for propaganda and personality cult purposes, stopped broadcasting major sporting events (European Championships, World Cups, etc.) in the 1980s, residents of the country's interior regions were forced to find an alternative solution: they went to the mountains near their settlements to watch prestigious sporting events with the help of improvised antennas capable of receiving television broadcasts from neighboring Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Szabadság a hegyen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
