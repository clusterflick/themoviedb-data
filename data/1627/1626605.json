No patient has ever been discharged, and there are unconfirmed reports of torture and unethical experiments on the patients. As her alter ego, she visits the facility to interview the director, Dr. Harleen Quinnzel. When the interview is cut short, she investigates Harleen's computer and finds the reports of torture are true. She rolls into action, only to discover Dr. Quinnzel's laboratory, a strange and mysterious room filled with freakish toys and torturous tools. Before she can process what she's encountered, the dolls come to life and attack her without abandon. Suddenly, Dr. Quinnzel appears on a screen. Harleen's message is clear. SG is meant to be tortured and ultimately taught a lesson. Surely, SG can escape, but the attacks come quickly and without warning. What will happen to poor SG?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freak Show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5611156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco","original_name":"Coco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mcTCtHM2CaW7sFqISdzYSrQNlG5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Superior Girl","credit_id":"697e6b1fa3afc3d25b6f6f6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5805272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harper Hunt","original_name":"Harper Hunt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Harleen","credit_id":"697e6ba0dbfa1bdbf60e71d6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e6b33e6eda12231973fca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e6b3fe0631355da6f6fbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
