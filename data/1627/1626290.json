Mirroring the dialogue at its core, it mixes 16mm film and digital images, performance and nature footage to illustrate the revolutionary themes and ideas that would combine to craft the album A Love Supreme: the generative practice of meditation, the creative potential of communion with nature, and the cosmologies of Black musical masters of the early to mid-1960s. It also celebrates John Coltrane’s formative connection to the city of Philadelphia. Harkening to the Akan principles of Sankofa, the musician returns to his home to reclaim lost parts of himself and complete his circle of evolution.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speakn’Trane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
