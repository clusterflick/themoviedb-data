The film also pays tribute to Goh Choo-San, a pioneering Singapore-born choreographer. Choreographed by Daeun Jung in collaboration with director Kang Seung Lee, the piece draws inspiration from Goh's ballet \"Unknown Territory\" (1986), known for blending classical ballet with contemporary introspection. In his multilayered video work, symbols from American Sign Language further challenge our perceptions of communication. The use of sambe—a traditional Korean funeral fabric—deepens the rituals of mourning embedded within the work, honoring the lives and memories lost to the AIDS epidemic. - Alexander Gray Associates","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lazarus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5975036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Jimenez Montes","original_name":"Gabriel Jimenez Montes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"697d6864324096a80c616349","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5975037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Wong","original_name":"Kevin Wong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"697d687d3d738b867c1bb9b0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5426501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kang Seung Lee","original_name":"Kang Seung Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d67eb92c2157bb37386c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5975034,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"DaEun Jung","original_name":"DaEun Jung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d683b8ebcdac8c3ea0c2b","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5975035,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathan Mercury Kim","original_name":"Nathan Mercury Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d6856d729f280c07385b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5975035,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathan Mercury Kim","original_name":"Nathan Mercury Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d697b6cda5abc45ea0ccf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2675460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Jinsoo Kim","original_name":"김진수","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/rqF8V698iOr9x9jlRD4f6suTnIb.jpg","credit_id":"697d69a03d738b867c1bb9c6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5975041,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Leo Escobar","original_name":"Leo Escobar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d69b7324096a80c616363","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3224354,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathan Kadota","original_name":"Nathan Kadota","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d69c3324096a80c616366","department":"Camera","job":"Key Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Villareal","original_name":"Santiago Villareal","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d69d32deb225af67386f1","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Villareal","original_name":"Santiago Villareal","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d69ee205b5446c4616282","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3652312,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ruoyi Shi","original_name":"Ruoyi Shi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d69fe324096a80c61636a","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5975042,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carmen Vargas","original_name":"Carmen Vargas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d6a12288ee8840615e212","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3105469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Palacios","original_name":"Maria Palacios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697d6a2487299b04c9719a49","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Tailor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Biennale Art Exhibition, \"Stranieri Ovunque - Foreigners Everywhere\"","release_date":"2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Korea","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
