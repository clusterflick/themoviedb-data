She has just lost her mother and is suddenly sent to a boarding high school in Montpellier, the city of her paternal grandparents, after having spent her entire life in Spain. When the holidays arrive, she travels to Seville to see Luis again—an elderly Romani cantaor, her mother’s former partner and her lifelong accomplice. These reunions, the screening of a film they were never able to finish eight years earlier, and the upheavals of a minority which, in the age of technology, longs to integrate, abruptly sacrificing all the specific traits that had tirelessly shaped it until then, will entail—beyond the mourning of childhood—the realization of a paradise forever lost.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sol y sombra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
