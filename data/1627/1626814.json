That was the weekend the IRA went to war.\"  Soldiers speak with unprecedented frankness to journalist Peter Taylor , an experienced observer of the Troubles, about a world where provocation and frustration can lead to a bitter and brutal reaction: \"If it's after dark and he's a known IRA 'player', he's gonna get a serious kicking.\"  Fear of death is a daily emotion: nearly 650 soldiers have been killed in a quarter of a century. But one soldier sums up their shared attitude: \"Everything you do that stops the terrorists is worth it. If we save one life, we've achieved something.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"25 Bloody Years: A Soldier's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
