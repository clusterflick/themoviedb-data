A family weekend that unearths buried secrets – ones that might have been better left buried forever. A legendary VHS tape that someone would be willing to kill for – or perhaps already has. And a childhood story that proves years later that sometimes the most frightening things are those we believed to be true as children.  Horrorszkóp and the Cruel World Team present four dark and disturbing stories in this horror anthology. Each one is haunted by the shadow of death, human frailty, and the realization that the outcome is never what we expect.\r Four stories. Four secrets. Four inevitable endings.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/dLw6aWlLr0cDWpqQjOjnFIOeHEX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"a halál négy kapuja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dLw6aWlLr0cDWpqQjOjnFIOeHEX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
