It's predicted to make the company billions but there's a problem. To complete the formula, scientists at Lab Corp require a concentrated hormone found only in the female body that is generated when she's experiencing pain and pleasure simultaneously. Lab Corp has tried extracting the hormone from women, but the director of the project realizes only a female Super will be able to produce what they need. With billions on the line, the scientist will do absolutely anything to extract that which he needs, and Redwing becomes his target. After capturing her, he puts her in a sensory deprivation tank with a special liquid designed to keep Red in a deep sleep. He then plugs her into a virtual world of his own design.  She'll be too much of a liability and could terminate the entire project. But first, what does it take to physically best Redwing while forcing arousal.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reality Bites","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5611156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco","original_name":"Coco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mcTCtHM2CaW7sFqISdzYSrQNlG5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Redwing","credit_id":"697e7f048ae40ca0f3d4439b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e7f11f12c1be29c6f706f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e7f1c656ac808fedc975a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
