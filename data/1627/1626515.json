She's a caring housewife and excels at her primary task—pleasing and providing a comfortable life for her husband, Boris, a musician and conservatory teacher. Vera might have lived a somewhat dull and stable life if not for her younger sister, Nika, who unexpectedly and unceremoniously intruded on their family idyll. Vera isn't happy about the unexpected visit, and for good reason. She and her sister became strangers after Nika \"stole\" Vera's happiness, stealing her sister's fiancé, her first \"school love.\" Now Nika has separated from her husband and is once again \"actively searching.\" And, as several years ago, Nika's choice once again falls on Vera's chosen one. It seems history is repeating itself. But this time, Vera isn't giving up.
