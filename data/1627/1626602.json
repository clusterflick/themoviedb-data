To infiltrate his operation, WG poses as a gentleman's entertainer for hire and garners an interview with Anton himself. She thinks she has the drop on Anton, but it turns out to be the other way around. Anton is tipped off and has procured an extremely powerful sedative, strong enough to put any Super down. When she comes in for the \"interview\", Anton plays along and at first WG doesn't suspect anything. She even feels comfortable to drink the wine he offers up. Her senses dulled by her overconfidence, WG shortly finds herself woozy and powerless. She manages to transform but it's too late.  Anton knows if he can figure out the source of her power and remove it, she will be his to use. The fact that she's already cost him millions by medaling in his affairs fuels his motivation and creates within him a ruthless determination to break her and remove her powers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5611156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco","original_name":"Coco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mcTCtHM2CaW7sFqISdzYSrQNlG5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wonderous Girl","credit_id":"697e6985804572d2e9dc970e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e69ed9429317fa3dc979d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e6a1eab1c738c7270e61b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
