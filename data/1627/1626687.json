A group of diverse Young Women, converts to the Church, find out when they travel from New York City to attend Especially for Youth (EFY) in Utah for a week. But when they arrive at Brigham Young University they feel more out of place then ever. Different music, strange accents, and lack of common interests prevent the girls from feeling like they belong. Being at EFY feels like just being on a different planet. But little by little, things change.  The ground-breaking documentary explores questions of conversion, culture, and the power of faith. It shows that through the gospel, people can come to interact and to love each other across challenging cultural boundaries and truly become Sisterz in Zion.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of conversion, culture, and the power of faith","title":"Sisterz in Zion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
