One day, she notices the red heels of a woman entering their house. The woman greets Jamal, but the girl is too shy to approach her. Hearing the conversation between the woman and her grandmother, Jamal realises that this beautiful woman is her mother. Jamal gradually gets closer to the woman, opens up to her and spends time sleeping next to her mother. Morning comes. Jamal wakes up and realises that the woman is gone. She goes out into the corridor and sees that the red shoes have disappeared.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/j1TfXd8pdZdgQyEQkyIR1zXU5FL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tartaly","origin_country":""},{"id":89299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemanía","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":74486,"logo_path":"/pLkapE3cPFdM0695eoawyNavr06.png","name":"Kyrgyzfilm","origin_country":"KG"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"Red Heels","title":"Red Heels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5976690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regina Talantbekova","original_name":"Regina Talantbekova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"697e3fb065e4b5050d1c5718","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5976694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anara Nazarkulova","original_name":"Anara Nazarkulova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"697e3fc985092011aa0e7157","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aisanat Edigeeva","original_name":"Aisanat Edigeeva","popularity":0.0293,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"697e3fd3650a32eec76f6e97","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3704222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Baitokova","original_name":"Alina Baitokova","popularity":0.0268,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e400eaf7a19aff9dc9680","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3704222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Baitokova","original_name":"Alina Baitokova","popularity":0.0268,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e4031fc9903f56edc964b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5976711,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aiperi Muratbekova","original_name":"Aiperi Muratbekova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e405ad6f7dbae14bbda7c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5976713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Narmin Muradova","original_name":"Narmin Muradova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e4079e0631355da6f6e9c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elnura Osmonalieva","original_name":"Elnura Osmonalieva","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e40863aa880903fd4424f","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5976715,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rita Babanova","original_name":"Rita Babanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e4092485352d9d4bbda3b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5106740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tynystan Temirzhan","original_name":"Tynystan Temirzhan","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/fPZuHiKtckzApmW1ZuzR8UvGjRd.jpg","credit_id":"697e40aa485352d9d4bbda40","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5976724,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ademi Manabaeva","original_name":"Ademi Manabaeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e411af5116fee8fd4427c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5108183,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Asel Razakulova","original_name":"Asel Razakulova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e4131bfd69710b11c5733","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3704221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aiturgan Ainakulova","original_name":"Aiturgan Ainakulova","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e414e39a492ca87973f27","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2882702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Lazareva","original_name":"Svetlana Lazareva","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e41bfab1c738c7270e51f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1TfXd8pdZdgQyEQkyIR1zXU5FL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Tampere Film Festival","release_date":"2026-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
