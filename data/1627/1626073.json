Community members already struggling to make ends meet have been forced to wake before dawn just to make it to work. Others are now spending money they don’t have on private rides. Still more are standing for over an hour on crowded buses, worried about sickness and tired from the rest of their commute. As the freezing temperatures approach, concerns are rising. RIPTA advocates will present their case to lawmakers in January and until then, these bus riders have been left out to dry on the unforgiving streets of Rhode Island.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bus Cuts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
