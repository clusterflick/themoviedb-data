These paintings date back to prehistoric times (10,000 to 5,000 years ago) and are located on an uninhabited rocky plateau whose highest point reaches 2,158 meters. Considered one of the largest and oldest \"open-air rock art museums\" in the world, the Tassili n'Ajjer boasts a particularly rugged landscape: the vast rocky plains, which sometimes give way to \"forests\" of monoliths, are riddled with akbas (holes in the escarpments accessible only on foot or by camel) and numerous faults and canyons. The Tassili n’Ajjer National Park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982 and classified as a biosphere reserve in 1986.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dgvSgdzx398rkzQsTGiRxEsiwZT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terra Senzo Tempo","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"أرض بلا زمن","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5977544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Mottura Bona","original_name":"Elena Mottura Bona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697eb41b7a8d0b8bc1d44454","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5977544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Mottura Bona","original_name":"Elena Mottura Bona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697eb429a63679139a1c595b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/htxZZ8eBglg92sWGMopSCWslECv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mMMC2Ak4wmGEtwqRgniSFL8PzOS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cDrWM5IKKVLLE7jms8hF2lZH1ij.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vNI9aZ9X0p486HA9M1iqNjLsTj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dgvSgdzx398rkzQsTGiRxEsiwZT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":249821,"name":"trekking"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":320760,"name":"algerian sahara"},{"id":327017,"name":"djanet"},{"id":355514,"name":"italian expedition"},{"id":362716,"name":"mountaineering documentary in algeria"},{"id":366807,"name":"rock paintings"},{"id":366808,"name":"tassili n'ajjer national park"},{"id":366809,"name":"tassili n'ajjer mountain range"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Trento Film Festival","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
