When I set to work, it turned into an intense confrontation between mother and son. I finally learned the unvarnished story of my mother's life and began to understand why we both became who we are. I interwove the film image with two layers of sound: the Suite in C minor for violoncello, Bach, and dialogical texts spoken by mother and son, based on our conversations and describing how she gave birth to her seven children during the years of Hitler's fascism. I will continue to work on my mother's biography.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meine Mutter wird sichtbar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1516158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Armbruster","original_name":"Klaus Armbruster","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697e1386bc0cdcf11ce4e986","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
