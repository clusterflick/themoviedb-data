Over the years, he has collected their audio messages and video calls, transforming them into a portrait of her life in Lebanon and his own in Belgium. This very intimate yet social piece reveals a complex relationship marked by the distance between the two characters and shows what one may experience as a homosexual migrant. By turns moving, provocative, and hilarious, Mea Culpa questions the links between national and sexual identities for a young Palestinian migrant.","popularity":0.3279,"poster_path":"/igGQUy1ZLwcCSgMcMTPQkWg2PuQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139172,"logo_path":"/xCpC0XD53yvgLeTsSMCK781TERx.png","name":"Atelier Graphoui","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mea Culpa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tass","original_name":"Patrick Tass","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66c5d45271ec89bd83d12df8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897424,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diana Tass","original_name":"Diana Tass","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66c5d4bbfb284b5ada2d5154","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897418,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lynn Abiad","original_name":"Lynn Abiad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5d17e51395eadfa71462f","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897422,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bryn Watkins","original_name":"Bryn Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5d20f59557e0fef1ce34f","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897424,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diana Tass","original_name":"Diana Tass","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5d220b2d4cfa480dfdffb","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2755599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ellen Meiresonne","original_name":"Ellen Meiresonne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5d37065f9a7d4faf73b5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tass","original_name":"Patrick Tass","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5cee21742a4e306714b65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tass","original_name":"Patrick Tass","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5d1ed14a62e4bddade826","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2898047,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sébastien Demeffe","original_name":"Sébastien Demeffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5d120e77c158e4dd0797e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3583361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Ferrando","original_name":"Thomas Ferrando","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724cc36c1212313ac7ec716","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3583361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Ferrando","original_name":"Thomas Ferrando","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724cc69c4aa98945ef34f69","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35822552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/igGQUy1ZLwcCSgMcMTPQkWg2PuQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1358}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":251150,"name":"cultural identity"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mea Culpa/ Trailer / Patrick Tass / 2023 / St Fr","key":"816936427","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-12T14:34:23.000Z","id":"66c5d5ae22cb79a0e72502b0"}]}}}
