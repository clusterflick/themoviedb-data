This quote from Pierre Lévêque about the illustrations in Tomb of the Diver resonated when I watched the viral video of a young man who was executed in Iran in 2020. A few days after his death, the grainy mobile video of him was released. He ran in slow motion and dove into a pool. Like an act of preservation, I filmed the video with a super 8 camera. The camera became a tool of magnifying and grieving. Three years later, men and women still chanted his name in protests. Like the waves after a dive, injustice has a ripple effect.
