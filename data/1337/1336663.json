The consul persuades him to play the long-lost son of a Castilian family, and tattoos a coat of arms on the back of the Kid's hand to make the deception complete. The Kid is taken into the household, trusted and loved by the gladdened mother. For the first time he has a home. The romance develops. And when the time comes to rob and flee he has too much manhood to break the loving mother's heart. The surprise comes when it is revealed that the man the Kid killed in Texas was the real son.","popularity":0.3725,"poster_path":"/T37E38jnD0cyW6E5Hx9Lww4NwL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Llando Kid Was Known As the Meanest Gun Fighter in Texas.
