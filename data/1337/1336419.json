Mitchell cites the 2014 killing of Tamir Rice = a twelve-year-old boy who was shot by a Cleveland police office while playing outside with a toy pellet gun - as an urge call to action. Highlighting lighthearted activates that many people take for granted, Idyllic Space is a compelling reminder that Black people have historically been denied these moments of leisure, play and delight.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idyllic Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4895565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Mitchell","original_name":"Tyler Mitchell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c46454d2033884581acb52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"@ HIGH Museum of Art (Atlanta)","release_date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
