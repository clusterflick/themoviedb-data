After the end of the war in Cyprus in 1974, the post-colonial Greek governments discredited the Greek soldiers and officers who took part in the war, and were hostile towards them. The same behavior happened to the relatives of the missing, who did not stop looking for their loved ones and demanding explanations from the Greek state about the fate of their loved ones. In the end, victims of the war in Cyprus are not only those who died on the battlefield, but also those who managed to return home. For all of them, time stopped on July 20, 1974.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jKewhrNiAWVjmhCKF7QBTgMUfg6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frozen Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Pagomenos hronos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4896022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilias Iosifidis","original_name":"Ilias Iosifidis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c4b9ead3be9a2c82d5a901","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4896022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilias Iosifidis","original_name":"Ilias Iosifidis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c4ba46348aeb4d200ba3a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2299497","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jKewhrNiAWVjmhCKF7QBTgMUfg6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2012-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
