Like most such manufacturers, it is based in Japan. Using lenses manufactured by the factory, Young filmed their female employees as they performed their usual tasks on the production, assembly and testing process. No men are featured, and while the piece alludes to the genres of documentary or corporate video, it was filmed and edited to suggest a speculative fiction: a lensmaking factory run (and perhaps owned) by women.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/h0BgNKjgmyzr4XKTUdu0Ka5xLed.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vision Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4894565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carey Young","original_name":"Carey Young","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c380ee4b12fbe89cada2b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h0BgNKjgmyzr4XKTUdu0Ka5xLed.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
