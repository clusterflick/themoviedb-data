Lal is forced to stay at the deceased mother's house with her child (Iren) for a while to host guests and clean the house. Due to the stress of the situation, Iren is unable to speak (selective mutism/temporary mutism). Lal becomes overly protective of her daughter due to her mutism. Her greatest fear is leaving more wounds with her death than she did while alive. Already afraid of leaving permanent marks, Lal cannot remove the stain left on the wooden floor where her mother died and becomes increasingly tense. In an attempt to conceal it, she covers the stain with a cabinet and tries to entertain guests this way. Meanwhile, Iren begins to hear noises coming from under the unrevealed stain. Despite Lal's efforts to protect her daughter, Iren starts to become a part of the family amid these sounds.","popularity":0.4209,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":20,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"Psychological horror","title":"M/OTHER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":4816757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"İzem Ayşegül Topal","original_name":"İzem Ayşegül Topal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5129a72dbcf40cd970aca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":4816757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"İzem Ayşegül Topal","original_name":"İzem Ayşegül Topal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c51289eee42eb770712433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15359,"name":"dead woman"},{"id":176096,"name":"generational"},{"id":194998,"name":"curious"},{"id":208251,"name":"nervous"},{"id":224845,"name":"psychological disorders"},{"id":237447,"name":"manipulated woman"},{"id":237460,"name":"manipulative woman"},{"id":251667,"name":"anxious"},{"id":257139,"name":"repressed trauma"},{"id":262783,"name":"traumatized child"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":295907,"name":"psychological horror"},{"id":309974,"name":"absurd"},{"id":322304,"name":"mute character"},{"id":325818,"name":"frightened"},{"id":325825,"name":"horrified"},{"id":334957,"name":"mommy issues"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"M/OTHER TEASER","key":"1000172812","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2024-08-18T23:06:26.000Z","id":"66c5126c1327b1cb8c395cd4"}]}}}
