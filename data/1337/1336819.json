This film traces the homecoming of Bosnian-American artist Aida Sehovic and her participatory, nomadic monument to the Srebrenica Genocide. With the monument coming to its final resting place after traveling the world for 15 years, those who remain gather at the site of the atrocities to fill thousands of small ceramic coffee cups in memory of the victims. As they collectively mourn, painful questions endure: What does \"never again\" mean in a world where perpetrators live with impunity? How do art and empathy help fill the void left by immeasurable loss and trauma?","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/rUPk6ZbxIU2wuILblOxYEWs0A9R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pinch
