Commissioned for the 2021 Kaunas Biennial. An archetypal cast of characters: Archangel, White Witch, Bat, Devil, Crone and “Warbanks”- a financier who looks suspiciously like Andy Warhol – shape-shift through negotiation, trickery, and transformative exchange: trading hope and transmitting threat between them. Identity slips as morality slides. Violence begets grief, but experience offers the choice of wisdom. Will the Archangel claim it? A cautionary tale about greyscale, The Trampled Devil embodies the ethical ambiguity of our species: suggesting that only through vigilance and an honest heart might we hope to keep our inner devils pinned beneath our better natures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ptZI0lJYaVza2atIZz1GqWFZWyo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Identity slips as morality slides","title":"The Trampled Devil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shary Boyle","original_name":"Shary Boyle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Archangel, White Witch, Bat, Devil, Crone and “Warbanks”","credit_id":"66c5333bef4106389724e67a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shary Boyle","original_name":"Shary Boyle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5334e6920e7475c24ea79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896764,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Price","original_name":"John Price","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c53371afa254b816d5b844","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ehsan Gharib","original_name":"Ehsan Gharib","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c533ba6920e7475c24eb30","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896766,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steven Lambke","original_name":"Steven Lambke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c533ef4b12fbe89cadd029","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1274,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ptZI0lJYaVza2atIZz1GqWFZWyo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Trampled Devil","key":"a0mMBrr-IK8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-18T18:24:08.000Z","id":"66c535c98ba67ca8d71cd01d"}]}}}
