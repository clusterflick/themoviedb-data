The fox disguises himself as a real chicken (albeit, a real big chicken)and then convinces the dog he is a rightful member of the chick-clan and deserves to roost amongst them. But his costume if torn off revealing his true identity and the dog levels his shotgun at the fox. The fox manages to get the dog on the receiving end of the weapon, but one of the roosters kills them both so he can get some sleep.","popularity":0.0751,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1947-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fowl Brawl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Swift","original_name":"Howard Swift","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c60b1646dc927c7dd1352d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785866,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cal Howard","original_name":"Cal Howard","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c60b228f8486a44fd07b99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150622","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
