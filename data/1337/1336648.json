It was a piece of GDR childhood,“ says filmmaker Anne Berrini, who grew up in Dessau, in her partly autobiographical documentary. In 2005, she went in search of photographers Grete Stern and Horacio Coppola, who once met at the Bauhaus. She followed their traces from Germany to Argentina to New York and interviewed friends, relatives, artists and scientists. Whether Buenos Aires, the female psyche or marginalized indigenous peoples – the view of the artist couple was new, avant-garde, provocative. From the role model of women to emigration from Europe to the New World – on her journey, the filmmaker questions perspectives of the past and the present.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tras los pasos de Grete Stern y Horacio Coppola","title":"Vom Bauhaus nach Argentinien","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"FROM BAUHAUS TO ARGENTINA","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4002033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Facio","original_name":"Sara Facio","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/5Ay65FGD9xInF6aQXa2y9N7ccaL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50abbd5b57b7a96395cc4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4196255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyula Kosice","original_name":"Gyula Kosice","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50ac8af3e2b4c36adc927","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raquel Peralta Ramos","original_name":"Raquel Peralta Ramos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50adca44cf74b22a59101","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Helft","original_name":"Jorge Helft","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50ae98737001d53395d8c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2427886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Priamo","original_name":"Luis Priamo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ogvcbQojQOMtS1rJHwUNCsuJvUZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50af3256c20244a712585","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodolfo Schenone","original_name":"Rodolfo Schenone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50afe79fa16a2bcd18fe7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4252195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Giordano","original_name":"Mariana Giordano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50b08d3be9a2c82d5ac0c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susana Colazo","original_name":"Susana Colazo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50b11c8fad0d2505ea2a0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Geyer","original_name":"Andrea Geyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50b1db34bdc8c42d5ab4e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Meister","original_name":"Sara Meister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50b27fa382cd66ad18faf","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxana Marcoci","original_name":"Roxana Marcoci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"66c50b32d0ac0d6ff72d2d18","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287534,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Berrini","original_name":"Anne Berrini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c509e571c9482555af3a27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287534,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Berrini","original_name":"Anne Berrini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c509b851395eadfa7121cf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287534,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Berrini","original_name":"Anne Berrini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c508c086030382cf24dd73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287534,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Berrini","original_name":"Anne Berrini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c509cbf7f98729c2d1900e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33186596","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
