However, he gradually realized that this was not what he wanted, but due to his personality and the family atmosphere, he found it difficult to talk to his family about it. One rainy night, Ah-Hui had an accident, and three souls detached from his body. Each soul had its own consciousness, but only one of them wanted to wake up. Meanwhile, the other two souls, existing in different spaces, discovered the regrets they had in their past lives. Unsure if they could make amends, their thoughts gradually began to change.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying For","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2351942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hsia Teng Hung","original_name":"夏騰宏","popularity":0.3448,"profile_path":"/tvL3PVWZ8uJNGTax9oDP7ee0moc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66c3528f46dc927c7dd0e5e5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4894268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Wei","original_name":"Stephanie Wei","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c352a57f8e93137ed3673e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taoyuan Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
