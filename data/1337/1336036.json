Also, it reflects the living style of people who live in Da-chih village. Over the labor, activities and conversations between the villagers, we can observe the relations between people and the natural environment. The film tries to illustrate the feelings of changing and remaining with long takes. Besides, the ecology and evolution of the old abandoned houses present the trace and texture of time and space, people and memories. Lifeless as they seem to be, they imply great power.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea Breeze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4894214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Shiang-Wei","original_name":"Chen Shiang-Wei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c34a1bb9b2b73959d0e571","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taoyuan Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
