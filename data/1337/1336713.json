A line that separates the sea from the sky, mountainous waves that cut across the sky. Regardless of where you are, these limits follow the same pattern. This film proposes as a starting point the use of these limits to create a sort of landscape collage, to reconstruct the image of the landscape by combining space and time from the capture of the image; from the present, and not from the subsequent construction in post-production, hence the key role of the analogue image.
