Through narration and character-driven storytelling, the film examines how economic pressure, family circumstances, and social structures push children into work as education gradually recedes. The film presents an intimate portrait of childhood shaped by necessity, raising questions about responsibility, visibility, and the systems that allow such labor to persist.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1GuIcaQXFMvmp8Vnc7NfnoVjhbX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":288954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Muhammad Mehdi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"}],"release_date":"2025-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An short documentary exploring the grueling cycle of child labor in Pakistan through the story of two children, one working at a brick kiln and the other at a car mechanic shop.","title":"Dreams in Dust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fazal Hameed","original_name":"Fazal Hameed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"698be630dbc963ae81a61318","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murtaza Ahmed","original_name":"Murtaza Ahmed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"698be64833c7f40b06a6141c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irum Mumtaz","original_name":"Irum Mumtaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"698be65135056061cfd3a5e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeeshan","original_name":"Zeeshan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"698be659dbc963ae81a61324","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhammad Mehdi","original_name":"Muhammad Mehdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698be67763b21e91c6a613ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000148,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ali Maisam","original_name":"Ali Maisam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698be6a8a2c8b48822d3a568","department":"Production","job":"Location Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Haider Rizvi","original_name":"Haider Rizvi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698be75bdbea3895d867e779","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhammad Mehdi","original_name":"Muhammad Mehdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698be89331419b0512d54054","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36594456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1382,"name":"factory"},{"id":714,"name":"child labour"},{"id":3296,"name":"car mechanic"},{"id":7021,"name":"pakistan"},{"id":12987,"name":"poverty"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":33587,"name":"child labor"},{"id":154954,"name":"social injustice"},{"id":207818,"name":"brick making"},{"id":293896,"name":"right to education"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
