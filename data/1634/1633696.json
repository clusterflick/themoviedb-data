Cassandra has spent years researching WW's identity and has successfully figured it out. Surprising Diana at her home, Cassandra reveals her newfound information concerning Wonder Woman's identity, and then blackmails Diana to come with her to save Miriam's life. Diana has no choice. Cassandra wastes no time and calls for WW to appear. Diana concedes and Cassandra moves ahead with her plan, explaining to Wonder Woman that she and her 4 associates, all ex-cons that WW locked up, are going to do whatever the hell they want to WW for the next 24 hours. Cassandra further explains that the impending humiliating defeat will all be filmed, and if WW chooses to go to the authorities after the fact, the tapes will be released.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1542255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Williams","original_name":"Blair Williams","popularity":31.63,"profile_path":"/fEvqJbPTCXLScNeFXkDh1IVqtHf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Diana/Wonder Woman","credit_id":"698d3d7fb7f900d62c3d8598","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d3da8e47f13b35ae9f83d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d3db7f250e4031778d8eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
