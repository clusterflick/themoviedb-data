Dr. Chronic has injected her with a very powerful and potentially life threatening serum called \"The Madness\". In her semi-psychotic state, she imagines Agent Black attacking her, even though they are in fact on the same side. She doesn't understand the meaning of the attack and finds herself losing time as she flashes through different physical perils and eventually is KO'd AOH. Dr. Chronic is aware of Solaria's current mental state, and eventually puts her out on the street to fend for herself. Chronic knows Solaria's hours are finite as the Madness will eventually consume her. Somehow, Solaria collects herself and finds her way home, only to be greeted by the real Agent Black.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madness The Aftermath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1542255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Williams","original_name":"Blair Williams","popularity":31.63,"profile_path":"/fEvqJbPTCXLScNeFXkDh1IVqtHf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Solaria","credit_id":"698d3f2cb7f900d62c3d85b8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d3f39076431630afb1f36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d3f496eef26c2d63d85b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
