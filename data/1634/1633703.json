Raven had mentioned \"The Party\" wasn't until tomorrow, and tomorrow is now today. While Solaria doesn't know what's happening yet or why she's still being detained, Raven sparks a confrontation, seemingly pissed for not being a part of the action the night prior. While she's at full strength, her powers are still nonexistent. Raven mentions a dampening field within the broadcast facility, but Solaria doesn't care. She challenges Raven to take her and Raven lets her out.  Still recovering from what just happened, Solaria doesn't hear the villain with the chloro rag behind her.  She wakes later to find out it's moments before a gladiator style contest. It seems 3 villains have paid money to engage in combat with only one rule: No powers.
