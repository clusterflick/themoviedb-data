Filmed on June 19, 2023, at a sold-out Zepp DiverCity Tokyo, this concert film showcases the 6-piece ensemble—led by the twin-vocal powerhouse of Shintaro Namioka and Maho Oshima—delivering a sophisticated blend of funk, R&B, and J-Pop.  The performance is elevated by a massive 16-member super-ensemble, featuring a brass horn section and a guest gospel choir exclusive to the Tokyo show. Fans are treated to the band’s signature \"Cateen’s Time,\" a virtuoso segment spotlighting world-renowned pianist Hayato Sumino (aka Cateen) in intimate vocal-and-piano arrangements. From high-energy grooves like \"Jukebox Driver\" to the soulful heights of \"Live in This Way,\" the film offers a definitive look at Penthouse’s evolution from University of Tokyo alumni to major-label stars.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uSoNszv3x1ojoyMUagVO2LyFgyl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penthouse ONE MAN LIVE TOUR “Balcony” at Zepp DiverCity [TOKYO]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shintaro Namioka","original_name":"Shintaro Namioka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Vocal & Guitar","credit_id":"698befeee3c74010fe7be40f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maho Oshima","original_name":"Maho Oshima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Vocal","credit_id":"698bf004a005e107e57be469","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsunori Hirai","original_name":"Tatsunori Hirai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"698bf01b8d54aa1e72d5412c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takuma Ohara","original_name":"Takuma Ohara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"698bf03aa2c8b48822d3a57b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shintaro Yano","original_name":"Shintaro Yano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"698bf05a6fe418720d885dfb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6000200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayato Sumino","original_name":"Hayato Sumino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Piano & Moog","credit_id":"698bf07e374088b2d1885cd3","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2560,"iso_3166_1":"JP","iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/uSoNszv3x1ojoyMUagVO2LyFgyl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1811}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":198299,"name":"live music"},{"id":202519,"name":"j-pop"},{"id":367456,"name":"city pop"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
