Koya in Wakayama prefecture, Japan. He is headed towards one of the many sacred gates/temples that are there. Misdirected by a local postman, the priest is sent straying off of the main road and onto the back roads which lead to a small secluded cottage. There he meets a beautiful but bewitching woman whose raw sexuality seems utterly impossible to resist. The woman subjects the priest to numerous carnal temptations in the hopes of breaking his sacred vows of celibacy. Over the next days, the priest's will is put to the test until eventually it breaks. His faith shattered, the priest goes mad when he discovers that the temptress that seduced him was the tortured spirit of a young woman who died horrifically with her lover in the Hiroshima atomic bomb attack.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6ATyJ3zI5cgUKS0BpW6cieNDJYW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Koya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Koya Hijiri","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3157406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanako Dodaigo","original_name":"Hanako Dodaigo","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"698c6f89a61771745ff7b90d","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3157407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Kitabayashi","original_name":"Ken Kitabayashi","popularity":0.114,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"698c6f9ca61771745ff7b912","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taiji Tonoyama","original_name":"殿山泰司","popularity":1.4829,"profile_path":"/k88bvJ91SiL2Nn6QtQf7hB8U4iv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"698c6fb79e58da271009c2e3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1028527,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetsuji Takechi","original_name":"武智鉄二","popularity":0.4502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698c7013aefdbf1d4bd54342","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1028527,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetsuji Takechi","original_name":"武智鉄二","popularity":0.4502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698c701a022842996509c3bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137498,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Izumi Kyōka","original_name":"泉鏡花","popularity":1.935,"profile_path":"/9bVVAb1edyJzxx6qsWmwgHWQdny.jpg","credit_id":"698c70292a1c6126e7886118","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1774439","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1289,"iso_3166_1":"JP","iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/6ATyJ3zI5cgUKS0BpW6cieNDJYW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":859}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282903,"name":"unsimulated sex"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
