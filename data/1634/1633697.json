Growing up as an orphan, she never knew her real parents or her origins. While out patrolling her usual beat, she comes across a stranger who calls her by name. Soon he's engaged her in a fight, claiming he's testing her. She holds her own, having learned her survival skills on the streets. She grills him for information, but instead of answering he disappears. As if that mystery wasn't enough, a voice contacts her shortly thereafter asking her, \"Wanna play little Birdie\"? She doesn't know why, but she knows exactly how to track down this mystery voice. Soon she'll have answers to all of her questions, but will a young orphan be able to handle the evil she's about to encounter?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Redwing III","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1542255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Williams","original_name":"Blair Williams","popularity":31.63,"profile_path":"/fEvqJbPTCXLScNeFXkDh1IVqtHf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Redwing","credit_id":"698d3e48992d80ba3a78d8bb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d3e55d171e7f1606cf128","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d3e6113cd953ea23d85bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
