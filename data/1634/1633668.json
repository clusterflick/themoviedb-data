Restricted to few roles, often unnamed, these women have rarely received credit fo their artistry and accomplishments. Glamorous film clips, photographs, and dancers' own vivid recollections provide a dynamic portrait of veteran women hoofers prominent during the golden age of swing and rhythm tap. Three featured artists, Edith 'Baby Edwards' Hunt, Hortense Allen Jordan and Libby Spencer, reflect on their decades-long careers. They also show that they still have what it takes, joining with a cast of more than 40 to produce a show that gives today's audiences a sense of what tap dance is all about.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plenty of Good Women Dancers: African American Women Hoofers from Philadelphia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
