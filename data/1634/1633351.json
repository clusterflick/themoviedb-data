The six quartets Opus 18 show the composer’s mastery of the classical form. In contrast, the five middle quartets burst this form, with a very free treatment of the instruments and their development. Most profoundly and spiritual, the late quartets went far beyond what people were ready to hear at that time and are still intellectually challenging. The Belcea Quartet is well-known for its dynamic and compelling interpretations. The Quartet embarked on the complete cycle of Beethoven string quartets, playing the whole program within twelve days and brings a freshness to their interpretation of Beethoven’s string quartets, and draws forth a great range of colours, from sweetness to strength, from solemnity to impetuous force. Including the documentary \"On the Paths of the Beethoven String Quartets\", directed by Jean Claude Mocik.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/k9egCEvpSLdOhfxpUhJPnUR3PdN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":567,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belcea Quartet - Beethoven : The Complete String Quartets Nos. 1-16","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corina Belcea","original_name":"Corina Belcea","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"698c844772d559bd0767eb4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Schacher","original_name":"Axel Schacher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"698c8455689e773e0cd543e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krzysztof Chorzelski","original_name":"Krzysztof Chorzelski","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"698c8467022842996509c410","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Lederlin","original_name":"Antoine Lederlin","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"698c8479ee26aa6480f7b861","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1418,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k9egCEvpSLdOhfxpUhJPnUR3PdN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
