In this film you are reading these images as you would words, yet the meaning of these sentences are abstracted. This film is about process, yet an artifact exists: the paper roll. You come away with a sense that the paper rolls exist outside the film as sculpture in their own right and in turn are a manifestation, a reference back to an actual strip of film, unprojected.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qeAFJradFu0CWfEyasmIQpx15hM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roll Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Taylor","original_name":"Neil Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698bbf72ee26aa6480f7b3e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12717868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qeAFJradFu0CWfEyasmIQpx15hM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
