Having breathed the gas for an unknown number of days, the effects have left her noticeably powerless. She immediately seeks an escape but the guard on duty puts a stop to any escape plans by knocking her unconscious.  He figures the effects of the green gas will leave her with the strength of a normal girl. Although not at full strength, she still takes care of the guard quickly and runs into the halls of the complex seeking an escape route. The guard sounds the escape alarm, and in her haste, Solaria finds herself in a walled off courtyard. In response to the alarm, 2 powerful villainesses are already waiting for her. The effects of the gas aren't going away quickly, and flight, laser eyes or super breathe don't seem to be options. With that she's forced to engage the two villainesses with her remaining strength in a fight for survival.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solaria Captured","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1542255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Williams","original_name":"Blair Williams","popularity":31.63,"profile_path":"/fEvqJbPTCXLScNeFXkDh1IVqtHf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Solaria","credit_id":"698d42bd6591370b07eabd0f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d42ca24f7a03e57fb1e71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698d42d69da622efae6cf065","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
