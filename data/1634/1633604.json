The programme followed Nick Knowles, Patrick Kielty and Victoria Beckham on extraordinary journeys through Zambia, India and Peru. Their experiences highlighted where the money raised by Sport Relief was being put to work. The presenters joined three children to experience everyday life in three areas the charity is battling to help. Victoria travelled to Peru to meet 11-year-old Dinah - who lives and works on a rubbish tip. Of the 250,000 children working in Peru's capital, Lima, 80% are under the age of 12. In rural areas the situation is no better, with a huge 62% of school-aged children suffering from malnutrition. Victoria met Dinah, who is 11 years old. Dinah's mum died three years ago and she lives and works with her dad on a rubbish tip.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jBPRnACBuMRRAO88LPN2nzEi89m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":158225,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Open University Production Centre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mile in Their Shoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Beckham","original_name":"Victoria Beckham","popularity":0.711,"profile_path":"/eYJNcB1aAwhEVMGB5qcZtZOcvxM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698d033c6d52e90cfbec18f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Kielty","original_name":"Patrick Kielty","popularity":1.1842,"profile_path":"/maczg3drzP6RVvZddESjj8NwjBr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698d034b3efdbae995b69bd6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Knowles","original_name":"Nick Knowles","popularity":0.7187,"profile_path":"/lznRdWuLYGln6rW7Nreq0XQMRvj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698d035be0577a4e5d6ef43b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Beckham","original_name":"David Beckham","popularity":3.2129,"profile_path":"/9MOY95jds58WtvEwUTYZgXlTVr0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698d0406914b9d64e9ec1946","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0416981","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1254,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jBPRnACBuMRRAO88LPN2nzEi89m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":836}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
