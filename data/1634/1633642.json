Now passing the days as ushers in a fading London indie cinema, they cling to the place as it edges toward closure. On the cinema’s final night, a half-serious wish to be part of the movies lands them inside the screen itself. Swept through a series of classic film worlds, they slip into shifting roles as spies, period protagonists, and something far more monstrous, while forces outside the frame race to bring them back. Filmed at London’s Phoenix Cinema, Movie Magic is a playful, self-aware romantic comedy that celebrates cinema as both escape and obsession.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hgrw9qRgPlfpnVkoJ6j0UrMIpav.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lemon Fresh
