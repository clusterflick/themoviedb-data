A documentary about the creative process of the last 5 years of the artist Emilio García Wehbi, a series of fictional scenes that dialogue with his work and a kind of essay on the body.  In this sense, the staging is situated in the fragment, not only in the fragments of Wehbi's works, but also in the fragments of the bodies that make up those works.  Thus, a little adrift and with a puzzle structure, in \"The wound and the knife\" I manifest a constant will to jump into the void, in this way the film denies itself as a closed work, but rather, what what it tries to be is a draft, the single notes that survived my own process.","popularity":0.2802,"poster_path":"/jahpg4KdAUUGqa8SmspTS58itX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ojo Blindado","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2019-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wound and the Knife (Notes for a Film About García Wehbi)","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maricel Álvarez","original_name":"Maricel Álvarez","popularity":0.1364,"profile_path":"/adBl4J8XL9GGaLLTLl0SpivOsLM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1c7fcb0e597b0035363633","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Garcia Wehbi","original_name":"Emilio Garcia Wehbi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1c7fe76840cc00389d2134","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabo Ferro","original_name":"Gabo Ferro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1c7ff26840cc00389d2141","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Zeballos","original_name":"Miguel Zeballos","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1c80e166a7c3003803a47a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890859,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martín Loiacono","original_name":"Martín Loiacono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d84decc7e80041d29b4e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Zeballos","original_name":"Miguel Zeballos","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d81de9c0dc003d5c68e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Zeballos","original_name":"Miguel Zeballos","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d812ecc7e80041d29a7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2127323,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mirella Hoijman","original_name":"Mirella Hoijman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d882091e62004058ac8b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Gugliotta","original_name":"Sandra Gugliotta","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/401TChfSUrePPF5uRSySPda06VG.jpg","credit_id":"5fd4d8a6e9c0dc003f5c3e78","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Gugliotta","original_name":"Sandra Gugliotta","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/401TChfSUrePPF5uRSySPda06VG.jpg","credit_id":"5fd4d89874507d003f5b16d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luís Mirás Vega","original_name":"Luís Mirás Vega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d804dd47e10040a96126","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890862,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valentina Flynn","original_name":"Valentina Flynn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d867ecc7e8003ed29f1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890856,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tamara Ajzensztat","original_name":"Tamara Ajzensztat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d7e9ecc7e80041d299fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Zeballos","original_name":"Miguel Zeballos","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4d832e9c0dc003d5c6938","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10439512","wikidata_id":"Q106582595","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jahpg4KdAUUGqa8SmspTS58itX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish;
