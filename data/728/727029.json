On a personal level, he has psychological problems he treats with music. After killing his mother, he wanders through Puglia seeking his ideal woman. He encounters all sorts of people as he goes: nature-lovers, people out to find their roots, and an eccentric musician. Suddenly, Samp falls in love, not once, but serially. With women of little substance. He kills someone else and becomes almost humanâ€”and that humanity will put paid to his dreams of power.","popularity":0.13,"poster_path":"/sT1m9IokaQ1jpUGJaxfZfhmquZ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152135,"logo_path":null,"name":"RezzaMastrella","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samp","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":647181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Rezza","original_name":"Antonio Rezza","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/h9vLR0Lnz1fx341RARTJnMeSmc2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Samp","credit_id":"5f19f01fa199a60038ffb073","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1153481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flavia Mastrella","original_name":"Flavia Mastrella","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/tioPbs2YbxJHtYAfZbu7AxNRdoG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Radha","credit_id":"5f19efb0ca0e17003591eefd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915658,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Francesco Artibani","original_name":"Francesco Artibani","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61d31f2ee194b0008cf23a22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3368439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurizio Catania","original_name":"Maurizio Catania","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"61d31f3277c01f0042a392f2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3368444,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro Nardoni","original_name":"Alessandro Nardoni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d31f62e194b0001cb260a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Faonio","original_name":"Barbara Faonio","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d31f4e7b7b4d0069c915ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3368440,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eugenio Smith","original_name":"Eugenio Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d31f47944a570045b433bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3368442,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefano G.
