Then, there’s collapse and death. Shady River starts from a dark personal experience to transform in a film about the silence of women who live in men's villages. How to film where our presence is prohibited? How to record the resonances of what doesn’t sound? As the fog and smoke from the power plant cover the town, the voices of the women of Shady River force their way between the white of the ice and the hum of the drilling machines, until blowing up the structure of silence.","popularity":0.2725,"poster_path":"/nsfjLkm6JUvkWwJF8Noz2sCmGji.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antes Muerto Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Río Turbio","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Shady River","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2250386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Mazú","original_name":"Tatiana Mazú","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/w9V62SOkX9bO7BjiyGbtB2zknEd.jpg","credit_id":"614c5352e1faed0043d1e0d9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2250386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Mazú","original_name":"Tatiana Mazú","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/w9V62SOkX9bO7BjiyGbtB2zknEd.jpg","credit_id":"614c5348c7176d002da16ea4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2250386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Mazú","original_name":"Tatiana Mazú","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/w9V62SOkX9bO7BjiyGbtB2zknEd.jpg","credit_id":"5f1deb0f73520500374d9808","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848814,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sofía Mazú González","original_name":"Sofía Mazú González","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa889ba34e15200407bcb40","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848813,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florencia Azorín","original_name":"Florencia Azorín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa88974abf8e2004042472e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2808373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Embalse","original_name":"Manuel Embalse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa889a6700bf7003d5b5797","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848818,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Fridman","original_name":"Alan Fridman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa889fe700bf7003d5b5848","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julián Galay","original_name":"Julián Galay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa88960abf8e20040424718","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848816,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hernán Higa","original_name":"Hernán Higa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa889ef1d820f0042c4d024","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848815,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniela Medina Silva","original_name":"Daniela Medina Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa889d8a402c100413521c9","department":"Production","job":"Post Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848810,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sebastián Sanzottera","original_name":"Sebastián Sanzottera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa88953a402c100413520e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13416976","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":914,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nsfjLkm6JUvkWwJF8Noz2sCmGji.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
