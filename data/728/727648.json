After ripping off his boss, Eddy hightails it for Mexico, but gets distracted by a pretty hitchhiker on the way. What begins as a simple tryst ends with Eddy beaten up, broken down, and penniless in Wynot, TX. Inadvertently witnessing a murder by Willet Nash, the county's all powerful Sheriff, Eddy tries to hold up a bank and make a run for it, but his cockamamie plan goes awry and he's caught in the act by Nash himself. Eddy's only chance to make it out of jail alive is his fianc√© Jeannie, who he left jilted at the alter back in Chicago.","popularity":0.3857,"poster_path":"/mHKN3WJkaOrszkb8EvecCwXrQ68.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spring Eddy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring Eddy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Luna","original_name":"Gabriel Luna","popularity":1.5222,"profile_path":"/wZ39o38IaEJIfQglF5ovI7lO3ba.jpg","cast_id":50,"character":"Eddy","credit_id":"5f1d7f0f7352050039487cdb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1527332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verity Branco","original_name":"Verity Branco","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/wxxZaiCZjLiahYGYHk4nbpwxSwx.jpg","cast_id":51,"character":"Jeannie","credit_id":"5f1d7f2466a7c3003706c32e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blaise Miller","original_name":"Blaise Miller","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/twAl4PA4fzRNCbbDkQLSyXQWCxs.jpg","cast_id":52,"character":"H.R","credit_id":"5f1d7f3bf5f1c50036ddc54b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonny King","original_name":"Sonny King","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":"/lvMzvIwpLltNTl5YlFmF7q8l190.jpg","cast_id":53,"character":"Nash","credit_id":"5f1d7f4d4bfa540037f0ba0d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trey Cartwright","original_name":"Trey Cartwright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403ce1413654500846b7453","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722990,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Morgan","original_name":"Barbara Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d799266a7c30036034148","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2723016,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Taylor Whitbeck","original_name":"Taylor Whitbeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d7d4a735205003e4f05db","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2723002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mario Pena","original_name":"Mario Pena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d7b5673520500374c3ef3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2723004,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cody Sallee","original_name":"Cody Sallee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d7b910e597b00343c1d63","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1496962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Arnold","original_name":"Sarah Arnold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d7cc94bfa540036effc74","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2723024,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Hendrickson","original_name":"Adam Hendrickson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d7e9766a7c3003900baf5","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Anson","original_name":"George Anson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d793b66a7c3003809c101","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2723000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus Hysmith","original_name":"Marcus Hysmith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1d7addf5f1c50039e12de9","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2723008,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sarah K.
