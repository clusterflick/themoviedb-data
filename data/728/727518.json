Challenged by the illegal nature of their passions, dangerous locales, and the pressures of a society that will not accept or understand them, these artists reveal what drives them to return, time after time, to execute their artwork on a canvas that is forever changing, moving and vanishing into oblivion.  Both snapshot of a fading history and love-letter to the trains themselves, Year-round Metal Enjoyment captures the voices, faces and thoughts of artists, railfans and train-workers alike, while showcasing the unlikely beauty of the trains in their environment.","popularity":0.0997,"poster_path":"/iVxIBaUoCQPHAelwrPBiQRoNZzi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A New England freight train experience","title":"Year-round Metal Enjoyment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Griecci","original_name":"Jeff Griecci","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1ca1bd0e597b003437689b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5362688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iVxIBaUoCQPHAelwrPBiQRoNZzi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mGjFkAxo95aquBbufcBeg4QR5aZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2448,"name":"freight train"},{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":41393,"name":"new england"},{"id":309928,"name":"boxcar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
