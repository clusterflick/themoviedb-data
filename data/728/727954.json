That moment would never happen. The quintet broke up and the compositions were lost for 50 years...until they were finally recovered by Miles’ only protégé, Wallace Roney--the one man Miles would trust to fulfill his wish. As Wallace prepares to record and debut \"Universe,\" he must find a way to uphold his mentor's legacy. The work would take on an added poignancy when Wallace unexpectedly passes in March 2020 before seeing the music's release out in the world.","popularity":0.8864,"poster_path":"/frkACXVBzoWMeTGNVna2P0WYwtL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Universe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace
