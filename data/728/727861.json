The film shows how these women, different as they were in class and social background, broke taboos and dismissed conventional wisdom to fulfill their overpowering passion for filmmaking. Women Who Loved Cinema takes us to the past and brings us, seamlessly, to the present day. Aziza ... Fatema ... Behidja ... Amina ... Assia … Mary... theirs is a story that will remain indelibly etched in the memory of Egyptian cinema.","popularity":0.2989,"poster_path":"/wgDeTEZ9SSeFOvG0YQd2Qa5SEAR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11574,"logo_path":"/rgUiPgpxE7oKPFgU3GEirqAWEXx.png","name":"MISR International
