Taken from a personal perspective, the filmmaker gives a first-hand look at how his family dealt with his father’s worsening Alzheimer’s disease and eventual death, leading him to realizations about memory, familial relationships, and his own mortality. The film delves into the importance of memories in the human experience – how the ability to remember makes us feel alive, how its power can hold us, and how memory gives us what we need to feel and be human.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/eTvt19rjDgEqUlIn2siWHvEYOSC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brigade Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2020-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Elegy to Forgetting","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","title":"Elehiya sa Paglimot","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristoffer Brugada","original_name":"Kristoffer Brugada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/c56tuvc3HQ0X78MQ0DeTOYzeBnY.jpg","credit_id":"5f1f3082594c940037a4b866","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2772363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cha Escala","original_name":"Cha Escala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6570ebdbcade00381cf9fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12735332","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t4o9gJnWfGb2C40RZQDkLELh7L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eTvt19rjDgEqUlIn2siWHvEYOSC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1324,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4uunNsJWkjap3yuyWrEvg6u0o5f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":883},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1231,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wJqjDifXhyWYRnwHKzDVMGT6tWl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":827}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"An Elegy to Forgetting Trailer","key":"EYs-iLKexRI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-22T04:22:58.000Z","id":"5f6570cfaf3da6003527fcac"}]}}}
