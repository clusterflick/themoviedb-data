The architecture of the Gulbenkian auditorium in Lisbon, its colors and sense of being lost in time accompany us through a loop where a man wanders the building at night, followed by something that is not human. Through the care and paranoia with which she approaches the digital image, the artist investigates the past’s haunting of the present and the remnants of textures longing to be touched. Wardill’s work takes an interest in the appropriation of models to express ideas and the way in which fixed scenarios become exemplary. She explores the opacity of communication to deconstruct the way in which materials or the implication of the material are used to elucidate ideas.","popularity":0.0464,"poster_path":"/4c0X4uI46ZZDLH83R3SGfWeXmBL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145640,"logo_path":"/kqQKWPK8JvGmeeewRRbDtXA43xL.png","name":"Stenar
