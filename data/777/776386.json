This work is part of \"Plantarians\" which asks, what does it mean to have a garden? Apportioned into episodes, the film studies the capacity of garden plants to respond to the particularities of their surroundings. At the same time, it tracks the lives of the contemporary men and women who cultivate, enjoy, eat, obsess over, and even grieve with and for these plants. The piece invites audiences to witness the codependent existence of earthâ€™s living organisms, and to reflect on the ways in which this inter-dependence can be characterised by both conflict and intimacy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plantarians: Appendix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2895005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellie Kyungran Heo","original_name":"Ellie Kyungran Heo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8d6499408ec003ddbd212","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
