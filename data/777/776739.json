Using CGI, live-action and music, Disco Islamappropriates the aesthetics of the world of advertising and commerce in order to shed a light on issues created by the implementation of neo-liberal policies in the Middle East and the dystopian techno-capitalist solutions towards them. By juxtaposing fact and fiction throughout the film, \"Disco Islam\" ultimately pictures an apocalyptic vision of the Middle East in which the market ideology of free-trade and boundless profit-making has resulted in economic injustices, environmental catastrophes and the abandonment of the humanist project in Iran.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disco Islam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bijan Moosavi","original_name":"Bijan Moosavi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda2013cf4b8b003f9d6d98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
