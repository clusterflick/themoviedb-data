Guttormsgaard recounts his thoughts on collecting, vision, art and place to filmmaker Sam Williams at home amongst his collection in the small town of Blaker, Norway. Through snippets of dialogue and layered imagery, the film becomes a conversation between the director, Guttormsgaard and the countless objects in the collection. Guttormsgaard passed away shortly after the conversation and this touching portrait offers a unique insight into his world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wUKH0PTxYaaGLwgTJXYzv84oKGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See What I See","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Williams","original_name":"Sam Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8d185a3770a0040a62314","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wUKH0PTxYaaGLwgTJXYzv84oKGr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
