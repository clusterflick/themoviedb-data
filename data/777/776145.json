Creator of the immortal antihero warrior Kane and the author of several cerebral tales of psychological horror, Karl gave his characters and settings a unique and chilling perspective. A rugged and imposing figure who resembled his red-bearded swordsman Kane, Karl’s life ultimately ended tragically in 1994 due to the ravages of alcohol, cutting short the career of a writer who should be considered a legend in the field of weird fiction. This feature-length documentary features Karl’s family, friends, and contemporaries like Ramsey Campbell, Peter Straub, and Dennis Etchison as they explore the life of the Last Wolf, a dark genius from a bygone era who, like Kane, remains immortal through his words.","popularity":0.2176,"poster_path":"/4YZmXB6NUfBXkCsFIiCMVnUowJ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He was just a normal guy...
