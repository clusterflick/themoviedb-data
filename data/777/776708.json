Images of grand vistas and sumptuous ornamentations frame the story inspired by the many interpretations of Orpheus and Eurydike over centuries.  Flashback scenes are set in Haw Par Villa, which was built in 1937and later developed into a sculpture park with more than 1000 statues and 150 giant dioramas. Serving as a colourful backdrop in the poetic short feature, the cement life-size figures convey Chinese folk art into the modern age. The film’s protagonists stroll through a Hakka cemetery, built in 1965 on a historical burial ground, assimilating the architectural style of the adjacent HDB-buildings. Preceding scenes take place in the internationally acclaimed Hive on NTU campus, featuring the ubiquitous project’s housing with their distinct geometric details.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/A6CFzIk9vAwueaVT8dEnftGXG6k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VENOMENON [The Prospect]","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elke Reinhuber","original_name":"Elke Reinhuber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda06ab385202003ff52cea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A6CFzIk9vAwueaVT8dEnftGXG6k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
