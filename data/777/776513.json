Off the tourist map, a place still in the shadows of its past. Visitors, including scientists and conservationists, had a difficult time in the civil war-stricken country.

This is a celebration of their survival.","popularity":0.1887,"poster_path":"/cwF4Zr577UQgnawOdLNNTiQ3X5G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18407,"logo_path":"/cI9BOAZbURxD8hrbtbB4ncwZzox.png","name":"NDR Naturfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":10331,"logo_path":"/iyUmqBwQpsWOKw5uZ0j0DI5FN9t.png","name":"Terra Mater Factual Studios","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Uganda","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wildes Uganda","type":"Terra Mater title"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Uganda: Destino Secreto","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Дикая Уганда","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dörte Lyssewski","original_name":"Dörte Lyssewski","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/ueuAd47t1UfwPVKChePbIPtPMHR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"600abaf53f8ede0040614e41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":182076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Boulter","original_name":"Russell Boulter","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":"/k7PNvYr0SgK7uxO6h2dP30kYNq5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"600abb1a2a210c00409a32c0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240402,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harald Pokieser","original_name":"Harald Pokieser","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600abb28d70594003b1c8708","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240402,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harald Pokieser","original_name":"Harald Pokieser","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a731115521f83d966e8b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039396,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lee Niederkofler","original_name":"Lee Niederkofler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a732315521f83d966e8b7","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5071350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hermann Winklhofer","original_name":"Herrmann Winklhofer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a73354bf0f0e3b474979e","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5071350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hermann Winklhofer","original_name":"Herrmann Winklhofer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a73c34bf0f0e3b4749816","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2924937,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefan K.
