The film considershow they can function at extreme depths and pressure within challenging conditions such as highly acidic, high temperature, high radiation, low oxygen and methane heavy environments. Through sci-fi narratives, the film exposes non-human and multi-species perspectives, hidden networks and unheard voices. Beginning with birds-eye-view footage of the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies, the second part of the film takes a science fiction approach. The narrators develop proposals for adapting humans to livein these extreme.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/alCEcDqmLxX2Tlr8EcZcXq7ZM8s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes from the subsurface","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Tweed","original_name":"Charlie Tweed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda1e490d2f53003fb2f0f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/alCEcDqmLxX2Tlr8EcZcXq7ZM8s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EarthArt Gallery, Earth Sciences,Wills Memorial Building, University of Bristol","release_date":"2020-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
