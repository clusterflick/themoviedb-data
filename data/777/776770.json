The fiction is set in a not too distant future, in which a collective body is deciding whether to continue to exist physically, or relinquish the pain and pleasure of bodily memories, in favour of other forms of consciousness. 'did you know?' wonders what bodily memories we would keep, when we no longer need or have the bodies that generated them.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/oCI6nonM8yXuQNtzm12n7RDQoVf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"did you know?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruby Wroe","original_name":"Ruby Wroe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda29b51f3e60003eb33edb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oCI6nonM8yXuQNtzm12n7RDQoVf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hold On, The Koppel Project, London","release_date":"2020-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
