Although from distant moments in history, the protagonists are both figures indicative of ritual gathering created by Essex communities. Within the work the figures hover in cultural/historical flux, a state of simultaneous belonging and alienation as they pass through and around places seemingly suspended on the edge of conventional time and space.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/krVHCS8LplApnDqsepS27dvWXZB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(study for) Swedge of Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2896490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Forbes-Hamilton","original_name":"Richard Forbes-Hamilton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda2959c9dbf9003d7cab92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krVHCS8LplApnDqsepS27dvWXZB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/I9DavLAmm7e3Zifr1lR8RayPis.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ionian Contemporary Animation Festival","release_date":"2020-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
