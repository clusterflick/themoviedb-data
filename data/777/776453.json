In the midst of routine and alcohol, the hope of a new love arises. This is how Norma, a bar bartender, enters his life without realizing it. In Block 2, the Aristiguetas, an upper-class Venezuelan family, have moved, economically less due to the failed decisions of their father. Alejandra, the oldest of the Aristigueta children, has lived in New York for some years, ignoring the reality of her family and her country. While for Alejandra the trip back to Venezuela becomes an encounter with herself, assuming control of her family's destiny, her brother Francisco explores life in the alleys of the neighborhood.","popularity":0.049,"poster_path":"/sYIMoSSuUb89rXHNyAlfMOQ36ym.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloques","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Durán","original_name":"Pedro Durán","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6754c066f1829b66fbb4d577","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimas González","original_name":"Dimas González","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6754c085f1829b66fbb4d589","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Francia","original_name":"Carmen Francia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6754c0c566c89f44182be1c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nohely Arteaga","original_name":"Nohely Arteaga","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/81iecFlUPqerPHVd6GLUWh63Ria.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6754c0d62e4793ce964962a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Escolano","original_name":"Manuel Escolano","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6754c0e5a18cb8695afd5577","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Roschupkin","original_name":"Pavel Roschupkin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6754c0f7f1829b66fbb4d5a9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfredo Hueck","original_name":"Alfredo Hueck","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd90836226c56003d3d9cce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371775,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Caridad Montero","original_name":"Carlos Caridad Montero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd90862681888003f9ad072","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2154404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sYIMoSSuUb89rXHNyAlfMOQ36ym.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bloques","key":"HAgdRMcC38A","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-01-31T18:54:11.000Z","id":"6754c24ca18cb8695afd55c7"}]}}}
