Both help to support the household, but it is Shirley who feels the responsibility of her mother's approaching death and her worry is evident to all about her. She is employed in a manicure shop frequented by wealthy men and meets Wilfred Templeton, who invites her to dine with him. He questions her about her dejected air and she tells him of her mother's illness. This is Templeton's opportunity, and he asks her to make a bargain with him. He will give her all the money she needs and in return she is to live with him in an apartment which he will establish for her.","popularity":0.2119,"poster_path":"/cWnSWbzO45pqrCdh4Yl54vq1zOk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One of Many","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Nelson","original_name":"Frances Nelson","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":"/eV60uGS5Kz5G0oDYSoyFw8m4NU0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Shirley Bryson","credit_id":"5fda3ce90d2f530041b3cbe6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niles Welch","original_name":"Niles Welch","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/tJnAKEZX2bwKtgfnGCFvNLrW0Qg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harold Templeton","credit_id":"5fda3cf5cf4b8b003d9ef9d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Mersch","original_name":"Mary Mersch","popularity":0.1052,"profile_path":"/afqolJzTAr3LBXQU4E8koHzww5n.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Emma Bryson","credit_id":"5fda3cfd1f3e60003eb36205","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Entwistle","original_name":"Harold Entwistle","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Wilfred Templeton","credit_id":"5fda3d049408ec003cde642c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dix","original_name":"Richard Dix","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/ptVgXv2JS1MoXU6Ok0aScPIY04I.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"James Lowery - Butler","credit_id":"5fda3d0a9408ec003dde04ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Worden","original_name":"Walter Worden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"5fda3d139408ec003fdd89cf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adella Barker","original_name":"Adella Barker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Landlady","credit_id":"5fda3d1bcf4b8b003d9ef9f4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2214496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Harris","original_name":"Caroline Harris","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Bryson","credit_id":"5fda3d8ecf4b8b003f9d9728","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","credit_id":"5fda3dab1d3143003bbfa5ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896584,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur James","original_name":"Arthur James","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda3de1226c5600403eff0e","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364445,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William Fildew","original_name":"William Fildew","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda3dd71d3143003dbdf0e4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896584,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur James","original_name":"Arthur James","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda3dcc283ed9003e1de9c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","credit_id":"5fda3d9c68188800419df11f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008391","wikidata_id":"Q25218397","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":914,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cWnSWbzO45pqrCdh4Yl54vq1zOk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":609}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
