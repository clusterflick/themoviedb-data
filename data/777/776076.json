Her own memories play out in front of her eyes all over the city. At the local coffin store, she has to face a choice – a coffin or an old sledge. She says her goodbyes and takes off towards the nearby forest.\r It isn’t easy to make death charming and almost jovial, but director Rene Turtledove accomplishes it in this animation short about an elderly woman who has buried one too many friends and decides there are better ways to spend her money and her time than on the local coffin shop.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/fNg4thlSI2TOcnetUbDgZqbR2jA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animācijas Brigāde","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Esperance of Will","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reinis Ūbelis","original_name":"Reinis Ūbelis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b58f1f3e60003db0f3d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reinis Ūbelis","original_name":"Reinis Ūbelis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b5acdb952d00407dba25","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reinis Ūbelis","original_name":"Reinis Ūbelis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b5b669d28000403d2f37","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893650,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dzintars Krūmiņš","original_name":"Dzintars Krūmiņš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b5d13a340b003f5c530a","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820723,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elvijs Menniks","original_name":"Elvijs Menniks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b60069d28000433cf3f6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398274,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normunds Deinats","original_name":"Normunds Deinats","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b615cf4b8b00429a90f9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893651,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zane Veremeja","original_name":"Zane Veremeja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b62869d28000433cf4ad","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Māris Putniņš","original_name":"Māris Putniņš","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd7b63cd8e22500411c71b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28863425","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":965,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fNg4thlSI2TOcnetUbDgZqbR2jA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":681}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Esperance Of Will /Cerība dzīvot trailer","key":"GLJUX3OFFoI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-12T11:06:32.000Z","id":"6611cc741fa1c80163d1db91"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"The Esperance of will\" director Rene Turtledove","key":"447076195","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-12T08:45:06.000Z","id":"5fd7b431db952d003f7df674"}]}}}
