Hanging the dagger on the wall. Jack goes out. For some time Jack has discerned a coolness in his wife, and his jealous misgivings were verified when he returned and found her in company with a stranger. Seizing the dagger from the wall he chases the recreant lover from the house and then follows the wife to the bathroom, wither she has flown in terror. Mercilessly he plunges the dagger and flies the place. The lover in hiding sees him leave and returns, and calling aid succeeds in reviving the wife, who afterwards with careful treatment recovers and marries her paramour. However, either from the baneful influence of this diabolical dagger, or the woman's capricious nature, just one year later the second husband enacts the same scene, but with fatal results.","popularity":0.1652,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1909-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hindoo Dagger","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Solter","original_name":"Harry Solter","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/2HWWlgqD4xYKZNwiSaD2BqPyAY2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Windom","credit_id":"5fd7db3c681888004199b904","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"5fd7db49cf4b8b00429ac7d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur V.
