One autumn morning he is sitting on the riverbank in a favourite place where he used to fish with his godson. Suddenly he notices the figure of a shapely semi-naked girl emerging from the fog. She is shivering with cold. Alex spontaneously offers his help, and thus becomes part of an incredible adventure story.","popularity":0.9366,"poster_path":"/phiEwmCVUwZvCAGfSMdR9OXRLpW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Idas Film","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":131386,"logo_path":"/7hbMW4N2YRj15Ytk4wCjpJ9WRWw.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of Ukraine","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Here.
