The same area is also the location of no. 5 and no. 7 Darnley Road, where the filmmaker (and several other friends) used to live around 2007.  The wonders of the plants which once grew there and the love shared amongst friends (in the same place but later in time) fused into an idea of Paradise, which was amplified by the strange stillness of those spring months of 2020.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3e26vHs8Oaltqt9PnzcjyIju99G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Field (Flowers and)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Östlund","original_name":"Pia Östlund","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5fd8cb29a127e5004214b13a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Östlund","original_name":"Pia Östlund","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8cb151d3143003ebbabd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1610,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3e26vHs8Oaltqt9PnzcjyIju99G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1073}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
