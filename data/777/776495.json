The film explores life of artist, by following theatre director’s Mara Kimele's fighting relationships with her despotic grandmother Anna Lacis (widely known as Asya, whose life is closely tied to the names of Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brech), cynical son Peteris (who is played by an actor) and work while she stages  F. Dostoevsky's “Crime and Punishment”. Every character of film is an act. But does that make them any less real? And what is real in the world of art? Apart from its human character's, the film also has an animated one – the horse, who came into life through the first letter Mara wrote to her grand mother and has been following her ever since.","popularity":0.2054,"poster_path":"/bm4oziZ2PObNwqOtFt7pguPFVJ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nomadi","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Māra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1893939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Māra
