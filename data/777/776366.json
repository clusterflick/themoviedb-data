It explores ideas behind the theme of insomnia. Filmed after dark, the multiple layering of images and sound draws the viewer into the unsettling emotional world of the insomniac. The soundtrack is made from recordings of a beautiful dawn chorus that has been slowed down and reversed to create a wakeful nightmarish lullaby. The hand painted video stills create a further dimension, taking the painterly process in the film making off the screen, back on to paper and reworked using oil paint.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Lorens","original_name":"Amanda Lorens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8ce65a3770a003fa69071","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
