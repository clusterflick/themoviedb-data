Three soldiers are arrested as Catholics and condemned to die. Cromwell decides to spare two of them and to determine which should die by chance. The guards bring the first child they meet. Whichever soldier she gives the 'death disc' to shall die. Cromwell is charmed by the girl and gives her his signet ring. By chance the child is the daughter of one of the soldiers and gives the death disc to her father, because she thinks it's pretty. The child is returned home to her mother, who learns of her husband's pending execution and of the power of the ring. She rushes to the place of execution and saves her husband by producing the ring.","popularity":1.4742,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1909-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death Disc: A Story of the Cromwellian Period","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Nichols","original_name":"George Nichols","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/ghGlmpjdUDRShrGZyG92sm3m5Hx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Catholic","credit_id":"5fd79c54681888003f98e0fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Catholic's Wife","credit_id":"5fd79c6562f3350040ff591c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Haldeman","original_name":"Edith Haldeman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Catholic's Child","credit_id":"5fd79c77a3770a0040a48d5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Powell","original_name":"Frank Powell","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/204pUG69Va4HRbuReZ21IEVxWMV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Oliver Cromwell","credit_id":"5fd79c8669d28000403d05f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kirkwood","original_name":"James Kirkwood","popularity":0.279,"profile_path":"/svL7O0IG1wHWXr9BUIolCWkKeeN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cromwell's Advisor","credit_id":"5fd79c986476540041552753","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65401d1d1d1bf4011e1d9621","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72225,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Twain","original_name":"Mark Twain","popularity":0.2043,"profile_path":"/lCNAIvVAyVeKOyxX7OZIqduZ0Mn.jpg","credit_id":"65402194e894a600c517a8ed","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8814,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank E.
