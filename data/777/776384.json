The mournful landscapes and whistling wind are interrupted by the blasting dystopic industrial rhythms from Glasgow’s The Modern Institute. The score mirrors Hawthorn’s defeated ego in his desperate love for a returning friend, Magnolia. Sorrowful and deeply felt, Hawthorn’s lovesickness is Romanticist in colour. The wilderness is uncaring. The water laps softly against the muddy sand, oblivious. Fat seals continue to lounge on rocks out at sea.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wADb7gwgwrikVO6udl4inYBXP87.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Hawthorn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florrie James","original_name":"Florrie James","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8d5a11d3143003cbc901c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wADb7gwgwrikVO6udl4inYBXP87.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Glasgow Short Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alchemy Film & Arts","release_date":"2021-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
