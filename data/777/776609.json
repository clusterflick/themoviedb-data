The sexual revolution happened in Latvia thanks to Māris Putniņš, an artist and soon-to-be among the most visible Latvian puppet animation specialists. In 1989, he published a series of drawings showing that babies aren’t brought by storks or found in cabbage patches in the famous children’s magazine Zīlīte. This popular-science film by Roze Stiebra recreates this long-kept-from-children truth on the big screen.","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":"/tOFCHzhFcX3xbhmwMgfLvYXzkfg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dauka","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How a Baby Comes Into the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Skapāns","original_name":"Nils Skapāns","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/nBRExiyhEvdXzGz4Au2OIgCt8Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5fd9769ea3770a003da6b88b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2263346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ansis Bērziņš","original_name":"Ansis Bērziņš","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/3sv2do4azoKwlvqzBDz6byheS9z.jpg","credit_id":"5fd9768d68188800409bf410","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1662734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roze Stiebra","original_name":"Roze Stiebra","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qNmsEUHHeuD5D9jn6ezzGdQzQh4.jpg","credit_id":"5fd9767cb0ba7e00412fcb1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2564064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tOFCHzhFcX3xbhmwMgfLvYXzkfg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":684}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
