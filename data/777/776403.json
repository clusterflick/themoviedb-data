Among the taped entries in Kubota's journal: an Amsterdam street musician/beggar, a Parisian sex cabaret, a gay theater troupe in Brussels, a ritualistic performance art piece, and a hallucinatory video trip along the Champs Elysees. The diary culminates in Kubota's homage to Marcel Duchamp at his grave in Paris.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Europe on 1/2 Inch a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shigeko Kubota","original_name":"Shigeko Kubota","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8dc87a3770a0040a6358e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
