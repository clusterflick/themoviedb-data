Her circus name is Fatima. Billy Harvey, one of the performers, and a part owner of the show, is, or rather pretends to be, in love with Fatima, and she loves him in return. The arduous duties have made the poor girl ill but her managers cruelly insist that she must appear, as she is a feature. During her dance, however, she faints from weakness, and the audience is dismissed. Amos Holden, a young merchant in the village, who is in the audience, is deeply moved by the poor girl's predicament, and determines to help her.","popularity":0.2782,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Call","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Barker","original_name":"Florence Barker","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/9UBRj7K9xRDyGkNvGxE8Jdwv22S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Edith Lawson","credit_id":"5fda62f235c30a003d64e74f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
