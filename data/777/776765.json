Human and non-human, interior and exterior co-exist in this highly improvisational yet serendipitous portrait of the forever-changing city of Seattle. Collaborating to subdivide a 16mm film frame into thirds, Caryn Cline, Linda Fenstermaker and Reed O’Beirne present their separately shot segments simultaneously within one spatial plane. From the interplay of these three points of view emerges a cinematic conversation based on a horizontal compositional logic within the shared frame. This combined connotative relationship between the subframes evokes a spectacle of fractured spatial and temporal perspective.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/xmgoS3zEDd7YEZ769pOCMUj84au.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tri-Alogue #4","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Durand","original_name":"Emily Durand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"5fde0350be2d49003f4d6f59","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reed O'Beirne","original_name":"Reed O'Beirne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda28eea3770a003ea97354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caryn Cline","original_name":"Caryn Cline","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda28f7eb14fa0040f9e233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1404508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Fenstermaker","original_name":"Linda Fenstermaker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda290068188800409ce4b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Durand","original_name":"Emily Durand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fde0359d70594003f2948a6","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900123,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rachael Cohen","original_name":"Rachael Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fde036bd70594003f2948c6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmgoS3zEDd7YEZ769pOCMUj84au.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2020-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bolton International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Local Sightings Festival","release_date":"2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tri-Alogue #4 (Trailer)","key":"366269750","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-14T15:17:07.000Z","id":"5fde033cd7107e003dc78daa"}]}}}
