Often touted as \"missing links\" between man and apes, these native peoples were harassed and demeaned. Their public display was arranged with the enthusiastic support of the most elite members of the scientific community, and it was promoted uncritically by America's leading newspapers. This award-winning documentary explores the heartbreaking story of what happened, shows how African-American ministers and other people of faith tried to push back, and reveals how some people are still drawing on Social Darwinism in order to dehumanize others. The film also explores the tragic story of eugenics in America, the effort to breed human beings on Darwinian principles.","popularity":0.1628,"poster_path":"/nUHYD2gPiKZ1oL2JpyjWiEOXhiz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human Zoos: America's Forgotten History of Scientific Racism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4194460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andres Williams","original_name":"Andres Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64cace6e706e56012d647e3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4194461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Williams III","original_name":"Ted Williams III","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64cace7ae04d8a00c61f1578","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4194463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John G.
