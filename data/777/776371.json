Purportedly representing the Red Army carrying Malevich’s ‘Black Square’, the photo allows for varying narratives, interpretations and hopes. Mingling archival footage with digital renders, \"July Days\" brings together a chorus of voices that explore what such a photo can represent in an age of fake news and virality. In the process, \"July Days\" invites its viewers along a hopeful and intimate reading of (art) history that celebrates the potential of radical imagination.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aron Rossman-Kiss","original_name":"Aron Rossman-Kiss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8d09f9408ec003edb59f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
