Unemployed, broke, and lonely - she thinks her luck may be turning when she meets the perfect man but in true-to-Karly form, accidentally scares him off. (You know, that moment when you think you've asked a man over for mac and cheese but you've accidentally propositioned him with depraved x-rated activities.) Just as she resigns herself to a life of loneliness, a tragic twist jolts her into finding the inner strength to turn her luck around.","popularity":0.3002,"poster_path":"/5d4hLjvsBHIhIwIwHNhmBvsUNFm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KY","name":"Cayman Islands"}],"release_date":"2016-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Falling in love?
