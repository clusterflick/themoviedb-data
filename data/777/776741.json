In the morning I went and made the film, asking questions without the need for an answer. When I arrived back at the beach at lunch time I swam in the sea and napped on the black sand.

This film attempts to convey the feeling.\" The film is partof the project Volcano & Regret.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/4gG1VFwGmrapktEvv4JhbDxq6nN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stromboli: Interview with a Volcano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Finlay Ramsay","original_name":"George Finlay Ramsay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fda20b2b0ba7e004031c251","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4gG1VFwGmrapktEvv4JhbDxq6nN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Volcanoes & Regret, SET Alscot Road, Bermondsey, London","release_date":"2019-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stromboli: Interview with a Volcano (trailer)","key":"487762003","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-06T11:20:06.000Z","id":"5fdcbd0e3f7e1d003f45818b"}]}}}
