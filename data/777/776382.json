This review, written in 1959 by critic and poet Edwin Denby, articulates the music and movement of a dance using an idiosyncratic stream of metaphors. \"Tha-at’s right\" takes these outlandish descriptions literally by using them as a script or score, translating the written word back into a performance. This process was realised collaboratively with the performers onscreen over the course of a day.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pnjErwPGlG3EaaQDTQ6mhsWV9D5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tha-at's right","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rowland Hill","original_name":"Rowland Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8d4fbdb952d003d7eefd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pnjErwPGlG3EaaQDTQ6mhsWV9D5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fracto","release_date":"2019-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
