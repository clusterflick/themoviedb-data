Although quite slow paced and relatively old, the documentary film successfully incorporates reconstructed film material and original Antarctic expedition footage to fully illustrate the hardships of the heroic and extreme arctic explorations.  Human endurance is tested to the maximum, as the documentary takes a look back at those who have tried, failed and conquered this most unforgiving landscape.  Some of these stories entail Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions: the Discovery expedition of 1901–1904 and the ill-fated Terra Nova expedition of 1910–1913.  Scott reached the South Pole in January 1912 only to find he had been beaten to the spot by 33 days. His entire party died on the return journey; eight months later, a search party discovered some of their bodies, diaries and photographs.","popularity":3.6605,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Actuality Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A history of human exploration in the Antarctic.","title":"Antarctica: A Frozen History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Herrmann","original_name":"Edward Herrmann","popularity":1.0067,"profile_path":"/sO9IoAlw3CLJZT6UF35cZBcTYRV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5fd921b1075288003d136f9c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895522,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Cambou","original_name":"Don Cambou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd921d06c19ea003d868ec9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Boedeker","original_name":"Jeff Boedeker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd921e6283ed9003f1cbba3","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1398397,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Thomas","original_name":"Guy Thomas","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd92254db952d003f802297","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830498,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Krajewski","original_name":"Peter Krajewski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd92267511d0900415eaf46","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168708,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dylan O'Brien","original_name":"Dylan O'Brien","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd92278cf4b8b00429cca3d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895527,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jason Steinberg","original_name":"Jason Steinberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd922a43344c6003fb12978","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389601,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gary Reid","original_name":"Gary Reid","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd922bf1d3143003dbc842d","department":"Crew","job":"Post-Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Dash","original_name":"Sean Dash","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd922d71d3143003bbdb6a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":214417,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sean Dash","original_name":"Sean Dash","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd922e09408ec003fdc1276","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0318999","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/imaf2OjDj3iGS8K04enXH5rBysl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4759,"name":"exploration"},{"id":14728,"name":"antarctica"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
