So he and Jerry get a sheriff who when they arrive at the fence suggests a constable who then suggests a cop. In between all those encounters, we see them all take the long walks to various places of which one of those-up a hanging bridge-provides some good humour when they fall down on it a couple of times. When all of the above all gather together, they walk another long distance to the other side of the fence.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/epUzc1yHUTipXVB14qGu6zGN7Sb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34878,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.R.
