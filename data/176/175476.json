The first half of this film is a blatant copy of \"Easy Street\". Pollard plays the local constable, charged with maintaining order in the tough slum district.","popularity":0.2916,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Ringside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","original_name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/srCQa37TG3RHKx5PuthzjsTpe6n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55096ea492514110ca00361a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Mosquini","original_name":"Marie Mosquini","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/wJBhBG8DX3BnUXE6tg2jbdGECKS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5fc3a36847f825d52b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d5fc3a36847f825d523","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0245730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
