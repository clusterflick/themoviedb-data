A house burns from the inside while its occupants focus on the emotional issues of their lives. The inhabitants serve life sentences with no remission in a structure of insecurity - while impending disaster is ignored. An absent minded couple sits calmly reading as fires erupt in their clothing, books and furniture. They nonchalantly swat at the flames with a stoic inattentiveness.  Burn embraces an anti-narrative structure yet intense drama is found in the work. Finally a decisive act is taken leading to the possibility of a miraculous event.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burn","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Jolley","original_name":"Patrick Jolley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d5ac3a36847f825c3df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2089119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reynold Reynolds","original_name":"Reynold Reynolds","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/sTidskr8VAI7XOXRPrw3C22LN44.jpg","credit_id":"5f1bc39f66a7c30036fda54e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0303312","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
