He eventually falls face forward. Flip opens the tent flap to reveal a lot of large animals behind him. A large animal creature-I have no idea what it is-comes out and starts to interact with Flip. Flip keeps hitting him. Flip puts his head in the animal's mouth. At one point, the animal swallows him as we see moving bumps on the stomach. He then spits him back out!","popularity":0.169,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rialto Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flip's Circus","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Winsor McCay","original_name":"Winsor McCay","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/jJh3gGWKZL8B4xWDWNAEqP6Veq5.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d5ec3a36847f825d2df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Winsor McCay","original_name":"Winsor McCay","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/jJh3gGWKZL8B4xWDWNAEqP6Veq5.jpg","credit_id":"6165bb868c40f7002a7672c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0126913","wikidata_id":"Q86928406","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":291,"name":"circus"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
