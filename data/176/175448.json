Grandon) and produced by James B. Leong, who changed his name from Leong But-jung after emigrating from Shanghai in 1913. Of the seven reels that originally comprised 'Lotus Blossom,' only one (the fifth, running for 12 minutes at 20fps) is known to survive. This remaining reel of film is now available on Disc 2 of the DVD Collection \"More Treasures from the American Film Archives,\" and was preserved by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.","popularity":0.158,"poster_path":"/8OjB1Sa4DMKJ3k5sOioqIFCaz8p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lotus Blossom","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1440226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lady Tsen Mei","original_name":"Lady Tsen Mei","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/nxt96aioxnz0GX1MBkdWILtP3ax.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6011a0ed0e597b0040379eef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tully Marshall","original_name":"Tully Marshall","popularity":0.2691,"profile_path":"/4bBj7eZ2A8LjO1HZnHipjPhLu5Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6011a0f3d7cd06003d099aad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Beery","original_name":"Noah Beery","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":"/7VGAfjnR7FkuDk33bzTGZ4rnKg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6011a0f946f3540040b55702","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Abe","original_name":"阿部豊","popularity":0.188,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6011a0ff7f1d8300416e632d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2365750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goro Kino","original_name":"Goro Kino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6011a10d7f1d8300406f0fa6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Yohalem","original_name":"George Yohalem","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6265d97cf794ad009a338c9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":288047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James B.
