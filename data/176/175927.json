The basic framework of the film is provided by intercutting of two counterposed materials. On the one hand, it uses black-and-white, endlessly accelerating and rhythmically varying images of the inexorable forward motion of the racing cars. On the other hand, it uses colourful, extreme slow-motion images  of details of a chequered flag fluttering in\r the wind. The escalating speed, growing abstraction and mosaic-like repetition of images leads on to manipulated, yet realistic images of human bodies used in crash tests. In the end, all that is left is the black-and-white flash of speed, the gyrating pulse of the mosaic, the details of the human bodies and the intense soundtrack. Routemaster has some of the qualities of a live concert.","popularity":0.1967,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":41450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crystal Eye Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Routemaster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilppo Pohjola","original_name":"Ilppo Pohjola","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d67c3a36847f825ef01","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilppo Pohjola","original_name":"Ilppo Pohjola","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d67c3a36847f825eefb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masami Akita","original_name":"Masami Akita","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5490454b9251412212001a5b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400037,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wieslaw Pogorzelski","original_name":"Wieslaw Pogorzelski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549045609251412203001a22","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0258934","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14541,"name":"crash"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
