The plot finds echoes throughout the Weimar period, including Sternberg’s The Blue Angel. Conrad Veidt appears in a supporting role as a sinister blind painter, whose entrance eerily presages Murnau’s Nosferatu. Der Gang in die Nacht, the earliest surviving film by F. W. Murnau, is also, paradoxically, the only Murnau film for which the original camera negative exists.","popularity":0.2268,"poster_path":"/p8YTVpLBJsJAUro6f42gvxig8Um.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goron Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1921-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey into the Night","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Journey Into the Night","type":"Translated Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Dark Road","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'Entrée dans la nuit","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olaf Fønss","original_name":"Olaf Fønss","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/h1LNGzDGV9oFGkjAEslI4LnO7xS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Eigil Börne","credit_id":"52fe4d5ec3a36847f825d2f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1010377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erna Morena","original_name":"Erna Morena","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/rqXp6pdBr76EP1dntK27Tv9O2Qk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helene","credit_id":"52fe4d5ec3a36847f825d2f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Veidt","original_name":"Conrad Veidt","popularity":0.4331,"profile_path":"/AkRjkTKXIUoPlczpPegaiFeg4lu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Der Maler","credit_id":"52fe4d5ec3a36847f825d2fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gudrun Bruun Stephensen","original_name":"Gudrun Bruun Stephensen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zx6F0pxOu0FWF2Rrp8sRooLapLL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lily","credit_id":"5674e15f92514179d200178b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clementine Plessner","original_name":"Clementine Plessner","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5674e16492514179dd0016ab","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"F.
