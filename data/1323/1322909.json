Now’s the time to make that dream a reality. . . virtually.  A 36-seat motion-platform VR theater is at the heart of the experience. Put on your headset, sit back in the motion seats and be immersed in a world of undersea adventure. 360º 3-D virtual reality technology transports you to the South Pacific where a marine biologist takes you on a live-action journey to the nurturing grounds of the humpback whales, where you swim side-by-side with mother humpbacks and their new-born calves. Or if excitement is on your agenda, dive with tiger sharks and great hammerheads in the turquoise waters of Tiger Beach in the Bahamas.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mW1IAkQVbAack79GfD76maI3Fqy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ocean Adventures Await","title":"Undersea Explorer VR: Shark Dive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mW1IAkQVbAack79GfD76maI3Fqy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1908}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
