Diaz, that follows a new generation of traditional outrigger canoe builders and navigators from Polowat, Central Carolines, Federated States of Micronesia, and Guam in their respective efforts to continue and resuscitate an ancient tradition of outrigger canoe carving and sailing in the late twentieth century.  Like the motif of water that flows through the documentary and blurs lines between surface and depth, and between water, land and air,  an indefatigable tradition and aesthetic of seafaring is shown to also challenge pat and problematic distinctions between past and present, tradition and modernity, indigenous and Christian religiosity and spirituality,  that prevail in conventional understandings of Micronesian culture and history.","popularity":1.0984,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"},{"id":73486,"logo_path":"/6CiuYMBxpBvuYnNTPFW7KsvNVAh.png","name":"Pacific Islanders in Communications","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Vessels: Navigating Tradition and Identity in Micronesia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vicente M.
