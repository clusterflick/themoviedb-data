Working as a masseuse and living as a social outcast following the accident, she stopped caring and believing in anything. Her life remained meaningless until the day the same genetic disease which caused her daughter to go blind started to plague her life. Without knowing the real reason, she subconsciously refused to undergo treatment. As Mu-shh gradually lost her eyesight, she started to use her sense of touch to communicate with the rest of the world. As her world grows darker, she realizes her reason for stepping into the darkness is not a means to an end, but a meaningful beginning of something new.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1089571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Lin","original_name":"Hannah Lin","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/zqw9LwRHjH0l39mTwsRPc1Y4D3u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6c6bbd5fc040176d87aa3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hsu","original_name":"John Hsu","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/9V44RlZuGx1xbaWxt5ejKJ4J1rb.jpg","credit_id":"66a6c6aa0ad812601d33c8a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hsu","original_name":"John Hsu","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/9V44RlZuGx1xbaWxt5ejKJ4J1rb.jpg","credit_id":"66a6c689540f27744d603a44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2084768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
