A doll of Sunbeam, a cute and chaotic personification of the sun invoking the trans Roman Empress Heliogabalus, is split open, remade and implanted with collected ‘resonant’ objects - a rib bone, a lock of hair, teeth, pharmaceutical hormones and a peach pit for a brain. Performed by the artist and filmed in her own bedroom and kitchen, the intimate film explores a domestic imaginary for restitching transfeminine histories, a communion with the dead and the sensual reinvention of a body with no end.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fantastic Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lou Lou Sainsbury","original_name":"Lou Lou Sainsbury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a630c2ac3ac0a7351550b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spryte","release_date":"2024-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
