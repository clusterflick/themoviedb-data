Ron and Mary discuss Ron's recent vacation and then transition to a review of recent workplace accidents. These incidents include an electrician falling due to a missing safety cone, a worker getting a shock from faulty equipment, and a drill press operator injuring his finger due to an improperly secured backup bar. They identify a common issue: the \"let George do it\" syndrome, where employees assume someone else will handle safety checks. They emphasize the importance of personal responsibility in safety practices and propose using these cases in training programs to illustrate the need for vigilance and proactive safety measures. The conversation ends with a story from Ron about a past mistake, highlighting the critical lesson of not taking safety for granted and ensuring one's own and others' safety by not relying on others to always handle safety checks.","popularity":0.2277,"poster_path":"/43LUnUfqHNnh2WZLhVDDvaES1Ex.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gilbert Altschul Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":100550,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Safety Council","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let George Do It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aDoRi26FxqwPbaS6YldW97TQB15.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/43LUnUfqHNnh2WZLhVDDvaES1Ex.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3852,"name":"safety"},{"id":283914,"name":"psa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
