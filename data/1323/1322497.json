A lot is going to happen between these two milestones which embrace a whole country (Putna-Drobeta) and ten reasons a day to abandon: the threat of bears and sheepdogs, getting lost in the night, endless races under the sun and rain, until the skin peels off, the nails fall, just like all the masks, eventually. No runner is a granted finalist. They all know that suffering is inevitable.","popularity":0.0685,"poster_path":"/gT44qsN1W9U266eqOTvlnt8Fv15.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2024-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The run of your life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corneliu Buliga","original_name":"Corneliu Buliga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6ac8276e52c86403a1677","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Hochbauer","original_name":"Eva Hochbauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6ac8a29ffe47fceb2ea9e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tibi Ușeriu","original_name":"Tibi Ușeriu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6ac93169ca97224028519","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toma Coconea","original_name":"Toma Coconea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6ac9a690ecdc2eede9b43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florin Alexandru","original_name":"Florin Alexandru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6aca517d2ca2d9265ef9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristian Deac","original_name":"Cristian Deac","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6acadad1bfcbf2f354f41","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornel Pop","original_name":"Cornel Pop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6acb46e7a79bf1f11d1b3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Pavăl","original_name":"Adrian Pavăl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6acbd82928f140eb2eac0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4854354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Vulturar","original_name":"Paul Vulturar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66a6acc3385c42ba2a777744","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3808540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mircea Gherase","original_name":"Mircea Gherase","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a6ab6a92f8ed416a40ba2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3808539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucian Mircu","original_name":"Lucian Mircu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/oskvsfVYXceOuTbc1TvDsvZhhxL.jpg","credit_id":"66a6ab6129ffe47fceb2ea92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":731,"iso_639_1":"ro","file_path":"/cDAa7ZYhqIwHJFC4EYwkNlkj34C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1110,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gT44qsN1W9U266eqOTvlnt8Fv15.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":740}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
