Adagio does not recite a ‘truth’ but aims to be a question mark, searching for a spectrum of possibilities and plausible answers. This is a piece that searches for authenticity in a world of limits and oppression and breaks through structures that society systematically places on people and bodies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adagio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4855471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stef Van Looveren","original_name":"Stef Van Looveren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a7953e2b58e7d46a661af5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
