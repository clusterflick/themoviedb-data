The documentary follows several individuals and their families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as they fight to make ends meet in the “new economy.” In sheer numbers, more jobs were created than lost in America during the last decade, but a look behind those numbers reveals a shortage of jobs that pay enough to support a family. The program intimately portrays the lives of workers and their families as they struggle to make it in today’s job market.","popularity":1.2517,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minimum Wages: The New Economy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Moyers","original_name":"Bill Moyers","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/dehFUQ0HpaZ6HxH0yCYdOuSR12Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66a5f3d8a2e2a599a86a7bea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1796730,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathleen Hughes","original_name":"Kathleen Hughes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/nHwXihE5H3DtvG2xPlaQtVJ54Mi.jpg","credit_id":"66a5f44ff68938bf76870812","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077639,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Casciato","original_name":"Tom Casciato","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pJSDknVb3kXZrg9lye7F0SUHI0D.jpg","credit_id":"66a5f245fc78d052b91f7b6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1079878,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Donna Marino","original_name":"Donna Marino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a5f30037877dc30ac64c1e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Moyers","original_name":"Bill Moyers","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/dehFUQ0HpaZ6HxH0yCYdOuSR12Y.jpg","credit_id":"66a5f45ce5384888ec6a7c02","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077639,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Casciato","original_name":"Tom Casciato","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pJSDknVb3kXZrg9lye7F0SUHI0D.jpg","credit_id":"66a5f42983e8557c0f40b8be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0481579","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3681,"name":"economy"},{"id":169213,"name":"milwaukee wisconsin"},{"id":274676,"name":"public broadcasting"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":284823,"name":"jobs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Minimum Wages","key":"33288953","site":"Vimeo","size":480,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2011-12-07T15:45:25.000Z","id":"66a5f9bd13a7868310b176a2"}]}}}
