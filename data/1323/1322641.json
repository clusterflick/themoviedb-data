Subsequently, they became finalists in the projects “Minute of Fame” on Channel One in 2007, “Britain’s Got Talent” in 2015 and “America’s Got Talent” in 2018. The film shows in detail the formation of the team and the entire behind-the-scenes life of the main characters, where, in addition to victories and performances with stars on the same stage, there were also personal dramatic moments. The story of the main characters serves as motivation for the younger generation and proves that success on the world stage can be achieved even while in a remote region of Russia.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/e2oyUxnSewUiFuC3sfghEIBBJaS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doronkin Project","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ЮДИ: Танец в темноте","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"YUDI: Tanets v temnote","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4859081,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Vakhitov","original_name":"Vladimir Vakhitov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a9e0c9882bb05680930f0b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4859080,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolay Mitkin","original_name":"Nikolay Mitkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a9e0b2c0bf8e30c9194400","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4855120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxim Bashorin","original_name":"Maxim Bashorin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a9e0dcfd1353a12e838f4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4855120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxim Bashorin","original_name":"Maxim Bashorin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a74a6cd7513ec0bc748f16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4855120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxim Bashorin","original_name":"Maxim Bashorin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a74a6122fa5128bd661a81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/e2oyUxnSewUiFuC3sfghEIBBJaS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One Sixth International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
