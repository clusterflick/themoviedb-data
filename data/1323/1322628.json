Ricardo, a Cuban gay refugee and his two American friends Sharon and Wes, express themselves through video taped documents which are juxtaposed with dramatized sequences based on their own experiences. The film imposes upon them circumstances which force them to deal with their contrasting backgrounds, their different prejudices and attitudes, their predetermined role in society, their relationship to one another and the reality of an uncertain future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three by Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calogero Salvo","original_name":"Calogero Salvo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a73d80169ca9722402b7d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092087","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
