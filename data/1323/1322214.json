We close the film enjoying the rare glimpse into the everyday backstage camaraderie of women who strip for a living. What lies between is a whodunit without the traditional victim or perpetrator. If there is a perpetrator, it is masculine entitlement fuelled by ridiculous ideas about female bodies. The only real victim of this film is the traditional easy trope of sensationalised violence against women and our persistent societal dishonesty about sex work.","popularity":0.3634,"poster_path":"/jNXjYut46QJ9GcGs1oVTm9usaSP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The RedRoom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4100084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Hoyland","original_name":"Holly Hoyland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Elektra","credit_id":"66a58fa54df5b07f2eb15683","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Ockenden","original_name":"Leon Ockenden","popularity":0.3708,"profile_path":"/vz3CdnZMbrvjASaCtOGoFUVS8Ck.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hugo","credit_id":"66a5926b138ba373721a1f3d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Cohen","original_name":"Sophie Cohen","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a592800bcab26cc43010fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Lindsay","original_name":"Michael Lindsay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a5939bbd6975ed9f3011b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32635098","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNXjYut46QJ9GcGs1oVTm9usaSP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
