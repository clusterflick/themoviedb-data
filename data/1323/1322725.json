And no matter where we come from, all human beings share this. We may not speak the same language or share the same culture, and we may have come from vastly different experiences in life but when we hear someone singing we immediately connect. We understand each other's suffering and joy. This is the purpose of our project.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songs We Carry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsering Tashi Gyalthang","original_name":"Tsering Tashi Gyalthang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a7986f34eb6c0e228081d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2656380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charwei Tsai","original_name":"Charwei Tsai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a79865c0518215b04143dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
