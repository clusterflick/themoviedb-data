In the early 1990s, at the dawn of her forties, she decided to devote herself to her personal work. Today, she is exhibited worldwide.  With her Leica camera in hand, Dolorès Marat takes an intimate look at her surroudings. She shots on the spot, as the blue hour settles. In her photographs, a dream-like strangeness overlaps the triviality of everyday life. Director Armelle Sèvre, also a photographer, wanted to see the world through Dolorès’ eyes. Together, the two women will scour the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in search of a wave…  Carried along by a bewitching soundtrack, this film dives in the enigmatic, hazy and colorful universe of a singular artist.","popularity":0.1533,"poster_path":"/l52vKh5haMSxUhHlHdE63xAn5mj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films d'Ici Méditerranée","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":193816,"logo_path":"/wN6aLnT9j9yaY4epaGM3z9yRNmw.png","name":"Mujō","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Dolorès Marat: The Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolorès Marat","original_name":"Dolorès Marat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66a7dfc58d7fa72cb2b31aa8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4855971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armelle Sèvre","original_name":"Armelle Sèvre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66a7dfdbe90039b18ce089f9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4855971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armelle Sèvre","original_name":"Armelle Sèvre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a7def6b268a2bdb45c1a08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1072,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nk04aB7kzYuC0B07RbGVC6YK6pk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1906}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1123,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/l52vKh5haMSxUhHlHdE63xAn5mj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":748}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1003,"name":"photographer"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
