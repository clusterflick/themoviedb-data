In Former Pizza Huts.","overview":"A contemporary portrait of America, told through a collection of stories observed within the walls of former Pizza Hut buildings across the country. These nostalgic spaces hold memories of a bygone era, but through the power of transformation, they provide something new and special for the communities that continue to flow through them.  From an LGBTQ+ church in Florida, to a karaoke bar in Texas, to a cannabis dispensary in rural Colorado, these modern-day portraits are paralleled with the origin story of Pizza Hut – one of America’s most iconic brands, and the two brothers who founded the company in Wichita, Kansas in 1958.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":"/9Ehk82QRSRFFxS7vF6Z0TXKHXQi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15038,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urtext Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slice of Life: The American Dream.
