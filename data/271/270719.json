She gets a burglar scare and insists on his staying home. However, he wants to go to a masked ball, so he gives her a powder, telling her it will make her sleep soundly. She slips the powder into his favorite decanter, hides his costume, and then retires. In the kitchen, the cook gives a policeman some of the doped whiskey. Neal takes the cop's coat, hat, and stick and starts for the ball. On the way he is called on to restrain a wife-beating husband. He gets a black eye, so decides to go home.","popularity":0.1103,"poster_path":"/tmBhF1o0oAJu2KVWTmnD7NDpTYm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christie Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hubby's Night Out","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Compson","original_name":"Betty Compson","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/wBvlOvaNmxbTYWgiE8iCqop7Psj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wifey","credit_id":"537acda6c3a3685e41000ead","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neal Burns","original_name":"Neal Burns","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/cs4oHDGo8TT3rHsMWMscJaMCUWF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hubby","credit_id":"537acdacc3a3685e14000d5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Barry","original_name":"Eddie Barry","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/eGqhScI6TY8K7RyYCpIXqL0ZTqi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"537acdb3c3a3685e32000dd8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Ham","original_name":"Harry Ham","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":"/xQRRfqn8GfdfDjfjYTcRevF5JBw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"537acdc0c3a3685e22000d63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella Adams","original_name":"Stella Adams","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/xXyMeZYfV8jti6TCdT5aiaRvG0O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cook","credit_id":"537acdc8c3a3685e39000d97","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Janecke","original_name":"Joe Janecke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Burglar","credit_id":"537acdcec3a3685e41000eb5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"537acd89c3a3685e1a000ce3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"61fea8c8fe5c9100df32c91b","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0479456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tmBhF1o0oAJu2KVWTmnD7NDpTYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
