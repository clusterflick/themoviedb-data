He walks inside an abandoned house to sleep for the night, as thunder rumbles and the skies promise a storm. Inside, everything is silent, and he throws himself on an old chair, falling asleep instantly.  It is when he wakes up that madness falls on him. The house is not all it seems, and Vincent is forced to relive his past, a past he has tried desperately to suppress and deny with drugs and denial for most of his life.","popularity":0.0518,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memoria","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elísabet Ýr Atladóttir","original_name":"Elísabet Ýr Atladóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537af2990e0a267ff7001000","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2759334","wikidata_id":"Q20729173","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
