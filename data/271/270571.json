Forced to band together because of a housing shortage, the film's heroines set up camp in a deserted structure, despite the tongue-cluckings of local busybodies and do-gooders. Complications ensue when a huge corporation announces plans to raze the building and erect a factory. Amazingly, the ladies are saved by the very company that wants to evict them.","popularity":0.3544,"poster_path":"/40pF1WI5zd7p2mu3jSNPKVlVsTR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films
