When he leans back and closes his eyes, the barbers decide to play a prank on him. Instead of a male barber they let a female hairdresser take care of the shaving. When the priest feels her soft fingers on his skin, he opens his eyes and sees the woman. He cannot do anything but stay in the chair, as he has shaving cream all around his chin. The woman continues the shaving in a rather sensual way. When the priest leaves the barber's shop, he looks disconcerted.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hetedik napon","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"On the Seventh Day","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"György Kézdy","original_name":"György Kézdy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xCBlpD994FPM4lkXnrTHQCw34SY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac4544d92514126b004270d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"György Linka","original_name":"György Linka","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac454550e0a260c14045a9c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1803197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva Tímár","original_name":"Éva Tímár","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/sYLlVMtO07R0AZ4jHI942BiPdbr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac4545cc3a3682d35045c26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iván Verebély","original_name":"Iván Verebély","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/t0AG27eAFmXsDcufZjKmEeQvBbr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac454640e0a260c2a04add2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István Szabó","original_name":"István Szabó","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/xoKtSZvgW3rp6YfFzxQk8bhc7nI.jpg","credit_id":"537ce3e60e0a262a84001dae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"László Lugossy","original_name":"László Lugossy","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fee9d3e4e4dff004196988c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0361701","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
