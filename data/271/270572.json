Hoffmann (1776-1822). While Hoffmann's literary work was longtime considered to be merely fantastical, it was finally researched, in the last years, according to its metaphysical background. Characteristic for Hoffmann's work is his life-long fight against rationalism and for the revelation of nature morte, culminating mostly in carnival-like scenes anticipating literary techniques only described in the works of Bachtin and Bachelard.","popularity":0.3828,"poster_path":"/2qfeFBHwDHIj5qdNimGdSd7PCC4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lothar Stark-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1916-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales of Hoffmann","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tales of Hoffmann","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Wolowsky","original_name":"Kurt Wolowsky","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"junger Hoffmann","credit_id":"537a3fd7c3a3685e0d000186","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Ruhbeck","original_name":"Max Ruhbeck","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/bgWfA5jKDutu2zybAqwKSRvApF0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Onkel","credit_id":"537a3fe1c3a3685e1a000199","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Ronay","original_name":"Paula Ronay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tante","credit_id":"537a3fecc3a3685e290001a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Krauss","original_name":"Werner Krauß","popularity":0.3056,"profile_path":"/xlyS30qzcndmczxG5JdJWwJ1heI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Conte Dapertutto","credit_id":"537a3ff6c3a3685e410001cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich Kühne","original_name":"Friedrich Kühne","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/s3IZm9oeDPxk6bw9j6v0RY92YO5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Coppelius, Brillenhändler","credit_id":"537a4000c3a3685e390001c4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lupu Pick","original_name":"Lupu Pick","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/74evq3BmxFPOhT5Dsn4k0EVmsRT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Spalanzani, Direktor eines Museums","credit_id":"537a400ac3a3685e290001a9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Ludwig","original_name":"Ernst Ludwig","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rat Crespel","credit_id":"537a4014c3a3685e1a0001a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelly Ridon","original_name":"Nelly Ridon","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Frau Rat Crespel","credit_id":"537a401fc3a3685e290001ac","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Oswald","original_name":"Ruth Oswald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"kleine Antonia","credit_id":"537a4029c3a3685e410001d3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Van Horn","original_name":"Andreas Van Horn","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Dr. Mirakel","credit_id":"537a4033c3a3685e32000190","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Kaiser-Titz","original_name":"Erich Kaiser-Titz","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/p1xCNHyzTCJO30Ia6ZPFG1U7Zt.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"E.T.A.
