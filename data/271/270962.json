But it isn't long before all four of them are swimming for their lives, and The Three Fishketeers finally learn what heroism really is.","popularity":0.1224,"poster_path":"/lzHMtCYuwrDGr4NuggAkPQMVf8E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perennial Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Fishketeers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763105,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Adam Dykstra","original_name":"Adam Dykstra","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Toby (voice)","credit_id":"5c168cf5c3a36866d837db5c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russ Harris","original_name":"Russ Harris","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gillas (voice)","credit_id":"5c168d1592514132c60bc1ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"G.
