By systematically scrutinising the industry that capitalises on the love for man's best friend, Moullet has made an absurdist film that shows how the love of animals has become a kind of surrogate religion for many people. He takes us to canine beauticians and beauty contests, and explores the field from dried dog food to advanced super-duper pooper-scoopers. By showing in great detail all those gadgets and gimmicks to make the lives of pets as agreeable as possible, Moullet vents his barely concealed criticism of consumer society.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":"/jUkrtsUHcwNRGOD5tjgTYfOOxgd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Empire de Médor","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Moullet","original_name":"Luc Moullet","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/zzZ3ACtgddW0r14ftmydsFq9VE7.jpg","credit_id":"537bcd810e0a262a8e00002c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0258548","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jUkrtsUHcwNRGOD5tjgTYfOOxgd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5W1LAf5TG86MN4BisDp3aZFazGL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
