Tham, caretaker of Victory Hotel, a relatively small establishment in downtown Saigon, nervously observes these celebrations. The owners have fled Saigon and the hotel is to be requisitioned by the new government. Tham wonders what his fate will be under the new regime. The next day he is told that that the hotel is to be transformed into a collective flat for the Viet Cong cadre and their families now entering the city. Tham is not hostile to this but is concerned about his place in the new set up. Will he still have a job? Will he be treated as an enemy?","popularity":0.1131,"poster_path":"/jSfzfHDmD0UOsaOovEDEyjYYDkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fonds Sud Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":78240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giai Phong Film Studio","origin_country":"VN"},{"id":129052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agence Intergouvernementale de la Francophonie (AIF-CIREF)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"1999-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Building","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Building","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das Wohnhaus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duong Don","original_name":"Duong Don","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/8J7ekjASe85or26TyFRyUS5Bwad.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53786d0ac3a368554200331b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1320857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anh Hong","original_name":"Anh Hong","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53786d37c3a3685542003327","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thanh Mai","original_name":"Thanh Mai","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56f953e592514168d5000fa1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minh Trang","original_name":"Minh Trang","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":"/mZi02gbPK8hrGzCu7GpmbVPKLKR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"56f953f29251410a31003c4d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1293685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Việt Linh","original_name":"Việt Linh","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/3Bt8k9B3r8xz7wnm9Jr9qReYdMa.jpg","credit_id":"53786cdcc3a368554a003542","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0217320","wikidata_id":"Q14442565","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jSfzfHDmD0UOsaOovEDEyjYYDkA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chung cư (Hãng phim GIải Phóng, 1999)","key":"T-xuPnnvBF4","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-10T13:41:50.000Z","id":"67fbd2723110bd82dfacfd94"}]}}}
