Al-Talib consults his Evil Spirit, who advises him to find the magic lamp hidden in an underground cave. Unable to get it himself, al-Talib hires Aladdin, who secures the lamp but keeps it when he realizes al-Talib's wickedness. With wealth obtained through wishes, Aladdin courts the princess. After the lamp changes hands between al-Talib and Aladdin, al-Talib steals it and abducts the princess to the desert. Aladdin follows with only a gourd of water. Suffering from thirst and exhaustion, Aladdin nearly succumbs, but the horsemen of the Sultan, who learned of his daughter's abduction, ride up and rescue Aladdin.","popularity":0.3038,"poster_path":"/azFi4hi7JlMKntMRbPs0OwHElrJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Carpenter","original_name":"Francis Carpenter","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aladdin","credit_id":"537a4260c3a3685e1a0001d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.A.
