It is an examination of real people that will change how we think about nurses and how we wrestle with the challenges of healing America. THE AMERICAN NURSE is an important contribution to America's ongoing conversation about what it means to care. The film follows the paths of five nurses in various practice specialties including Jason Short as he drives up a rugged creek to reach a home-bound cancer patient in Appalachia. Tonia Faust, who runs a prison hospice program where inmates serving life sentences care for their fellow inmates as they're dying. Naomi Cross, as she coaches an ovarian cancer survivor through the Caesarean delivery of her son. Sister Stephen, a nun who runs a nursing home filled with goats, sheep, llamas and chickens, where the entire nursing staff comes together to sing for a dying resident.","popularity":0.3919,"poster_path":"/wn1sORi7sHORc1mBnua92qDPalv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carolyn Jones Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American Nurse","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafayette Ballard","original_name":"Lafayette Ballard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c38ee10f46004f9616b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Bloesl","original_name":"Stephen Bloesl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self (as Sister Stephen Bloesl)","credit_id":"62d9c3971c6aa7004c9e929b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3633055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Cross","original_name":"Jason Cross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c3a81c6aa7005ea4d97a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Namoi Cross","original_name":"Namoi Cross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c3b11c6aa7004c9e92ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Cross","original_name":"Nathan Cross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c3bddb7058012d8e1a54","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Elam","original_name":"Elizabeth Elam","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c3c5b39e35004fc5827d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonia Faust","original_name":"Tonia Faust","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c4439d8939004ef562d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Fletcher","original_name":"Lydia Fletcher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c44ac50ad20069dd3bcd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darrell Gertenschologer","original_name":"Darrell Gertenschologer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c453a3144000543a55a6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1321652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolyn Jones","original_name":"Carolyn Jones","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/4gtbV5UbfyZ5wZuibhhzLDWPP4W.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"62d9c45ebd320900507c910d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dane Kaimuloa","original_name":"Dane Kaimuloa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c465aafebd00542efbf3","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian McMillion","original_name":"Brian McMillion","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c46c8261ee0054e4ea91","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Prater","original_name":"Mary Prater","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c473bbe1dd00529bc95a","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Regalado","original_name":"Mia Regalado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Self -
