Entrusted to smugglers, they are risking their lives by illegally crossing the great Himalayan range, a towering rampart between Tibet and India. The director will take us in the Mussorie school, in North India, where two thousand four hundred children have been rescued. They have left behind their family childhood and are now considered as orphans. We will discover the itineraries of Sonam, aged nine, and Dholma, the little new girl of the school. Here in India, they are taught about Tibetan culture and will find out about the history of their country and their ancestors. Sonam and Dholma's story is that of thousands of Tibetan children. Are they orphans of a lost country or bearers of hope who will save an endangered culture?","popularity":0.1903,"poster_path":"/h7Wan5NMlDZFQ4DTVaR3MSshUyI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orphans of Tibet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dholma","original_name":"Dholma","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0bfc04c3a36875970096aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":984922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonam","original_name":"Sonam","popularity":0.4616,"profile_path":"/e5qikxNuV8AcoY5j0cxJYi1n4Eq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0bfc0cc3a3687610009937","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Capel","original_name":"Julie Capel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0bfc24c3a36875e800a9b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421267,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Garnault","original_name":"Françoise Garnault","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0bfc38c3a3687610009970","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1649050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7Wan5NMlDZFQ4DTVaR3MSshUyI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4558,"name":"tibet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
