Chock-full of innuendo, dodgy lifts, occasional customers and much loved regulars, this documentary tells the story of the long running farce set in the clothing section of a dilapidated department store.  It's an affectionate look back at one of Britain's most popular sitcoms, where off camera the veneer of camaraderie concealed an undercurrent of envy and sadness.","popularity":0.206,"poster_path":"/teybGHeXL5unsmtuoP731ygXPEw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are you being served?","title":"The Story of 'Are You Being Served?'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Story Of Are You Being Served?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Armstrong","original_name":"Alexander Armstrong","popularity":0.3709,"profile_path":"/e0kvGIfrjah4UmbUdKKobTgcxEd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"559cc1acc3a3681be4000d83","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samantha Peters","original_name":"Samantha Peters","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559cc1989251414214000cb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1577882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yqEHoXWWjeYwfaIi99eLAcMCXM6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":1689,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/teybGHeXL5unsmtuoP731ygXPEw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1172}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
