Dreamt up by the younger son of a Sicilian dynasty, Vincenzo Florio, the Targa Florio ran until 1977 and was simultaneously considered as both totally insane and an absolute ‘must do’ by drivers and manufacturers alike.  A Sicilian Dream is a theatrical documentary that journeys into the very heart of this story, exploring its many intrigues and revelations. Our journey is led by one of Italy’s most preeminent dreamers: Francesco da Mosto, star of several BBC series, the well-known Venetian architect, historian and incurable romantic and Alain de Cadenet, a Renaissance Man and a racing driver who nearly died in the race.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/jFMvXlHUDPcHxILE01myPYjbpkD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pistons, Passions, Pleasures","title":"A Sicilian Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5571350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jFMvXlHUDPcHxILE01myPYjbpkD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
