One of the best German infantry divisions, the 18th VG fell on the over extended 106th dug in on the Schnee Eifel, where two US regiments were surrounded and forced to surrender.Major General Jones was unable to stem what became a general retreat but, as in all retreats, both the best and the worst of human nature was on display. Small groups of officers and men fought on repeatedly, delaying the German spearheads on the road to St Vith and buying time for elements of 7th US Armd Div to arrive. After a desperate fight, Field Marshal Montgomery controversially took over the Northern shoulder of the Bulge and ordered 7th Armd Div and the remnants of the 106th to abandon St Vith.","popularity":0.4995,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of the Bulge: Saint Vith","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"SAINT VITH - BATTLE OF THE BULGE","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56cd845bc3a368276e001c31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hone","original_name":"Richard Hone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56cd846dc3a3682762001f52","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56cd84a09251415cdf001f8a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56cd84adc3a368276b001e02","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":4595,"name":"us army"},{"id":173383,"name":"ardennes"},{"id":185005,"name":"battle of the bulge"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
