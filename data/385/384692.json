This is a fully dramatised film, which captures the essence of Paddington, not only by striking visuals of the Old-Sydney architecture in the area, but by re-enacting the mood and lifestyle of some typical, bohemian inhabitants. Scripted by Joan Long. Music by Grahame Bond and Rory O'Donaghue. Starring Ross Thompson, Janne Wesley and Ron Blanchard.","popularity":0.2302,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paddington Lace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Thompson","original_name":"Ross Thompson","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56d05b40c3a3681e4a005b2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Blanchard","original_name":"Ron Blanchard","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56d05b58c3a3681e36005ca1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris McCullough","original_name":"Chris McCullough","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d05b2cc3a3681e3c0069c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
