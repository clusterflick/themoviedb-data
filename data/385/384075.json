Nadine's mother, Delilah; a fanatical Christian who believes demons have possessed her daughter, searches for a \"cure\" for Nadine's erratic behavior. When she finds a rogue preacher willing to exorcise her daughter for a fee, neither realizes they have invited the devil into their home. While her mother turns a blind eye to the bizarre practices unfolding in her own home, Nadine, racked with mental and physical pain, has no choice but to put up with the preacher's increasingly violent charade.","popularity":0.2643,"poster_path":"/qBqbtA3yB2qfT9tk86Gv6sBvYhO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exploited, Abused, Addicted and Sick: Nadine Survived the Streets, but Can She Survive an Exorcism?","title":"Upsidedown Cross","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Possession of Nadine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Russ","original_name":"Erin Russ","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/8fAzyW6V1DMzRXTDxPg79PlSGT4.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nadine","credit_id":"56ca9a9cc3a368409700b28d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":399681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Yow","original_name":"David Yow","popularity":0.1946,"profile_path":"/rbL8wH5G8gBd93RjOcfcFLC3e2l.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Preacher","credit_id":"56ca9ab3c3a368409700b291","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Cohan","original_name":"Colleen Cohan","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Delilah","credit_id":"56ca9aea92514130a90032e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Savage","original_name":"Rick Savage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Detective #1","credit_id":"56cf5cb49251413e68003573","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Krause","original_name":"Tina Krause","popularity":0.3058,"profile_path":"/bLFW9vtswqrw6Bnb4lFm3ff3prS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Colleen","credit_id":"56cf5d4b925141799e000a98","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark DeMicco","original_name":"Mark DeMicco","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"56cf5d6d9251416e3a000bd1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Bonacore","original_name":"Victor Bonacore","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Client #1","credit_id":"56cf5da2925141799e000ab0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Moran","original_name":"Charles Moran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Client #2","credit_id":"56cf5dd89251413e6a0037b5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.J.
