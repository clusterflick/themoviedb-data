Minus 10 juxtaposes footage of the artist’s father in Los Alamos and on the way to Tinian Island with an interview with a woman in Japanese about the bombing. Minus 9 aligns an American nurse’s eyewitness account of the bombing and its aftermath with aerial landscape shots blocked by a blinking blue circle which could represent a mutant sun, an eye, planet Earth, an afterimage, or the inverted “rising sun” of Japanese national symbolism. Minus 8 and Minus 7 show excerpts from a documentary, The Growth of Plants overlaid by running text describing radiation-induced botanical mutations. Minus 6 explores current American war policies and ethics contrasted against the histrionics of Adolf Hitler; as the dictator gesticulates on-screen, women’s voices recite a diatribe by Goebbels.","popularity":0.0645,"poster_path":"/uWEI0L2Bsl7g5LxShgPKnpOQ6Wr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let Me Count the Ways: 10...9…8…7…6","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Thornton","original_name":"Leslie Thornton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ca9cf1c3a368409100a576","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uWEI0L2Bsl7g5LxShgPKnpOQ6Wr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
