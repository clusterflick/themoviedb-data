She rises above formidable obstacles to assume a leading role in her field. Julia Robinson was the first woman elected to the mathematical section of the National Academy of Sciences, and the first woman to become president of the American Mathematical Society. While tracing Robinson's contribution to the solution of Hilbert's tenth problem, the film illuminates how her work led to an unusual friendship between Russian and American colleagues at the height of the Cold War.","popularity":0.3013,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73561,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZALA Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julia Robinson and Hilbert's Tenth Problem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Paul Csicsery","original_name":"George Paul Csicsery","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56cce570c3a36827770002f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1702786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Skip Sweeney","original_name":"Skip Sweeney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec896d70fb17f001b7c62c4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935196,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tal Skloot","original_name":"Tal Skloot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec896c76c8492001f2ab435","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414839,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Sharaf","original_name":"John Sharaf","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec896de140bad001b1a0dcb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dan Reid","original_name":"Dan Reid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec896e66c849200212c8df2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649982,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeroen Vermelyen","original_name":"Jeroen Vermelyen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec896cfe635710022d0ee56","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Paul Csicsery","original_name":"George Paul Csicsery","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec896b98e2e000021276a1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649986,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Giannini","original_name":"John Giannini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec8970e6c849200212c8e1d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3278,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Adler","original_name":"Mark Adler","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/g31rIHaTBeK0xHHMezl7NwmzYtP.jpg","credit_id":"5ec896c06c849200212c8d92","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649985,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Kent","original_name":"Peter Kent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec896fd0fb17f001d7dbd5a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649987,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrew A.
