Seems several years ago he took five hookers to a remote hotel suite known as the Pony Room and spent the entire evening satisfying their every need. Now, nearing death and continuously soused to the gills, he wants Ed and Burt to take him back there for a weekend of reminiscing. The road trip will be difficult, especially with Grandpa’s lack of control (bowel or otherwise), but what waits there is even more disconcerting – a cursed can of chicken noodle soup.” (review excerpt by Bill Gibron)","popularity":0.4196,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandpa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Dougal","original_name":"Miles Dougal","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Burt","credit_id":"6102f9e9ee43e80027bdd52c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Murcia","original_name":"Joey Murcia","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ed","credit_id":"6102f9f7d207f3005e7857fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Tyree","original_name":"Bill Tyree","popularity":0.0411,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Grandpa","credit_id":"6102fa05db72c03bfb286e9a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Naylor","original_name":"Tiffany Naylor","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Stripper","credit_id":"6102fa13ee43e8005e339b04","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3177842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hewey","original_name":"Hewey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hardware Store Guy","credit_id":"6102fa258d1b8e0047c3ea67","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"6102fa37cee481005e3a1d65","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"6102fa446517d6005e3860f1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"6102fa52ee43e8005e339b81","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Dougal","original_name":"Miles Dougal","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6102fa5af706de08de008a1a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"6102fa6a8d1b8e0047c3eb4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"5a56355f0e0a2607d1026421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Rifkin","original_name":"Adam Rifkin","popularity":0.4821,"profile_path":"/hDXT7Hx3MU3XT2W6MvBqlxAPm3E.jpg","credit_id":"5abded149251416018007b3f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0756653","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
