First, its credits include Jules Verne: his second after the Méliès TRIP TO THE MOON a couple of years earlier. Second, it uses a dozen cuts, irised lenses -- the balloonists' views through their telescope -- panning shots, combined images and tints. The tints were standard for the era, but everything else had to be achieved with great difficulty. In an era when most movies still lasted a minute with a stationary camera and a single set-up, this was pretty much state of the art.","popularity":0.3526,"poster_path":"/upd5kkmhUCBRJER8PrYREHsU1CA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1904-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drama in the Air","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaston Velle","original_name":"Gaston Velle","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/dmhvP4i2uUSUw0CAa16aANJQF2m.jpg","credit_id":"56d29bc1c3a3681e3600d8cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaston Velle","original_name":"Gaston Velle","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/dmhvP4i2uUSUw0CAa16aANJQF2m.jpg","credit_id":"56d29bd3925141799e00b38c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2088,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Verne","original_name":"Jules Verne","popularity":0.4502,"profile_path":"/vdbQLwcvF3UNTJw9Z2OgQzGzoGx.jpg","credit_id":"56d29bf6c3a3681e3c00f347","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0448832","wikidata_id":"Q104875577","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/upd5kkmhUCBRJER8PrYREHsU1CA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9903,"name":"balloon"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1904-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1904-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Drama in the Air (1904)","key":"E6dkhmkcI98","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-11T09:52:20.000Z","id":"658c46bc5cd16e6d0cd28c41"}]}}}
