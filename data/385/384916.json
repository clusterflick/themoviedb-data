The film follows Rhonda Zwillinger as she reenacts glamour poses in her camp/trash bedroom, and as she walks down Hollywood Boulevard.  This is intercut with found footage (depicting various stars, such as Elvis, Bardot, Marilyn etc), which, like that in Play Boy, is re-photographed and fucked up so that the celluloid itself is as much of the film's theme as the images it depicts.  The film thus positions the ironic glamorous stances of Rhonda as part of a series of repetitious gestures which serve to signify glamour and stardom (for example Rhonda's star on the Boulevard), while film stardom itself is shown to be a transient myth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3LNu5vsxFe9BctCUSQwovVhupls.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rhonda Goes to Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tessa Hughes-Freeland","original_name":"Tessa Hughes-Freeland","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/k2Do9tPPZ76A8fFnW9bOpPJrm8c.jpg","credit_id":"56d230009251413e5f00b917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1324,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8CTRNFKtdKowecnyIhd1GGw6WPW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2353}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3LNu5vsxFe9BctCUSQwovVhupls.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1472,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mQ8eZRIzE6vrkPQjlOZzaez8ssg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
