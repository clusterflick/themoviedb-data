This is a re-release from the earlier VHS video and as such is just a copy of that. The first three songs are \"Peace Sells\", \"Wake Up Dead\" and \"In My Darkest Hour\". All have Dave Mustaine and David Ellefson giving insights into the recording of the videos. The fourth track is a cover of the Sex pistols \"Anarchy In The UK\". Finally ending with two of Megadeth's most classic songs of all, \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\" and \"Hangar 18\". This DVD version was only released in the UK.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/j5VlE5xUTy4mBvNITp3EMtnlbSi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Megadeth: Rusted Pieces","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":854,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j5VlE5xUTy4mBvNITp3EMtnlbSi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
