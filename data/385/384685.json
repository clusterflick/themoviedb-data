Unique and harsh are their destinies during the  World War I and the revolution, at the opposite fronts of civil war, in 1930s. The victories of the Riflemen, their courage, confidence, pain and tragedy. The authors of the film have been able to save these tales from the relentless flow of time and make everyone realise the role of the Latvian Riflemen in history and nation.","popularity":0.0928,"poster_path":"/bLetx9oXYHL5N8ocVQ2UQkTHz0O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82801,"logo_path":"/8h6Ugz5S1DiX7kaeg19eQKXsS4q.png","name":"Rīgas kinostudija","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1982-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Constellation of Riflemen","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juris Podnieks","original_name":"Juris Podnieks","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/rYOGRT9BUowScn75waud3vTGeTC.jpg","credit_id":"56d04b879251413e5f005a24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arnolds Plaudis","original_name":"Arnolds Plaudis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f15a93d5ff34e0038601eac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juris Podnieks","original_name":"Juris Podnieks","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/rYOGRT9BUowScn75waud3vTGeTC.jpg","credit_id":"5f15a9324083b300350f8021","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397060,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aivars Riekstiņš","original_name":"Aivars Riekstiņš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f15a95c3852020036d72872","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105428,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raimonds Pauls","original_name":"Raimonds Pauls","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":"/2ZSpbF6Yqz0crt8KXrHoYwWYt14.jpg","credit_id":"5f15a9851c6aa700348de23d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272060,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maija Selecka","original_name":"Maija Selecka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f15a96978570e0034625e74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582976,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andris Slapiņš","original_name":"Andris Slapiņš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe91405bf7744003d2460e1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8836652","wikidata_id":"Q4426790","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1754,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/bLetx9oXYHL5N8ocVQ2UQkTHz0O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"Riga, Latvian SSR, USSR","release_date":"1982-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
