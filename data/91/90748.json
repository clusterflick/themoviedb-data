The United Nations estimates as many as 200 million girls are missing in the world today because of this so-called “gendercide”.  The film tells the stories of abandoned and trafficked girls, of women who suffer extreme dowry-related violence, of brave mothers fighting to save their daughters’ lives, and of other mothers who would kill for a son. Global experts and grassroots activists put the stories in context and advocate different paths towards change, while collectively lamenting the lack of any truly effective action against this injustice.","popularity":0.0853,"poster_path":"/x4rbN8H9VJwtABIgK25X399tLHO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The three deadliest words in the world","title":"It’s a Girl!","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Grae Davis","original_name":"Evan Grae Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e7fef992514127ec05addf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2221404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x4rbN8H9VJwtABIgK25X399tLHO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
