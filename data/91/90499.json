Hippie-type rebel Rochus 'Rocco' Siwak incurs a community service to be spent there as orderly. Sympathizing with seniors who still aspire to some dignity and self-realization, he helps them get around the rules, such as smuggling in contraband, and ends up inspiring them to form a rock band and enter a free podium competition. But it doesn't square with his own last shot as band guitarist.—KGF
