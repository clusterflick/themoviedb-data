Under 30 minutes in length, this 1973 film shows Leary at his most engaging and personable. It’s a testament to his considerable charm that he was able to pull off such a performance, considering that the prison warden and other officials were sitting across the room listening as this was filmed.  Leary discusses his jailbreak (intimating that the daughter of a United States senator he refuses to name helped him), the revolution in consciousness and drugs, Eldridge Cleaver and what it feels like to be an imprisoned philosopher.","popularity":0.6164,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Folsom Prison with Dr. Timothy Leary","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"At Folsom Prison with Timothy Leary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Leary","original_name":"Timothy Leary","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/kFTPQ1ood6HKh1hRRr4wLe76JHN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48ac9251416c750af9ef","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Bullock","original_name":"Tom Bullock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48ac9251416c750af9fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Leary","original_name":"Joanna Leary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48ac9251416c750af9f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6086,"name":"government"},{"id":2883,"name":"imprisonment"},{"id":9777,"name":"prison escape"},{"id":11210,"name":"psychadelic image"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"},{"id":15106,"name":"psychiatrist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
