In the creation story of Ho-Chunk, the artist’s home nation, the spirits are placed at the Earth’s cardinal points, ensuring that its rotation is not chaotic. Ho-Chunk, now known as Wisconsin, translates as “People of the Great Voice” and stretches from Red Banks to Trempealeau, and from Minneapolis to Milwaukee. The film is divided into 5 parts — Wijirawaséwe (Island Weights), yoiréreginarere (the west), rek’úhuhíra (the south), hą́boguominàgara (the east), siniwagúreginągere (the north) — and follows an individual as he recounts his journey along the boundaries of Ho-Chunk lands. Visually, the viewer is drawn from the tumultuous waves of the Mississippi to serene forests, tranquil lakes, enormous shopping malls, earthen effigies and Ho-Chunk relics. The narrator is not only looking for the spirits, but also wishes to honor them.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island Weights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sky Hopinka","original_name":"Sky Hopinka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hYPYrwtFcrvgWXKT4AJBBW0eAi0.jpg","credit_id":"655f921b1dbc880100e271c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
