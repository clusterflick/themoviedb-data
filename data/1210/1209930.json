Where the water resources of the country do not belong to the state but to private individuals and one company can own an entire river and possess an amount of water equal to the area of Belgium. Where water has been transformed from a life public good into property, and a \"water right\" can cost as much as a house. Even in the Atacama desert, considered the driest region on the planet, mining companies (major owners of Chile's longest river, Rio Loa) pump huge quantities and use the precious water to wash minerals, condemning thousands of indigenous people and farming villages to thirst and poverty.","popularity":0.0702,"poster_path":"/rUTIxGfi2Y5d73Qc3pOFfVJdYgr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2010-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life is for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yorgos Avgeropoulos","original_name":"Γιώργος Αυγερόπουλος","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/i9NCy9ntQgefKLVMsLQc6PpbzKu.jpg","credit_id":"6562834e028f14013822bb5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yorgos Avgeropoulos","original_name":"Γιώργος Αυγερόπουλος","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/i9NCy9ntQgefKLVMsLQc6PpbzKu.jpg","credit_id":"6562837ba6c10400aca7c558","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324323,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yiannis Avgeropoulos","original_name":"Yiannis Avgeropoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65628394a6c104011bddbbef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324323,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yiannis Avgeropoulos","original_name":"Yiannis Avgeropoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656283a33679a109764753b1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yiannis Paxevanis","original_name":"Yiannis Paxevanis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656283cd3679a10977e0cfe6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Biliris","original_name":"Yiannis Biliris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65628405ed96bc011e226321","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324328,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Prokou","original_name":"Anna Prokou","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6562841824418200ebe4960a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324320,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anastasia Skoubri","original_name":"Anastasia Skoubri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65628435ed96bc00ae469f4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yiannis Paxevanis","original_name":"Yiannis Paxevanis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65628470b234b900e2c74163","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUTIxGfi2Y5d73Qc3pOFfVJdYgr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
