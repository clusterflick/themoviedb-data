It was begun in 1977 and completed from 1988 to 1991, to a libretto by the composer.  The main theme of Dienstag is the struggle between the protagonist Michael and his antagonist Lucifer (with the feminine character Eve appearing in a more tangential role, trying to broker a peace between them or mourning the carnage). The first Act portrays this competition in the form of a \"time game\", in which the two combatants employ humorous tactics and feints in orders to stop/start time's march. This initial \"fight by proxy\" leads to the more direct 2nd (and final) Act, which portrays all-out war using mobile sound-warriors in an apocalyptic 3D sound environment.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/b0PiHU6sP0b4Svz0TMXn5C4QNIl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dienstag aus Licht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","original_name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/pUCmDaVAzjSfkapFAFT7AwEMSqr.jpg","credit_id":"655fd95a2b113d00ada2e428","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","original_name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/pUCmDaVAzjSfkapFAFT7AwEMSqr.jpg","credit_id":"655fd968efe37c013b2c3607","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.76,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b0PiHU6sP0b4Svz0TMXn5C4QNIl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
