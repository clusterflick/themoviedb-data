The ensuing tour spawned the live album, Hell Freezes Over, which debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart. It included four new studio songs, with 'Get Over It' and 'Love Will Keep Us Alive' both becoming Top 40 hits. The album - for which the live tracks were recorded at an MTV Special on April 24, 1994 - proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The following night - April 25, 1994 - the Eagles returned to Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, CA, where they had recorded the previous night, and a second show was filmed and indeed transmitted on television. For the first time on vinyl, this release features this relaxed and quite extraordinary event in its entirety. Captured across two installments, this delightful and rare performance will prove a must have item for Eagles fans everywhere.","popularity":0.9405,"poster_path":"/pqi3fkOPuWFV5Ln0pw3GPrXo5IT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eagles Unplugged 1994 (The Second Night)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Frey","original_name":"Glenn Frey","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":"/f4Mi3Uws3ZLlb0cIGwkPX51R4ti.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6561e7f43679a109764723ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Felder","original_name":"Don Felder","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/25m72byHinpuNhmGfrZqxxy1Hid.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6561e80e028f1400feab316a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1783184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Meisner","original_name":"Randy Meisner","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/qW6vY0Yo1FmfUwqJP41FFwn6Tma.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6561e82ca6c10400feb0a5be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Henley","original_name":"Don Henley","popularity":0.5938,"profile_path":"/mFVfzuSL1bEhnRwcdNG2vYY3q0D.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6561e85fa6c10400aca7912b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Walsh","original_name":"Joe Walsh","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/2cihrXQeODd0JiYd78IVu9whHW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6561e878244182010cb4bc81","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy B.
