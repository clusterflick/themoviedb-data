Three Japanese Midget Submarines entered Sydney Harbour and launched an attack on American, British and Australian naval vessels at anchor. 21 men would be killed, 4 will take their own lives and 2 would vanish. The most concise reconstruction of the Japanese attack in Sydney Harbour is superbly presented in this feature length documentary film production. The balanced presentation of the events leading up to and after this incredible event in Australian and Japanese history are superbly relived by the men and women involved in the attack. Both Australian and Japanese servicemen and relatives recount a different time in the world, as it was then.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He's Coming South","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":173397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damien Lay","original_name":"Damien Lay","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656295007dfda65931748e3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4673851,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Williams","original_name":"Steve Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662a186ebf31f20099e3369a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1786504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
