Their first non-makeup album, Lick It Up, followed soon after and successfully re-established the band among the heavy metal masses worldwide. Kiss also reconnected with their stateside fans -- Lick It Up was the band's first record to achieve gold status since 1980's Kiss Unmasked. The album's success was spurred by MTV's repeated airing of the imaginative video for the album's strong title track, and songs such as \"Exciter,\" \"Not for the Innocent,\" \"A Million to One,\" and the rap-rocker \"All Hell's Breaking Loose\" confirmed that the band was back on the right track.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/wRwIISeHDRrFdhyrhZf7oVG09Mr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiss Lick It Up Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b2845lvUtjxVcZ8i92HU7gDaZe5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wRwIISeHDRrFdhyrhZf7oVG09Mr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
