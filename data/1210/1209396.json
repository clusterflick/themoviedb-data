We see a smartphone chat in which ‘the West’ asks for forgiveness. But what purpose does an apology serve? Who benefits from it? Which power structures are concealed behind it? Should the present apologise for the past? And can this past ever really be forgiven? Sorry for Real questions the unequal balance of power within the politics of compensation, and emphasises the need to decolonise technologies and reconciliation strategies.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorry for Real","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2585355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tabita Rezaire","original_name":"Tabita Rezaire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6560c9e27dfda600fe667531","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
