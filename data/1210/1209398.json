People no longer pay attention to the famous actors of the past. The troupe went on tour without them. They gladly agree to introduce their art to the residents of the village of Fandauri, but as they arrive in the village  they find out that they have been invited  to the opening of the spring, and they are only asking them for a poem or just a word that touches their heart. The cheerful mood of the actors will be replaced by a sad one.","popularity":0.2079,"poster_path":"/lRPqLumZ7zQwLeAuPKFkZBblg86.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
