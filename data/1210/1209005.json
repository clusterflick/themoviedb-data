A busy journalist called Herbert Prince sets out for a much-needed holiday, and while on the train he is mistaken for Prince Karl Heinrich of Snobbéria. Deciding to have a little fun, Prince stays in character as a royal. Upon arriving in his holiday destination of Waldeck, he is effusively received by the mayor, with whose daughter Prince immediately falls in love.
