Shot in Ben Archer's fly-on-the-wall 'gonzo' style of filmmaking and taken from the band's late-2019 tour of England's south coast, this documentary focuses on the joy of performance and music in an environment that does not often allow such expression. Bookended by short commentary from the band's lead singer Jonny Foster, 'Hardwicke Circus: The Prison Gig' is an uplifting ode to the power and necessity of art, even for those that society have deemed not to deserve it.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":"/sl3LwSiII33DbNj2ZBpE1fVNgnf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hi, criminals!","title":"Hardwicke Circus: The Prison Gig","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2924560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Archer","original_name":"Ben Archer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2lT28Gx9CCAQgrcup8vkfjnbkNs.jpg","credit_id":"65a03ce31c635b012b0ca52f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2926696,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sal Redpath","original_name":"Sal Redpath","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/9wyEnC2YDurguegmjXxhPmcfNFZ.jpg","credit_id":"65a03cee7d55040129990cea","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4476081,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Charlotte Archer","original_name":"Charlotte Archer","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a03cf91c635b01220ca585","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/evVtXyrGz2FUpZOtzP1u7CH7nDO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2520}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sl3LwSiII33DbNj2ZBpE1fVNgnf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":242921,"name":"rap"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“Hardwicke Circus: The Prison Gig”","key":"jrMkqFDB9CU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-24T19:29:30.000Z","id":"65a03cbc1c635b012e0ca593"}]}}}
