Thirty years later, Miguel, one of the members of the band, still dreams of being a rock star, even though no one goes to his concerts and his music store is about to be seized by the bank. Ordúñez, a famous rock radio communicator, offers him to give a concert at the Palace of Madrid on the condition that he reunites the original members of the band.","popularity":0.4821,"poster_path":"/j61AYdBcEk6WZZzxmhfoNZccn4j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Super 8
