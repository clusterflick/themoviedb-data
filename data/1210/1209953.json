Εκεί στο Νότο","overview":"An island in the libyan Sea. Land’s end; a place of exile; a refuge. For some, it is Homer’s legendary Ogygia, where Odysseus spent seven years. There, at Europe’s southern-most point, people from different countries and different backgrounds coexist. Locals, who have spent their “hidden” life there, away from the outside world and are now trying to juggle the benefits of progress and their old morals. And “self-exiled” romantics, who have found their Ithaca, a lost paradise. Two worlds that coexist, despite their differences, sharing the same concerns for the future of the island, facing the same problems of everyday life and setting the example of living together in solidarity over economic competition.","popularity":0.0728,"poster_path":"/bwKfxSRV3tWfMYLq8zSxNaj0ayw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tele Film","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2012-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gavdos.
