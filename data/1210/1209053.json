In the summer of 2021 GCN+ decided to find out by putting together seven strong local cyclists to train and race as a team under the leadership of EF Education-NIPPO sports director Tom Southam.  Can ‘Worldtour’ Tom whip these ‘Cat Four’ riders into a race-winning machine? And how can they work together, knowing there’s a selection process for the final road race that will leave two riders left out of the team?
