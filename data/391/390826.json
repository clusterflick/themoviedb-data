While the short portrait documentary field is certainly overcrowded, director Mohammad Gorjestani’s film is beautifully shot and quickly paced. It’s got a certain energy that can’t be denied (much like artwork driving the film). Plus, the central character is an inspiring symbol of artistic authenticity and self-liberation. A former advertising executive, MissMe ditched her high-profile corporate day job to become a counter-voice to the objectification of women in the mainstream advertising world. Girl power, indeed.","popularity":0.6518,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missme: The Artful Vandal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MissMe","original_name":"MissMe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56fdb47dc3a36821a000015e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammad Gorjestani","original_name":"Mohammad Gorjestani","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/oM7uPlTOOhKWl3tv4HYUwIIWLRT.jpg","credit_id":"56fdb457c3a36821b6000157","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5594100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2816,"name":"street art"},{"id":160328,"name":"individualism"},{"id":191317,"name":"anti establishment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
