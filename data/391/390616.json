Just off the reservation at Salmon River High in Fort Covington, NY an all-Native girls lacrosse team comes together, seeking to be the first Native women’s team to bring home a Section Championship. But first, they will have to overcome their crosstown rivals, Massena High. As the season comes to a head, the team is faced with increasing ambivalence in their own community and the girls must prove that the game of lacrosse is their rightful inheritance. With more than just the championship on the line, the girls fight to blaze a new path for the next generation of Native women, while still honoring their people’s tradition in a changing world.","popularity":0.0853,"poster_path":"/bd4Y3WpxwkyRMY4imSdibqFaEFz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keepers of the Game","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judd Ehrlich","original_name":"Judd Ehrlich","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/tvsGfEgvwy3N0a87g4lw29YLozn.jpg","credit_id":"56fc5ab3c3a368480f00015f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Iversen","original_name":"Chris Iversen","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5777f12cc3a3686d72001088","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judd Ehrlich","original_name":"Judd Ehrlich","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/tvsGfEgvwy3N0a87g4lw29YLozn.jpg","credit_id":"67d768515addf20955f14c2b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5646004","wikidata_id":"Q24659794","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bd4Y3WpxwkyRMY4imSdibqFaEFz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Tribeca Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
