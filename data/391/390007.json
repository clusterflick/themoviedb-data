His mental images follow each other across the screen, revealing that the women in his life are all the same (different wigs and costumes on the same actress), and his love life never changes either. This sameness can have a dulling effect on the viewers, indicating that if Jean-Baptiste's reminiscences were trimmed and his daydreams more varied and exciting, he would hold interest a little longer.","popularity":0.1744,"poster_path":"/cP5cYsIsN70hhLD5r63GhkaXiAl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S As in...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Curzi","original_name":"Pierre Curzi","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/wVNhAkkVhSwKBaEQR2rNDbZCWcm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56f83982c3a3686a67007e72","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":255382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Daigle","original_name":"Michel Daigle","popularity":0.2701,"profile_path":"/mT7e638PyhxWYj99bcVYgl0PYxg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56f8398c92514123a0000913","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violaine Estérez","original_name":"Violaine Estérez","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56f839929251414c1d00056d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Sabourin","original_name":"Marcel Sabourin","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/ovRLik7TKrgk6K5Rj8aWZgkhH8n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56f8399b9251410c170019bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Tifo","original_name":"Marie Tifo","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/hRpsrTRNJf80ScZnTdRrw5fCPj3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56f839a4c3a3686a5c007738","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Pierre Lefebvre","original_name":"Jean Pierre Lefebvre","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/9z2vY5sjcpIIrHeUmQImGZtboGh.jpg","credit_id":"56f8394bc3a3686a6b0077d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0087510","wikidata_id":"Q12137751","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.651,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cP5cYsIsN70hhLD5r63GhkaXiAl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
