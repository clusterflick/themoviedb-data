Business is good, creative juices are flowing, and yet he suspects there must be more to life. Sagmeister takes on the daunting project of changing his personality by trying to figure out the causes of happiness. On the advice of a trusted psychologist Sagmeister experiments with three different approaches: meditation, therapy, and drugs. The Happy Film follows his pursuit, and all that he encounters along the way: joy, ecstasy, heartbreak, change, love, and death.","popularity":0.4214,"poster_path":"/zJQF7dHru79Z6aPgIKoCTZG64lw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
