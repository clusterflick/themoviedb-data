Tof**k yourself- I want some meat”), Stephen Lynch will always consider himself “a musician trapped in the body of a comedian.” His unique blend of musical based comedy has earned him fiercely loyal fans around the world who live to experience his sold-out live shows, five best-selling CDs, his RIAA-certified Gold DVD and his 2 top-rated Comedy Central Specials. You may also recognize him from his Tony-nominated role starring in The Wedding Singer on Broadway.  Hello Kalamazoo is his first special in over 10 years and was recorded at the end of his Lion tour.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/fnYbZ7TfV6BK2uDdkYtFOCjxGga.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hello Kalamazoo","title":"Stephen Lynch: Hello Kalamazoo","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Lynch","original_name":"Stephen Lynch","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/2muiCwP0hPlsbEhuP5meAkYLAyB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56fdda8fc3a36821b6000a90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Cone","original_name":"Rod Cone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56fdddfd9251412a50000ac9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie King","original_name":"Charlie King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56fdde0dc3a36821a4000b76","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Courtney Jaye","original_name":"Courtney Jaye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56fdde239251416cc2000057","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Fuerst","original_name":"Mike Fuerst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56fdde31c3a36821b6000b7b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonny Jermyn","original_name":"Jonny Jermyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fdde9a9251412a45000b14","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Romeo","original_name":"Kevin Romeo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fdde82c3a36821a7000acb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5596266","wikidata_id":"Q64768622","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fnYbZ7TfV6BK2uDdkYtFOCjxGga.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
