Reset finds Millepied on the eve of his first gala with the Opera, designing and refining his inaugural choreography for the esteemed institution. As a film, Reset possesses of the same artistic assuredness as its subject as he blocks out the preliminary steps for his choreography. It explores various concepts of space simultaneously: the digital space, the space of the opera house (each scene opens with a declaration of which studio it’s in) and the space of the stage, the distance from stage right to stage left. It’s a portrait of a watershed moment for one of the ballet's oldest institutions and one of its brightest new stars, both on the cusp of great transition.","popularity":0.3095,"poster_path":"/uHlmnsHkVXuswm30i4ntcAzvHNy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reset","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Relève : Histoire d'une création","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Millepied","original_name":"Benjamin Millepied","popularity":0.3399,"profile_path":"/dUolMP3dmuks23usx3sRfB8qKqx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57c6e843c3a368329d003769","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Demaizière","original_name":"Thierry Demaizière","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":"/tvYFJ9UHLUrXehhLTl7bKv5vq0r.jpg","credit_id":"56fbdb3cc3a36808c2002aa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alban Teurlai","original_name":"Alban Teurlai","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/hDUK7VWSO7VpuBtWiGz3ERbBTpE.jpg","credit_id":"56fbdb6bc3a36808a70027a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alban Teurlai","original_name":"Alban Teurlai","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/hDUK7VWSO7VpuBtWiGz3ERbBTpE.jpg","credit_id":"59199b0d92514105da04f180","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817196,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alice Moine","original_name":"Alice Moine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59199afec3a36842c105a69a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alban Teurlai","original_name":"Alban Teurlai","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/hDUK7VWSO7VpuBtWiGz3ERbBTpE.jpg","credit_id":"67dc993ec20fb5a418af3145","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67907,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Aviat","original_name":"Pierre Aviat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc9947db76d0433cf2cd1a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1679738,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stéphanie Schorter","original_name":"Stéphanie Schorter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc9959c20fb5a418af314f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5419742","wikidata_id":"Q28869377","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/s6860RHgvM8cPbJMVhQQtvzglbD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1084},{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1262,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/xe16zGh1KiUmNb4qWV8dVaICRCQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1034,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/xJALxYyozQ44djhvj3pXbwgXBfC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":693},{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1108,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uHlmnsHkVXuswm30i4ntcAzvHNy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":742}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10551,"name":"ballet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tribeca Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Reset Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Documentary","key":"6LHpvlPluRg","published_at":"2017-01-14T00:16:57.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"587a3ece9251413f46003027"}]}}}
