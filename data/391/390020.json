Duncan Renaldo, actually Rumanian, starred as the Mexican \"Robin Hood of the Old West\", with Martin Garralaga as his corpulent sidekick Pancho. In the tradition of 20th Century-Fox's earlier \"Cisco\" efforts, our hero comes to the aid of an orphaned child, clears himself of a kidnapping charge, and proves that a \"solid citizen\" is in fact a criminal mastermind.","popularity":0.8079,"poster_path":"/niJSWSC4IQsehOPBH2AEPQiRW8H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"BACK AGAIN!","title":"The Cisco Kid Returns","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan Renaldo","original_name":"Duncan Renaldo","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":"/vusu8EXimaP9o79MH8QDHlnze9O.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Cisco Kid","credit_id":"56f844b99251412fdd0036a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martín Garralaga","original_name":"Martín Garralaga","popularity":0.6112,"profile_path":"/tmXwvyHlxPhfig7qKhzIRxfid3Y.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pancho Gonzales","credit_id":"56f844c59251414c1d00072b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Pryor","original_name":"Roger Pryor","popularity":0.3026,"profile_path":"/hXoJojw09iANxWgIl5DvWncVGV5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Harris","credit_id":"56f844d19251410c17001b3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Callejo","original_name":"Cecilia Callejo","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/1nf6GGqja1vADkEaim6woxVFYEz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rosita Gonzales","credit_id":"56f844ddc3a3686a6700801b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Leiber","original_name":"Fritz Leiber","popularity":0.2443,"profile_path":"/hWMaGqZ2eMAsGlywuytymjx9uKl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Padre","credit_id":"56f844eac3a3686a5c0078b7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Wiley","original_name":"Jan Wiley","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/drTrHUQ3dCzDQNipTr7eiU2E95S.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jeanette","credit_id":"56f844f892514123a0000a5a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98161,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harry Neumann","original_name":"Harry Neumann","popularity":0.1502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d733311283e9004e137500","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philip N.
