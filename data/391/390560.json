The films quickly fall out of synch with one another.  Déjà-vu uses footage from D.O.A. 1949-50, a Hollywood thriller directed by Rudolph Mateé. The film has been transferred to video and is projected simultaneously on three parallel screens at normal speed as well as slightly faster and slightly slower - 25, 24 and 23 frames per second (left to right). This has the effect of making the three identical narratives diverge increasingly over time, and inducing in the viewer an experience similar to déjà-vu.","popularity":0.5759,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Déjà-Vu","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmond O'Brien","original_name":"Edmond O'Brien","popularity":0.589,"profile_path":"/wnB6xci7TzrEHwDYMvLSgY76qie.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56fc230dc3a36808a70030fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Britton","original_name":"Pamela Britton","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":"/dRDBaqZRfyKFSiBf5ZgbM6sVFuY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56fc2316c3a36808ac0034e0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Gordon","original_name":"Douglas Gordon","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fc22ff9251416116000572","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":172446,"name":"parallel story"},{"id":193835,"name":"synchronicity"},{"id":224119,"name":"doa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
