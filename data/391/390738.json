Two artists from Argentina receive a grant to develop their work in Montreal (Canada). The only catch? They have to share an apartment. In this way filmmaker Franca González and cartoonist Ricardo Siri Liniers come to know each other. From the moment González becomes the roommate of Liniers, a friendship emerges between them and she makes him the proposal of doing a documentary about him.  The film starts with an argument to get Liniers permission to chase him with videocameras and ends up becoming one of the most tender portraits ever done of the artist, reflecting the transcendence that ensues from the simple line of his drawings.","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":110228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Franca González Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":5767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Ojo","origin_country":""},{"id":110229,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Desencanto","origin_country":""},{"id":72694,"logo_path":null,"name":"MC Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liniers, el trazo simple de las cosas","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liniers","original_name":"Liniers","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56fd24cec3a36848280029c0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1599025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franca González","original_name":"Franca González","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1oEmO2rkCvEVJOGfNotinguVRzn.jpg","credit_id":"56fd24ee9251412b700008df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1599025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franca González","original_name":"Franca González","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1oEmO2rkCvEVJOGfNotinguVRzn.jpg","credit_id":"56fd250e9251415faa0026e3","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1284155,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lena Esquenazi","original_name":"Lena Esquenazi","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/35mcWdqrhaouIXQ7nud2N9SanLZ.jpg","credit_id":"56fd2544c3a368480f00276a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1638327","wikidata_id":"Q23758647","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":248329,"name":"liniers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Liniers, el trazo simple de las cosas Trailer (Película completa en www.cinemargentino.com)","key":"ralsHyvv8rk","published_at":"2014-10-10T18:57:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bc6742e92514136c1000620"}]}}}
