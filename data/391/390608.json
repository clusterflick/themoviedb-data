He had spent over a decade rescuing children from child sex tourism both domestically and overseas. Though his job was difficult, he was proud that his country was one of very few in the world who was actually doing anything about this problem. However, mired in red tape and bureaucracy, Tim left to begin saving the children that he saw falling out of the purview of the US government. These children constitute over 90% of the children lost to child sex slavery and he could do nothing to help them while in the employment of the US government. This is a story about the lost children and the OURrescue.com jump team's exploits as they investigate and liberate enslaved children from around the world.","popularity":0.8874,"poster_path":"/cTI1d4pipq0gyyBvfaoW7hDO2t1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75470,"logo_path":"/fCDQd6CsmUwuUk20cE0j4DEXr2d.png","name":"FletChet Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Abolitionists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Holden","original_name":"Laurie Holden","popularity":1.0461,"profile_path":"/h0iQdEl4cnxBIhDHepsU9Jy8br7.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"herself","credit_id":"56fdaf6d9251412a420000bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Ballard","original_name":"Tim Ballard","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56fdaf809251412a470000c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Mabry","original_name":"Mark Mabry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56fdaf8c9251412a560000a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krysta Rykert","original_name":"Krysta Rykert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56fdaf9d9251412a420000c1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":76059,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Darrin Fletcher","original_name":"Darrin Fletcher","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fdafefc3a36821a00000bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":76059,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Darrin Fletcher","original_name":"Darrin Fletcher","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570e635692514124e600258f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848002,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chet Thomas","original_name":"Chet Thomas","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59622e8cc3a368293b0ded40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3647434","wikidata_id":"Q18703050","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTI1d4pipq0gyyBvfaoW7hDO2t1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6019,"name":"human trafficking"},{"id":15049,"name":"sex trafficking"},{"id":208458,"name":"trafficking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Abolitionists Official Trailer | The Abolitionists","key":"kFJCC6wYkP0","published_at":"2015-01-20T04:27:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"56fdaeb7c3a36821ab0000a0"}]}}}
