But what does it mean to be released from prison after being sentenced to life? How does one begin to reintegrate into society? The Return depicts the struggles of two newly released former lifers as they deal with restoring relationships, avoiding personal triggers, finding meaningful employment, and managing the mental health problems which had previously contributed to their imprisonment.","popularity":0.1024,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everyo̶n̶e̶ Nation Deserves A Chance At Redemption","title":"The Return","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Duane de la Vega","original_name":"Kelly Duane de la Vega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fa74d6c3a36819300027cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Galloway","original_name":"Katie Galloway","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fa74efc3a36819410027c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5591342","wikidata_id":"Q24660254","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Tribeca Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
