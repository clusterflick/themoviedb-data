He must return home at once to save his kingdom. But a solar storm causes airspace and communications to shut down. No planes. No phones. With the help of a British filmmaker and a troupe of Bulgarian folk singers, the King and his entourage manage to escape over the border. Incognito. Thus begins an odyssey across the Balkans during which the King discovers the real world - and himself.","popularity":0.5107,"poster_path":"/7xExx3AuEvnwZZF3Frlr1kMWNbJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art
