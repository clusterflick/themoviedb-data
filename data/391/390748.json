The post-war Germany is divided into several responsibility zones. Still many Russian people languish in camps located in the American zone. Though former allies are in no hurry to let them off to the motherland, and even try to enroll some of them. The American intelligence agency gets to know that they've got a daughter of one of the West Germany cities commandant, whose brother is a famous soviet rocket engineering designer. They plan a crafty operation on the discrimination of the Russian colonel and introduction of the niece into the uncles design office. The Russian Intelligence service is also aware of the Americans interest in the designers works. The special department colonel Lartsev is coming from Moscow to Germany to prepare a reciprocal operation.","popularity":0.2527,"poster_path":"/agYuhzBSp2vlma9eAliVsBGYKmg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11436,"logo_path":"/oP91a5RrDqF0vYDT09pNKc9dKkf.png","name":"Sverdlovsk Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Game Without Rules","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Kuznetsov","original_name":"Михаил Кузнецов","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":"/ceFF5nxyD4DSWdoo9tl5npoG5lF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"56fd38779251415fa30027a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Dobrovolsky","original_name":"Viktor Dobrovolsky","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/ayrnUqx9vWLdOmDf8NnIPAlMvRC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56ab2bbc86574a032e3683","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vsevolod Yakut","original_name":"Всеволод Якут","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/mHYEVhXEZwsEYJLjhc0mlnSaOMi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56ab384bc38b3503267791","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":549431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Khokhryakov","original_name":"Виктор Хохряков","popularity":0.2495,"profile_path":"/2SAbdWMCspTDiPotLrnYUuqxbOu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56ab40e8131d4a1189bd14","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arkadi Tolbuzin","original_name":"Arkadi Tolbuzin","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/eYpXNzQRY2eXvHhZSKPZq60NnRt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56ab47bc86574b352e0ea4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1311937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Vladimirova","original_name":"Валентина Владимирова","popularity":0.3916,"profile_path":"/sRSqNEIYV9SOXcA6BhG38BBDoms.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56ab58bc86574b352e0ebb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grigoriy Shpigel","original_name":"Григорий Шпигель","popularity":0.21,"profile_path":"/5Tp7jzRuickSe6ifXXpIARW0MxY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56ab5f4bc38b60d42495e1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriy Sarantsev","original_name":"Юрий Саранцев","popularity":0.2093,"profile_path":"/8JfQ6FQ7LBR4MKDI6YCtTE8nJOb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56ab66bc86574b362e182c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yaropolk Lapshin","original_name":"Yaropolk Lapshin","popularity":0.143,"profile_path":"/7wFEzscvVL5YqDRyJ9YNjGD3XSJ.jpg","credit_id":"5d56ab82e8131d3e278b7712","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2036887,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonid Afanasyev","original_name":"Leonid Afanasyev","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d56abc9e8131d4a0389be15","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388566,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vasiliy Kirbizhekov","original_name":"Vasiliy Kirbizhekov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d56abafe8131d3e338b76ea","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419318,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lev Sheynin","original_name":"Lev Sheynin","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/6JiCQO3raHCZc221H27D7J59jOp.jpg","credit_id":"5d56ab92bc86574b362e1854","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0314193","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/agYuhzBSp2vlma9eAliVsBGYKmg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
