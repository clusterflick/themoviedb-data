At the same time, the maid Anna is expecting a child, whose father, Jurgen, works in a sawmill.  When both of them lose their jobs, they fear they won’t be able to feed the newborn.  Thus, they strike a deal with the Petersens, which works for both couples:  Anna and Jurgen will receive a farm from the Petersens, free and clear; and the two will allow the Petersens to adopt the child.  Anna and Jurgen marry and are quite happy; but when the child is finally born, Anna doesn’t wish to surrender him and flees with the child into the Wattenmeer.","popularity":0.2,"poster_path":"/tZSH9cV7XteWW2xGJ2ve6kIbaJT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1934-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother
