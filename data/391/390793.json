But that war - and France's 'year of terror' - began a year ago with the attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.  With unprecedented access to the French authorities and previously unseen footage, five-time Bafta-winning director Dan Reed reveals the untold story of the massacre and of the first Islamic State strike in Paris at a kosher grocery store.  Key witnesses, police officers and survivors - many speaking for the first time - piece together the dramatic attacks and the unprecedented manhunt that gripped the world for three extraordinary and terrifying days.","popularity":0.8068,"poster_path":"/2xF9EI8lmuCAccRYA8TT7tgBUGZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Premières Lignes
