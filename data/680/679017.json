They are climbing the staircase of the town hall to reach the rooms where the wedding ceremony will take place. Earlier, Ursula had stolen the wedding rings as she didn’t trust anyone else to keep them safe, and because she wanted to ensure that her daughter's wedding would be perfect. On the town hall's steps Ursula demonstratively puts both rings on her ring finger while she tries to convince her skeptical sister that the bride and groom are a match made in heaven. Suddenly, the rings are stuck on Ursula’s finger and the panicking best man, Walter, rushes out of the ceremony, followed by his wife, Claire. Walter is desperately searching for the rings. A conflict arises in which insults and animosities between all parties escalate - chaos is inevitable.","popularity":0.0878,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"22 Karat Liebe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunnyi Melles","original_name":"Sunnyi Melles","popularity":0.2509,"profile_path":"/ro6nr4EAYKSrXyuKpACUs0BpMgc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e5a4468357c00001126d8eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1583974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hede Beck","original_name":"Hede Beck","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e5a447066ae4d001484270a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Junge","original_name":"Mathias Junge","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/6AxNXI3q06ukm4EW670DzD9FkgB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e5a44799b86160013f70d4c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2553259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Rees","original_name":"Manuel Rees","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5a444b357c00001126d8cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2553257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lea Najjar","original_name":"Lea Najjar","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5a443c9b86160013f70be6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993231,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Janosch Kosack","original_name":"Janosch Kosack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5a445b9b86160018f75ede","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
