It is a story about dual nature of kings and things and how playing cards came to be. One half of the King represents a barbaric King, a crude but fearless warrior. The other half of his is a King-poet, a man of graceful poise and manners. They share their conscience, but have opposing wishes and desperately want to get rid of each other.","popularity":0.1669,"poster_path":"/nRAV8YL2aRJYZBUK4B5tKqogHV6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129936,"logo_path":null,"name":"To Blink
