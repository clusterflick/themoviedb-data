It is not an introductory piece; no time is given to discussing how to hold the sword, how to generate power in the strike, how to stand and step and move; instead the discussion moves immediately to what is shown in I.33 and how Dave interprets the different wards, techniques and concepts in a logical common-sense system. This is not to say that a beginner would not find this DVD useful, but it is clearly aimed at people who already understand the basics of sword and buckler and who want to look at the I.33 system in more detail.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I33 medieval fighting","title":"Obsesseo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2553469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Rawlings","original_name":"Dave Rawlings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e5a689155c92600154e8d37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2553470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby Manly","original_name":"Toby Manly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e5a689c66ae4d0012847623","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
