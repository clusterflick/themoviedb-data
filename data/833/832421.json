In counterpoint, there are these new landscapes of financial centers, abandoned industrial spaces and wasteland from which we hear the echo of speeches that call to take the train of the new economy. By their simple attachment to a profession which gives them a living, the men and women of the film put up resistance to these slogans. Little by little, a radical rupture is emerging between economic thought and the movement of life. A break that shapes the present time.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/spSlN0EpsUq0N58qxC17Qo0Wxl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Tricycle","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le temps qu'il fait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625497,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francine Poirier","original_name":"Francine Poirier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a97384c6006d0059090baf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Leduc","original_name":"Jacques Leduc","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/loS8GxqZmGvpB8JXyiOx45pSlCe.jpg","credit_id":"60a9734a8dbc330059979781","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103731,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diane Carrière","original_name":"Diane Carrière","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a9735c66e469005ab173e3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Roberge","original_name":"René Roberge","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a9737666e469007b3dddee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194076,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Bertrand","original_name":"Pierre Bertrand","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a973690398ab0077c8615a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","original_name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9GHnEYPzSjWgohVRsbwEOSaLjGy.jpg","credit_id":"60a9727c7f2d4a007dfe8d40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/spSlN0EpsUq0N58qxC17Qo0Wxl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
