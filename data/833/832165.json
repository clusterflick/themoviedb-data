The team members (intelligently stupid) seek out the paranormal and show off their gadgets to catch ghouls. They state their outsider and controversial beliefs on the paranormal and reveal that they intend to exploit the poltergeists. While searching, one crew member becomes possessed (or has just eaten far too many burritos). An exorcism takes place as they intend to expel the burrito demon out of the crew memberâ€™s body.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We like to apologize for any inconveniences caused due to foul language presented in this film, our editors could not get it right.","title":"The Chase Chronicles: Ghostly Encounters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Keophiphath","original_name":"Stephanie Keophiphath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Chase","credit_id":"60a82a347f2d4a005bb1f5aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2909456,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Graham Hartlaub","original_name":"Graham Hartlaub","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"McGeister","credit_id":"60a82a4e85702e002917e1b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2425664,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Sonnack","original_name":"Matthew Sonnack","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sketch","credit_id":"60a82a5f8dbc33007a40d6f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2803155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Schaumberg-Dineen","original_name":"Jake Schaumberg-Dineen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/viGOnYkChutu5izg94WpOjFvRJB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ray-Ray","credit_id":"60a82a19af85de0029d4d23e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2825656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jayce Kolinski","original_name":"Jayce Kolinski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Doubts","credit_id":"60a82a8d5541fa0056df5fc7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3094469,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nat Repinski","original_name":"Nat Repinski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Twitch","credit_id":"60a82abf9a64c100296624d1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyra Arendt","original_name":"Kyra Arendt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Boomer","credit_id":"60a82acf68188800297f2fbb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Jonathan Neuens","original_name":"Max Jonathan Neuens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Maximus","credit_id":"60a82af25541fa003f6a89d5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Keophiphath","original_name":"Stephanie Keophiphath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a82b014b0c63005798b85d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Jonathan Neuens","original_name":"Max Jonathan Neuens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a82b1b501cf2005930478f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2909456,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Graham Hartlaub","original_name":"Graham Hartlaub","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a82b287f4f21002a8f05fb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyra Arendt","original_name":"Kyra Arendt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a82b354b0c63002a8baa2f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyra Arendt","original_name":"Kyra Arendt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a82b5b142ef10040f1b02a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098801,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kyen Ditzenberger","original_name":"Kyen Ditzenberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a82b767f4f21004115e4ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Keophiphath","original_name":"Stephanie Keophiphath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a82b8585702e00580aedef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
