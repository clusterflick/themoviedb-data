Sound","overview":"Dither: The D.I.Y. Sound is not your conventional punk rock documentary. In this documentary we explore the ideologies created by cornerstones of the early punk community such as Ian Mackaye of Minor Threat, Fugazi and Dischord Records. But beyond that, we explore the communities and people that have adopted these ideologies and created their own version of what it means to be D.I.Y. This is not a documentary about just music, it's a documentary about the communities that surround the music and embrace it as a way of identification and brotherhood. But this documentary doesn't just ask questions about the culture, it asks questions about how it's possible to maintain a culture that is, at it's core, so opposite of the modern economic and social system.","popularity":0.2843,"poster_path":"/lW3QJ1yPZZ0m0xttofmT6AA4zoC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary project on do it yourself music; heightening our sense of community and stimulating positive social change.","title":"Dither: The D.I.Y.
