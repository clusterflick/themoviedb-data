However one door in her flat remains closed at all times. Behind that door lives her 21 years old son, Timo. Three years ago he decided to separate himself from the outside world. The only thing left for Brigitte is to wait. To wait for the next Whatsapp message. To wait for a court order that could be an inducement for change. She is waiting for the day the door will finally be opened. Whether that would be for better or for worse.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/bLeVbhW4Js0F3T0NKMA6LeTxN8P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comfort Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3098178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Egert","original_name":"Jonas Egert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7966e4b0c630078d41ad7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3098178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Egert","original_name":"Jonas Egert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a798546ee3d70029412333","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2047057,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Felix Riedelsheimer","original_name":"Felix Riedelsheimer","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a79833142ef1002785ac08","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162686,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julia Furch","original_name":"Julia Furch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a798738dbc3300282a5282","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30371,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christine Haupt","original_name":"Christine Haupt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a798b29a64c10058c37fe9","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098183,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pablo Jókay","original_name":"Pablo Jókay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7988d9a64c10040ba3927","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162686,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julia Furch","original_name":"Julia Furch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7985f4b0c63002a8b0fdb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1644137,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Hutter","original_name":"Philip Hutter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7989b7dfda6004178e607","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3098184,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emilia Möbus","original_name":"Emilia Möbus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a799117dfda6007af10cb0","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098182,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Strüber","original_name":"Stefan Strüber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7987c7dfda6002a7666dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12063334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1575,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pKC6qQdh8ZXzluaOMV7AYfI210.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2800},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1575,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFpjCXeB8DhtB1bkhH8SEAtCR9y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bLeVbhW4Js0F3T0NKMA6LeTxN8P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs","release_date":"2020-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One World Online","release_date":"2021-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
