This fact triggers the decision of a small group of three people to face it. After a first success obtaining an important international media coverage, this law was modified and the MELH (Spanish Movement for Homosexual Liberation) was born in 1970. The MELH team is led by Armand de Fluvià, the true creator of the LGBT movement in Catalonia and Spain. With his testimony, the documentary reconstructs the birth and growth of the LGTBI movement in Spain.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3n0s8JdIuvG9vBpJquNDOZTUjsG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MELH: Armand y la historia de un movimiento","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordi Samsó","original_name":"Jordi Samsó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7e005501cf20026d29514","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Allegranzi","original_name":"Mario Allegranzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7e01485702e00580a9154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carme Porta","original_name":"Carme Porta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7e021bbd0b0005983a218","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramón Martínez","original_name":"Ramón Martínez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a7e06b85b10500797d6f47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dF8v6oGFcqEflGCtN14ISGpQK0I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/3n0s8JdIuvG9vBpJquNDOZTUjsG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
