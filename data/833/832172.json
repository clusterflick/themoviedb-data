N'Eight's drag includes sticking syringes through her cheeks, stapling herself until she bleeds, and eating dead rats. Outside of drag, she works as a mortician and taxidermist. Her drag incorporates and confronts much of the death she sees in her line of work, and evokes many difficult experiences she had growing up in Baltimore. Two years ago, N'Eightâ€™s mother died of cancer, and she is forced to face the reality that despite her celebration of filth, death, and rot, she is not immune to life and death's inevitable sufferings.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":"/qW7iy18UZJ2aAkNxtHP4O4p2jLu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Filthiest People Alive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sextia Neight","original_name":"Sextia Neight","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a837808dbc33007a40e45c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2443234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hollow Eve","original_name":"Hollow Eve","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/65128gQAVAakIwm2lUuTyf69s2k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"641cca33ae6f0900a450c8a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bambi Galore","original_name":"Bambi Galore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"641cca3b344a8e00ba3b9b3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Heckerotte","original_name":"Jane Heckerotte","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"641cca45befb0900bdfb3779","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Roman","original_name":"Jamie Roman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"641cca4c8de0ae007b963aac","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Hedges","original_name":"Thomas Hedges","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a83760fac502007073c9fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14753354","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qW7iy18UZJ2aAkNxtHP4O4p2jLu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Maryland Film Festival","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
