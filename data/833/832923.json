Perpetually shifting surfaces and skins serve as sites of projection and interference, contributing to the further \"queering\" of the state of these bodies and fragments that are stretched and submerged into and outside of the environment they inhabit, as they encounter desire, distress, and ritualized oscillations. Signals generate both sounds and compel movement, the making of the images, and the body further challenges the stability and integrity of the space in its otherworldliness and the spatial relationships it establishes with the audience. At the edge between crisis and satisfaction, the work adopts the role of Millet's own \"gleaners,\" making-do on the boundary between sustenance and the devoid.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/dImykOTeCMLnDKg8ODeC6AkeRrx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the gleaners, and: ritual for signaled bodies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Rosenthal","original_name":"Benjamin Rosenthal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ab6295f859580057b8d252","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Souther","original_name":"Eric Souther","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ab629ef8595800409990ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dImykOTeCMLnDKg8ODeC6AkeRrx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Athens Animfest","release_date":"2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pune Short Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Korea Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"An Ordinary Day Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Performing Media Festival","release_date":"2021-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Transient Visions: Festival of the Moving Image","release_date":"2021-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Frequency Fridays @ The Fuse Factory","release_date":"2021-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"In My Own Skin","release_date":"2021-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kansas City Art Institute","release_date":"2021-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"El Ojo Iluso: Festival de Cine de Animacion","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
