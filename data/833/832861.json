It uses as its raw material television images of the built world and snippets of televised human action and conversation which exists in the world around it. These images, often entropic and chaotic, which range widely in historical time and geographic space, are de-constructed, de-contextualized and re-presented to evoke something of the true experience of perception and metropolis.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/dAxo2mqg1iNRsC7M6o1i1YAe0qP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anti-City: For Johannes Baader","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Breder","original_name":"Hans Breder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gKKpdmu41VnDGnc9Hv61AQFzxyQ.jpg","credit_id":"60ab182d64f71600595acff3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dAxo2mqg1iNRsC7M6o1i1YAe0qP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
