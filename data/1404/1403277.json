They suffered more casualties in one night that in the Boer, Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Through sheer determination, 250 of these fallen, mostly Australian, were unearthed from five mass grave burial pits. These fallen are now being identified through DNA processing and stubborn detective work. This is the exclusive, behind-the-scenes story of the largest excavation of World War One dead in modern times.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":247465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tattooed Media","origin_country":""},{"id":10951,"logo_path":"/jxfMNlkvI3GxnS41xCSOLD7goVb.png","name":"Screen NSW","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2010-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"war, military, history","title":"The Lost Diggers of Fromelles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1063122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janine Hosking","original_name":"Janine Hosking","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5c408e8a1910e6510c89a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4716650","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
