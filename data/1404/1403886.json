Through engaging interviews with animal rights activists and marine scientists, the film explores the physical and psychological dangers that orcas face in captivity. An examination of their natural intelligence and social needs is contrasted with the conditions they live in, leading to a deeper conversation about the ethics of animal captivity and our responsibility as co-habitants of earth.","popularity":0.1178,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fishbowl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jip Koster","original_name":"Jip Koster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67619cc7e1086d94bfb5068b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Lustemberg","original_name":"Lara Lustemberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67619cd0e7c4fdd92dcbe6e6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jip Koster","original_name":"Jip Koster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67619ce01548d87a6ccbf647","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Lustemberg","original_name":"Lara Lustemberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67619cea870cc3c00fb50edc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Lustemberg","original_name":"Lara Lustemberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67619d00e1086d94bfb506c2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jip Koster","original_name":"Jip Koster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67619d0fe7c4fdd92dcbe71b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Lustemberg","original_name":"Lara Lustemberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67619d2d37ee013bdc18a28f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Lustemberg","original_name":"Lara Lustemberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67619d3de1086d94bfb506d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jip Koster","original_name":"Jip Koster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67619d5be1086d94bfb506de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Lustemberg","original_name":"Lara Lustemberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6761a1a637ee013bdc18a4db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jip Koster","original_name":"Jip Koster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6761a1b01548d87a6ccbf7c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9898,"name":"animal rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":["Violence"],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
