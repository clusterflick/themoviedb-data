The G&U also rebuilt their mainline from Hopedale to Milford.  We hop aboard a G&U MP15AC #1160 for a cab ride from Hopedale yard to Milford yard, then we reverse direction and head to Franklin. We then take the head end again and capture the Franklin to Milford on the Milford Running track (Leased from CSX / MBTA)  Then we capture action from the ground as we chase the Hopedale to Milford and the Milford Running track! We also capture Foreign power of the G&U and MBTA detour trains!","popularity":0.1923,"poster_path":"/AvoftMgQEi0kT1ztFyyWlS0Ha7K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247549,"logo_path":"/eCnKVr8rztBWIjB8d1C1TUwnCtP.png","name":"Blackstone River Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":247571,"logo_path":"/sXpJIYcYmBLNIvRLHp0o19nPTzv.png","name":"J&O Railroad Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hopedale to Milford - Milford to Franklin","title":"Grafton & Upton Railroad Volume Five","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5124381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shawn Invernizzi","original_name":"Shawn Invernizzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rmcsqiXDO98eOio5tBQcOoY21Os.jpg","credit_id":"67611e42e7c4fdd92dcbddf3","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5124381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shawn Invernizzi","original_name":"Shawn Invernizzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rmcsqiXDO98eOio5tBQcOoY21Os.jpg","credit_id":"67611e4d9b0cfe05cc189464","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124389,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Beth Steelton","original_name":"Beth Steelton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67611e59cdf1ed2e431894da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124737,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kayleigh Invernizzi","original_name":"Kayleigh Invernizzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67611e6c9b0cfe05cc189471","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124740,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"William \"Cooch\" Couture","original_name":"William \"Cooch\" Couture","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67611e8dd183d1e25ccbddba","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AvoftMgQEi0kT1ztFyyWlS0Ha7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1700,"name":"massachusetts"},{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"},{"id":256087,"name":"trains"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
