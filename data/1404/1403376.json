Biographies, ex-wives or ex-friends talking about him in various themed documentaries, Gainsbourg never lost the spotlight, as if he had died just a few months ago, in a never-ending cycle of life... But never before had her story been told in her own words, rocky, moving, provocative. Thanks to Christian Fevret, founder of Les Inrockuptibles, Serge Gainsbourg recorded the story of his life on audiocassette, for a 7-hour interview conducted in the secluded confines of his Paris home, 5 bis rue de Verneuil, in 1990. Throughout the interview, Serge Gainsbourg never loses his sense of humor or his distance from a life he knows he has lost sight of.","popularity":0.0953,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":92840,"logo_path":"/4LyDs7gsAMq5sg3fPjUa1P52emj.png","name":"Logical Pictures","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":247490,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Jokers Lab","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Gainsbourg, rue de Verneuil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Cayatte","original_name":"Gilles Cayatte","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67608fb5ae81a3e434783728","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2370588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniela de Felice","original_name":"Daniela de Felice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67608fc534475e134c92928b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443261,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Cyril Houplain","original_name":"Cyril Houplain","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67608fcfafafdb2aa649ed79","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4697520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carole Mirabello","original_name":"Carole Mirabello","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67608ffc86258a6fb7637366","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
