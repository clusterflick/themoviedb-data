It becomes obvious that the mysterious poacher, who suddenly appears in the estate’s forest, is not out hunting for a doe but rather pining for one of them.  At the beginning of the 1870s, Smetana faced a rising number of challenges to his position of artistic director of Prague’s opera ensemble. From this tense and pressured period for the composer sprang a work of immense creative grace. He seems to delight in evoking a world of people of refined manners, fine culture and the gentle atmosphere of a rural estate. Perhaps it was a relief from life's difficulties and an escape from everyday dullness - a kind of summer fairy tale with a happy end.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/psc1xkWqZEIxH25G4UF8Pls5Caa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Two Widows - Smetana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4998623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lada Bočková","original_name":"Lada Bočková","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67601ee7673ffea0f27ddf16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronika Rovná","original_name":"Veronika Rovná","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67601ef186258a6fb76362d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Šrejma","original_name":"Martin Šrejma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67601efa207b479919452929","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Gurbaľ","original_name":"Martin Gurbaľ","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67601f03cdfcccba6fc4e452","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122645,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marek Šedivý","original_name":"Marek Šedivý","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67601f12df829c40bcd8daf9","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rocc","original_name":"Rocc","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67601f2986258a6fb76362e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/psc1xkWqZEIxH25G4UF8Pls5Caa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
