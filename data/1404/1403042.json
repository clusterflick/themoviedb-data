She loves the landlady's long, handsome son Slim best, and next to him Glen the lion tamer. Both these gentlemen, sadly enough, love Alice, the pretty star boarder. But things change when it is rumored that Louise is to be an heiress, Both the triflers declare their affection and things seem to be looking up for Louise. This is too good to last, however, and before long she is sent back to the kitchen in a hurry--alone and unloved. But at last she does get the money, then has the satisfaction of spurning both her recreant lovers.","popularity":0.2463,"poster_path":"/pdzTCykPGH21qzIG06RWjZpcabz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kitchen Lady","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Fazenda","original_name":"Louise Fazenda","popularity":0.3299,"profile_path":"/koJe4g2nqMB58S92UUV8Spa4fj4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gwendolyn Hogan - The Kitchen Lady","credit_id":"675fe392de8f34e0b258a6cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Summerville","original_name":"Slim Summerville","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":"/940E4Wlj0XNUgwa1JtR2zRnZuNz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Landlady's Son","credit_id":"675fe3a4de8f34e0b258a6e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Thatcher","original_name":"Eva Thatcher","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qLHFtFMBrKoCoJLOKjD9xa4deXY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Landlady","credit_id":"675fe3b3df829c40bcd8d5a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Cavender","original_name":"Glen Cavender","popularity":0.3429,"profile_path":"/mkCWTmyWtInbtNiSkBaUU20DgXz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Lion Tamer","credit_id":"675fe3c2fbca8e316eab08b6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward F.
