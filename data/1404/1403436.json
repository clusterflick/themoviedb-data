The angriest of them all was Angerbuck. He saved the lemming village many times with his fury. No predator dared to eat Angerbuck. He became a legend. His grandson LUDOLF, however, is a happy misfit of a lemming, dangerously unable to get angry, and considered a threat to the lemming flock. Ludolf is banished and deported to the Anger Academy, where the mad professors train the hopeless students in mastering the arts of angry languages, rebellious math and raging gymnastics as defence against all predators. When the lemming king puts the flock in life threatening danger, Ludolf has to step up and save the day. Anger is no laughing matter.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/bYeXwTSj2k77kxX9wcKShIDK2Ip.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sagatoon","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Ludolf at Anger Academy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2314965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristian Kamp","original_name":"Kristian Kamp","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760a615e602b5d1a4baf975","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2314965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristian Kamp","original_name":"Kristian Kamp","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760a61a2afe5946286be353","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2314965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristian Kamp","original_name":"Kristian Kamp","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760a622e602b5d1a4baf982","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319547,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johnny Carlsen","original_name":"Johnny Carlsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760a62ee602b5d1a4baf98f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319550,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jørn Kolsrud","original_name":"Jørn Kolsrud","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760a63794d207f7c96be294","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bYeXwTSj2k77kxX9wcKShIDK2Ip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
