When local superstition comes to life, Lucia finds herself stuck inside the body of a donkey. From there, our narcissistic diva is set to be taught a scrooge-esque lesson. That lesson will be revealed through Cora, a child who desperately needs a friend in her life - human or otherwise.  What unfolds is an emotional, humorous and heartwarming tale exploring universal themes of friendship and healing.
