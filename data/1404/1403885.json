Morlak, a poet and bishop inspired by the historical figure Petar II Petrović Njegoš, leads his tribe in resisting the invaders. Gravely ill, he is sent to southern Italy in search of a cure. The journey takes him to a house in Naples, a city that contrasts sharply with his homeland’s isolated hills. As Morlak contemplates his existence, his loyal servant Djuko struggles with profound nostalgia, driven by the fear of his master’s death in a foreign land.","popularity":0.2484,"poster_path":"/pvinGmJiXo0M7YZYLnDqK2NNo88.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94623,"logo_path":"/dGklX3sblSTa7E6A1P8Oybffkg1.png","name":"Meander
