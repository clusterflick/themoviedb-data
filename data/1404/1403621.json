Through an introspective narrative, Sebz reflects on the abuse she suffered as a child and the revelation that these experiences were not unique, but also familial. In a space where memory and reality intertwine, Sebz confronts her relationship with her mother, a complex connection torn between rejection and a search for understanding, accentuated by tensions of gender, sexuality and shared trauma.  This short queer documentary is an honest and courageous portrait of wounds, family ties and the resilience that defines those who seek to exist beyond social impositions.","popularity":0.169,"poster_path":"/8iaCSOqNW7ocDLmELtg5epXUmNj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247562,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Diversicats Colectivo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"¿Qué queda de ella en mí para amar odiarnos y vivir amándonos?","title":"I hate my mother and my mother hates me","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebz Palencia","original_name":"Sebz Palencia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sebz Palencia","credit_id":"6760ffc437ee013bdc18938a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebz Palencia","original_name":"Sebz Palencia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760ffe144476b5b60b4f5a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124548,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Salvador García","original_name":"Carlos Salvador García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760fffc44476b5b60b4f5bb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendy Mugno","original_name":"Wendy Mugno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67610030870cc3c00fb4f5ea","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124557,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sofia Vega","original_name":"Sofia Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67610066e7c4fdd92dcbd950","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valeria Arrieta","original_name":"Valeria Arrieta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6761009a870cc3c00fb4f623","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alejandro Perdomo","original_name":"Alejandro Perdomo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676100bd44476b5b60b4f607","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124565,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Orlando Mojica","original_name":"Orlando Mojica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676100d6b80a974245cbd9ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebz Palencia","original_name":"Sebz Palencia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676100eb7bf386051518926a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5124569,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabriela Liñan","original_name":"Gabriela Liñan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676101126162ba96a6b4f402","department":"Camera","job":"Clapper Loader"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/97U0J7pry2dK5L902mNMrCp5oxb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8iaCSOqNW7ocDLmELtg5epXUmNj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"},{"id":272309,"name":"black"},{"id":334957,"name":"mommy issues"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
