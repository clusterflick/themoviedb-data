We learn that express trains pass through Meri without stopping and goods trains slow down, but don’t stop. Only the 7:01 commuter train stops, for just a minute, long enough for the teaching staff to alight. Dedicated to all those who live and work in isolated corners of the country, the film conjures up a small, remote world, virtually unknown to wider audiences.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":155806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul \"Alexandru Sahia\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The School of the Meri Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4373410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Petrovici","original_name":"Jean Petrovici","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67604d8234475e134c9284ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
