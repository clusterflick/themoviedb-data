In tandem with his loyal friend Fred, a cockroach, he has somehow found himself working for a wicked white rat, Walzer, who rules over an empire of hench-animals who dance (Walzer? Get it?) to his tune. Skip and Fred owe Walzer money or their lives will be taken - but across town, Rachel a young rabbit, and her animal friends, also owe money to bailiffs about to destroy their house. Skip serves up a twisting and turning story full of schemes and double-dealings, friendship, emotions, adventure and derring-do, as our hero learns to do the right thing and stand up for what he believes in!","popularity":0.3968,"poster_path":"/yz317QKo7mrK0OgUzjyGhzRdD3V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ulysses Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Skip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toby Genkel","original_name":"Toby Genkel","popularity":0.2163,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760b572669675c5afbaf8f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiron Self","original_name":"Keiron Self","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":"/fCLytYxV7itLyPkNG4vuHsfguYF.jpg","credit_id":"6760b582f7302d06246be035","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giles New","original_name":"Giles New","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/e0Ap9fkLAFcxLVHpK8KH2TQV3wI.jpg","credit_id":"6760b58df7302d06246be040","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1428981,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emely Christians","original_name":"Emely Christians","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760b59af7302d06246be047","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yz317QKo7mrK0OgUzjyGhzRdD3V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
