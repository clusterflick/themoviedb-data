Jupiter pretends to fall in love with Platée only to abandon her once Juno arrives, proving she has no reason to be jealous.  Comedy had traditionally played little part in French opera. Lully soon eliminated comic episodes from his tragedies; from then until the appearance of this work, only a handful of operas had comic themes. That for Platée is the mock marriage between the god Jupiter and an ugly marsh nymph, who is totally convinced of her own charms.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/4ln2zF3tpegwOB2JROnXrAJ0lvP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Platée - Rameau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Waddington","original_name":"Henry Waddington","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67601c2f673ffea0f27ddedc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Murray","original_name":"Robert Murray","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67601c3a86258a6fb76361e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Brown","original_name":"Holly Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67601c45673ffea0f27ddeea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan McGovern","original_name":"Jonathan McGovern","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67601c4ecdfcccba6fc4e3c2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1390908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Agnew","original_name":"Paul Agnew","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67601c5df8631451b37e64c6","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louisa Muller","original_name":"Louisa Muller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67601c6a5bd66a5e58131228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ln2zF3tpegwOB2JROnXrAJ0lvP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
