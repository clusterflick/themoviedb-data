His father is the innkeeper and his fiancée, Mania, is a serving maid. As innkeeper, his father is given a hard time by all the drunkards and, to defend his dignity, he claims that he is untouchable, ‘like a king’. But will a ‘royal wedding’ between the prince Henryk and Mania manage to restore the family’s honour?  The Marriage (Ślub) is an opera adaptation of the eponymous play by Witold Gombrowicz, one of Poland’s leading dramatists of the 20th century. Poznań Opera House has commissioned this operatic adaptation from Zygmunt Krauze, for his part, one of the leading composers active in Poland today.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/b7KvAzD0Z9Xan49pxiBCGruggmh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marriage - Krauze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3481413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michal Partyka","original_name":"Michal Partyka","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67602290ae81a3e434781c60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Kalina","original_name":"Piotr Kalina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67602298207b4799194529ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gosha Kowalinska","original_name":"Gosha Kowalinska","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"676022a0ae81a3e434781c69","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Łukasz Konieczny","original_name":"Łukasz Konieczny","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"676022a8207b4799194529fe","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krzysztof Cicheński","original_name":"Krzysztof Cicheński","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676022bad6bbb70fffb28cbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122682,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Katarzyna Tomala-Jedynak","original_name":"Katarzyna Tomala-Jedynak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67602324a8d0eb560faa7a2c","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b7KvAzD0Z9Xan49pxiBCGruggmh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
