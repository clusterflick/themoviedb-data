Then came a great cataclysm that split the world in two – the Neon City of Lights where the Neocats have lost their connection to nature and the serene dark Wild Forest inhabited by the spiritual Wildcats. This left the cat world broken and out of balance.  Our story begins with the street thief Katsuo who is believed to be the fabled “chosen one” destined to return harmony to the world by reuniting the ancient artifacts of yin and yang. Join him on an epic journey as he discovers himself and the role he’s destined to play in this fantastic furry world. Is he truly the chosen one? Or will he prove the naysayers right and fail his ultimate test in the high-stakes game of ‘Ninja Cats’ where the prize, determines the very fate of Catworld!","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/9o6naffVSubkc24rGmBqzjuNMTF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ionart Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":247524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Derengő Animation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Ninja Cats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1095804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Csaba Bárdos","original_name":"Csaba Bárdos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760b0df94d207f7c96be6d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1095804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Csaba Bárdos","original_name":"Csaba Bárdos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760b0e86b430b2454191e92","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5123903,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark A.J.
