Probably good acoustics. But that doesn't rescue this perfomance of the Requiem mass, the fault is mainly being the conductor's, Yuri Temirkanov. He doesn't at all seems inspired of this work and not interested in whats happens on stage, if judged by the video. Particularly, he seems unintersted in the choir. The tenor, Francesco Meli, delivers a very inspired Ingemisco, but the other soloists are probably affected by the conductor.","popularity":0.1765,"poster_path":"/3mSZpTtCNjAG7sOrWaTch9tgEVI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42411,"logo_path":"/9osTYTduHkM6Il6XixUTfdNcaoP.png","name":"C Major Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi Requiem","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Meli","original_name":"Francesco Meli","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/1lnXvITG0C1CPUHPvQ3Om9StJnp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5de7d3faa7e363001472452c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1383470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitra Theodossiou","original_name":"Dimitra Theodossiou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qzQ2cKeBPSp4sLG4jVNdpMqiKeV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5de7d46b3faba0001514c5f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1202406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Ganassi","original_name":"Sonia Ganassi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/AnBgLKGrOXqmYQCc6vCtrjVXUaN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5de7d4823faba0001914539a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Zanellato","original_name":"Riccardo Zanellato","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lL1cLRwiPNVPYaKXv4tyBP9Zk0i.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5de7d4967646fd001599540d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1766497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Temirkanov","original_name":"Yuri Temirkanov","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/8AzsJoD6yX3dnajGji5WkYwBz3Z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5de7d4b111386c0013560ef8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiziano Mancini","original_name":"Tiziano Mancini","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/kfowQbHkoA32VPcuqxVNacnVncc.jpg","credit_id":"5de7d4d17646fd001399a759","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5de7d4dea313b8001491be77","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11132512","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3mSZpTtCNjAG7sOrWaTch9tgEVI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"la","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
