A young athlete Yaroslav is not happy in his life: boredom and routine of daily workouts, need of constant self-control, etc. But most of all he is concerned about a strange feeling he has for men. Only his close friend Andrew seems to understand what is happening to him. For Yaroslav it's difficult to admit that he is a gay. Internal problems become external: he fights with a member of the national team and is on the verge of scandalous charges. He is referred to a psychologist who gently opens his eyes to himself.","popularity":0.1256,"poster_path":"/q6xJzprxM1CmCjGcM8zy1bI8rfc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Times About It","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"TRI RAZA PRO ETO","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2082962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Vasileva","original_name":"Olga Vasileva","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/zqA66By4ftC6sfCNUTGnu7RPGPk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7cd403faba00013137624","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitaly Kucheravenko","original_name":"Vitaly Kucheravenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7cd67a7e3630019720f6e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2349893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seva Galkin","original_name":"Seva Galkin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7cc913faba000131374a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valery Pecheykin","original_name":"Valery Pecheykin","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/bSpp52IdSKEYqsPq5YNnFlqeP1Z.jpg","credit_id":"5de7cd84a7e3630019720f91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2122516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJ4g5k3jF8XvrHeDPDsAH1bBM3H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q6xJzprxM1CmCjGcM8zy1bI8rfc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THREE TIMES ABOUT IT — film by Seva Galkin","key":"ZSZ0ndEFkmg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-28T20:33:35.000Z","id":"5de7cdbfa313b8001891ccd1"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Teaser Three times about it","key":"oePZ2ZYQAkQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-04-04T21:03:43.000Z","id":"5de7cf847646fd001198ea94"}]}}}
