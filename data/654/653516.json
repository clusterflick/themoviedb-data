Rarely performed to this day, this heroic-romantic opera has now been staged for the first time ever at the Salzburg Festival by famous director Peter Stein. Based on an old French 12th-century epic, the plot depicts the military conflict between Christians and Moors at the time of Charlemagne – as a backdrop to stories of love and friendship that prove to be stronger than war and hatred of otherness. The strong cast includes the “marvellously expressive miracle Dorothea Röschmann” (Die Zeit) and “Michael Schade, who exudes his exceptional tenor in Fierrabras’s heroic arias” (Der neue Merker). Under the energetic baton of lngo Metzmacher, the Vienna Philharmonic unfold “the melos, the poetry, the sweetness and the dramatic force of Schubert’s highly refined and atmospheric sound worlds” (Kleine Zeitung) in highly romantic fashion.","popularity":0.1311,"poster_path":"/1BrVgJ6Ny9xNuirrmQT9FqzlLzo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71713,"logo_path":null,"name":"C major","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fierrabras","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schade","original_name":"Michael Schade","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fierrabras","credit_id":"5de7e0f23faba00019146d32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Kleiter","original_name":"Julia Kleiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"5de7e1097646fd0015996fa4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Bernheim","original_name":"Benjamin Bernheim","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eginhard","credit_id":"5de7e119a313b8001491d4f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothea Röschmann","original_name":"Dorothea Röschmann","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/xrVdPsmL4rVDnKNgAF4XMaOcMrU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Florinda","credit_id":"5de7e129a313b8001491d4ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Werba","original_name":"Markus Werba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Roland","credit_id":"5de7e13611386c0016561142","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1559109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Zeppenfeld","original_name":"Georg Zeppenfeld","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/k8Nd6GsmwGirrDUIK51aC0SNRQB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Charlemagne","credit_id":"5de7e1447646fd0011990065","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Claude Chappuis","original_name":"Marie-Claude Chappuis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gXOyiHhnNYhnusiFANXQZXbxJPR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Maragond","credit_id":"5de7e15211386c0011558537","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Walser","original_name":"Manuel Walser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Brutamonte","credit_id":"5de7e15ea313b8001491d594","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Staatsopernchor","original_name":"Wiener Staatsopernchor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63751f477a1bd60082228f23","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63751f3a57d37800abb578ca","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Stein","original_name":"Peter Stein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7e66aa313b8001891ff98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Metzmacher","original_name":"Ingo Metzmacher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7e17f11386c0011558575","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franz Schubert","original_name":"Franz Schubert","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/mu0lM6bf1qO0DvFPBe8DgtCR46N.jpg","credit_id":"5de7e93e3faba00019147384","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1BrVgJ6Ny9xNuirrmQT9FqzlLzo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Schubert's Fierrabras conducted by Ingo Metzmacher","key":"NJOO-1ODqTc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-09T11:12:28.000Z","id":"5de7e3d811386c0011558adc"}]}}}
