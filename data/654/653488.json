Millions of people believed she possessed paranormal abilities.The first part of the documentary portrait of the prophet Baba Vanga not only as a mysterious supernatural figure, but as a living and immediate person. The second part follows the discussion between prominent Bulgarian scientists and intellectuals who, with few exceptions, completely reject Vanga's abilities and advise the film to be reworked with a view to a materialistic understanding of man. The two parts contrast Vanga, the crowds of visitors to her home and the stiffened way of thinking of the representatives of science in Bulgaria in those years. Forbidden to the general public after its first screening.","popularity":0.5678,"poster_path":"/fGJHjp0EYe3qLl2qDsvURLcKpHR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bulgarian Television","origin_country":""},{"id":126117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofia Press","origin_country":""},{"id":97993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Interfilm","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1977-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phenomenon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Fenomen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2475034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baba Vanga","original_name":"Baba Vanga","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/vpbYgUsSX83JLhqDZekk4u8i1A3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7bc38a313b8001891a839","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikola Shipkovenski","original_name":"Nikola Shipkovenski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7bc5711386c001355e732","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilyan Ganchev","original_name":"Lilyan Ganchev","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7bc6ba7e363001671fafa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasho Bozhinov","original_name":"Sasho Bozhinov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7bc87a7e363001671fb24","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Temkov","original_name":"Ivan Temkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7bc96a313b80012919233","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgi Lozanov","original_name":"Georgi Lozanov","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5de7bcaaa313b80014919e4a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zhanna Stamenova","original_name":"Zhanna Stamenova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7bd1ba313b80014919ec2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475041,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jordan Stoyanov","original_name":"Jordan Stoyanov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7bd0111386c001655ce1e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikola Shipkovenski","original_name":"Nikola Shipkovenski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7bcd3a313b800129192b4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2475034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baba Vanga","original_name":"Baba Vanga","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/vpbYgUsSX83JLhqDZekk4u8i1A3.jpg","credit_id":"5de7bce37646fd001198d702","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475043,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniela Kazandzhieva","original_name":"Daniela Kazandzhieva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7bd30a313b8001291939e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475044,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dimitar Hadzhiev","original_name":"Dimitar Hadzhiev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7bd487646fd0013998302","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nevena Tosheva","original_name":"Nevena Tosheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de7bcc0a313b80012919284","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0291904","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6rfDPInkfzAj9kRle70Fq4rNtYr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fGJHjp0EYe3qLl2qDsvURLcKpHR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":530,"name":"prophecy"},{"id":241580,"name":"mysticism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
