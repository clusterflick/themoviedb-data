In a fascinating shot lasting almost 12 minutes, we watch this girl-braids, red dress, white knee socks, fighting against the wind-as she experiences her moment in the spotlight. We can't see what's written on the sign because she's being filmed from behind. Armed with cameras and cell phones, the people around her are taking countless photos and uninvited selfies with her. As the minutes tick by, our unease grows. Placed in the role of an ignorant spectator, we have time to contemplate the omnipresence of the camera-and we become desperate to know what's written on that sign.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/6EPl93AXY3qQkA2rNkTOdKez3tx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140749,"logo_path":"/DYbFDlsONhCIUy578IXX1N7DMX.png","name":"Escuela Internacional de Cine y Televisión (EICTV)","origin_country":"CU"},{"id":124652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haver Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2017-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2443261,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matheus Mello","original_name":"Matheus Mello","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/wWCrPVsoPvhDBVEGFZjSJRwtMDr.jpg","credit_id":"64e1e0d9076ce843b652dcc4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3248558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cássio Kelm","original_name":"Cássio Kelm","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/w3Esb8aNrqbRlABs1AYzldrICl.jpg","credit_id":"61c28dc954508d009c7630d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7689142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6EPl93AXY3qQkA2rNkTOdKez3tx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2017-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
