Through his lifestory, some of the most important events of the 20th century are explored: from fascism to liberation, from migration towards America to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The legendary figure of Joe was unjustly tainted for years by betting scandals; but Giuseppe Esposito represents an exemplary figure for the city of Naples: a man of humble origins who fought to build himself a future, succeeding in resisting and fighting against all adversities of an unfortunate destiny.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ar9JwIcbjrdqfxboxyp64ZBJIQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bull of Pallonetto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2474458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Barletta","original_name":"Luigi Barletta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de6e9823faba0001311c1fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5730722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ar9JwIcbjrdqfxboxyp64ZBJIQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
