In 2011, she was acquitted on the basis of DNA evidence but prosecutors successfully appealed and her acquittal was struck down. In 2014 she was again found guilty in absentia after a retrial and sentenced to 28 years and six months in jail. The saga came to and end when Italy's highest court overturned the convictions of Ms Knox and her former boyfriend, Italian student Raffaele Sollecito in March 2015. Known burglar Rudy Guede was arrested a short time later following the discovery of his bloodstained fingerprints on Kercher's possessions. He was later found guilty of murder in a fast-track trial and is currently (as of 2019) serving a 16-year prison sentence.","popularity":0.2765,"poster_path":"/2CiGKp2t1e35wZ6cMokr1XdwoGN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":32491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peacock Films","origin_country":"EC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Amanda Knox Saga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Is Amanda Knox Guilty?","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1689396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Knox","original_name":"Amanda Knox","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":"/vKfoY0khRYP0rdYKs4soLXyOi5o.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dea1d1811386c001659cc87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Lumumba","original_name":"Patrick Lumumba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dea1dc811386c001659ce7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuliano Mignini","original_name":"Giuliano Mignini","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f8a940724de1007a016436","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudy Guede","original_name":"Rudy Guede","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":"/xZxytpoucS8eb0wOM0yYMjLSRai.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dea2213a313b80012956a78","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliana Olivieri","original_name":"Liliana Olivieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5dea203211386c001359bced","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Daheley","original_name":"Tina Daheley","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/9cGG0MD75doN00bVbEHMgyBTo0w.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5dea1d2c27d9cc0013ea3ed8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":369420,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Mudede","original_name":"Charles Mudede","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self -
