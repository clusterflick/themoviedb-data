The orchestra then went on the road to perform the unique work in Quebec’s Far North, stopping in Kuujjuaq, Salluit, Kuujjuarapik, Oujé-Bougoumou, Mashteuiatsh and Maliotenam. Far more than just a concert film, Chaakapesh puts the audience front row centre as artists and communities come together in a remarkable cultural space. Poignant testimonials, important discussions and Maestro Nagano as we’ve never seen him before.","popularity":0.2233,"poster_path":"/xOXDNcF5KXWAxjQvpdL4zKoDp9q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chaakapesh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kent Nagano","original_name":"Kent Nagano","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/rghOfYl9H5zMgfGqJdWSCZtPS8U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5de6ed4ecf4b8b001827426f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2474481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomson Highway","original_name":"Tomson Highway","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5de6ed570cd44600143e16d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florent Vollant","original_name":"Florent Vollant","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/4CxdkPjopLwSwUzRvsy2OidLrwk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5de6ed5f7646fd001397c164","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2474482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akinisie Sivuarapik","original_name":"Akinisie Sivuarapik","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5de6ed687646fd001397c189","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2184086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Kingsley","original_name":"Justin Kingsley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/dqXjuhS1tGh1IRGEJXOZsXjiGIJ.jpg","credit_id":"5de6ed9c0cd44600193e2503","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Frappier","original_name":"Roger Frappier","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/kYh5KSknAQf7JQ4lRDd59UmQVFw.jpg","credit_id":"5de6ed877646fd001397c1ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Frappier","original_name":"Roger Frappier","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/kYh5KSknAQf7JQ4lRDd59UmQVFw.jpg","credit_id":"5de6ed8ecf4b8b00112784ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1137706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xOXDNcF5KXWAxjQvpdL4zKoDp9q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinéfest Sudbury","release_date":"2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
