A colonel briefs a command board on the problems inherent in the initial bomb-loading processes and the losses and injuries resultant from those processes. He then informs the board as to the development of new model hoists for loading bombs. The commanding general asks for approval from the board, and following input from an AAF tactical officer, the new hoist is approved.","popularity":0.385,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bomb Loading Procedures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reed Hadley","original_name":"Reed Hadley","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/jOt6OKSEuvwNuKA3KmCaXhN6f2I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tactics Colonel","credit_id":"5de6af0aa7e3630014703d48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Smith","original_name":"Kent Smith","popularity":0.5709,"profile_path":"/2GHATvR422EaWU7BkSoj9kbgzt0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Briefing Colonel","credit_id":"5de6af1811386c0011538521","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8779008","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
