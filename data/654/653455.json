The crow, eyeing the fox as a sucker, passes his island home off as \"Treasure Island\", assuring the fox it is loaded with gold (which he proves by showing the fox phoney gold bricks which are really construction bricks painted yellow). However, there is a $2.00 fee for digging on his island which the fox refuses to pay. He tries to extract the \"gold\" by himself but the crow sabotages his efforts. First, he removes the blade from the fox's pickax.","popularity":0.073,"poster_path":"/xSICpIqgjbiwc09HohYChpVJYTI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treasure Jest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Graham","original_name":"Frank Graham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/eyk6QL2NR8Ay4AlrAHYyqcRtMqY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fox / Crow (voice)","credit_id":"5de78f51a7e363001671a966","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Swift","original_name":"Howard Swift","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de78f367646fd0013993c9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0149288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xSICpIqgjbiwc09HohYChpVJYTI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
