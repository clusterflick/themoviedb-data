A hero of the 1953 Coronation Cup winning side, top goal scorer in Celtic's 1954 league and cup double as well as scoring a brace in the record-breaking 7-1 cup final of 1957 against arch rivals Rangers. Neilly went on to become a trusted lieutenant of Jock Stein after hanging up his shooting boots and was Celtic's first team trainer throughout the nine-in-a-row era when Celtic were feared throughout Europe, winning their most glittering prize in 1967 on an unforgettable afternoon in Lisbon.
