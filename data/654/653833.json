Gabriël is a lad of about eight, probably a foundling, who lives in a convent, the only child among about 20 nuns. Except for Sylvia, a young nun, Gabriël doesn't get on well with others. He thinks of himself as an angel, impatient to grow wings and to fly, impatient with earth's rules. He's been collecting feathers from the many geese on the convent grounds. What happens next seems to horrify everyone except Sylvia, who may be in on Gabriël's secret.","popularity":0.1167,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinepolis Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gabriel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Walgraven","original_name":"Kai Walgraven","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gabriël","credit_id":"5de998283faba0001517d15c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Przybylek","original_name":"Magdalena Przybylek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sylvia","credit_id":"5de99835a7e3630019755f4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Van Langhendonck","original_name":"Greta Van Langhendonck","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/nq22UQb1KXb15epqYGOGV2WyEtO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Abbess","credit_id":"5de998443faba00013162df6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nand Buyl","original_name":"Nand Buyl","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/izeAwwlTZ0LTiBKJIfj8GmBmMfd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"John","credit_id":"5de9984f27d9cc0013e94bed","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618148,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bo Spaenc","original_name":"Bo Spaenc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de997c4a7e363001674f4e8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476151,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucas Jodogne","original_name":"Lucas Jodogne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de997cfa7e363001474e3d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427506,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renaat Lambeets","original_name":"Renaat Lambeets","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de997efa313b80012947902","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renaat Coppens","original_name":"Renaat Coppens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de9979da313b80018949f17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125624,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joris Brouwers","original_name":"Joris Brouwers","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de997da11386c001658edd4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331238,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siska Leemans","original_name":"Siska Leemans","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de9988127d9cc0013e94c59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geert Bert","original_name":"Geert Bert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de997b87646fd00159c2106","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0233767","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
