To finance it? To be respected by her team? Does she have a different way of looking at the world? Does cinema have a gender? In our two previous documentaries, we had already asked these very contemporary questions to 20 female and 20 male directors in France. But we have been eager ever since to expand the borders of our work, to question women filmmakers around the world. That is what this film has achieved, from Asia to Africa and Europe… All the women we met were funny, sincere, committed, concerned, and all looking for the best possible way to exist in an environment always governed by men. All FilmmakErs and living witnesses of the dysfunctions that still exist in the film industry.","popularity":0.2275,"poster_path":"/6SgalIBjdfgc96kesPYPVLC5rSm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FilmmaKErs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Busson","original_name":"Mathieu Busson","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/ji2ZTxlsnABveqMICajGYYMG61z.jpg","credit_id":"5dea78ceafa1b00019c11101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Gayet","original_name":"Julie Gayet","popularity":0.4068,"profile_path":"/wt2ZtI2RFcOWcaUoXp8O5jv1bmx.jpg","credit_id":"5dea78c4af6e940017a89f9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6SgalIBjdfgc96kesPYPVLC5rSm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
