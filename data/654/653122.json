Unlike the wishes of her husband, In-gyu, who has a business running resorts, they don't have a child yet. They've tried test tubes and home remedies, but nothing has worked.  Her husband and her in-laws finally decide to get a surrogate mother, and Min-ji has no choice but to agree to it, as she is worn out from their pressure. Hometown friend Jeong-ah comes knocking on the door. Min-ji is uneasy with Jeong-ah around, as she knows her past secrets, including the time she lived with someone else and had an abortion. On the other hand, In-gyu has completely fallen for bold and sexy Jeong-ah. Like a crow that nests in another's nest, Jeong-ah takes over Min-ji's place slowly and gradually. Min-ji is driven into a corner, so she meets Jeong-ah's husband, Joo-sik, to stop her. However, she falls for his trap and is used to replace his wife who ran away from home.","popularity":1.0196,"poster_path":"/Aol6g6M4YlvE2GPPcmiP6zb9ZWT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Have Two Wives","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1907997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Min Do-yoon","original_name":"민도윤","popularity":6.4059,"profile_path":"/bHHn3krbHyxQIWb4JbHkPlV6Uu1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5de652220cd44600193d3aa9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2472255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoon Young-gak","original_name":"Yoon Young-gak","popularity":0.1523,"profile_path":"/y6EAVNprnbEdeUXlcowbZ4PEfbs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5de6522d3faba0001310ebf3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2374721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Han Seo-ah","original_name":"Han Seo-ah","popularity":4.9436,"profile_path":"/hfcHoS3o2sCLkZHJpqcnSIDaEav.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"630d336163536a007d477372","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2578378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Im Cho-hee","original_name":"Im Cho-hee","popularity":2.2558,"profile_path":"/4x5I4R6jDEcwPoPZnetzPA57ZNd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"630d3366028f14007e918153","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1755041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Han Dong-Ho","original_name":"Han Dong-Ho","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/jV2BePpAPJ5aJq0LP02rKPvMazP.jpg","credit_id":"5de652460cd44600193d3af2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gMfYQARMy3QESlGpCyAy8LarKM9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1054,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/Aol6g6M4YlvE2GPPcmiP6zb9ZWT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":740}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155477,"name":"softcore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"19+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
