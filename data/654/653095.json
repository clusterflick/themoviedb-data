The story attempts to reconstruct a particular biblical passage that was given prominence in the Old Testament (Genesis 37-50) centered around the first Joseph’s, parts of the so-called Egyptian episode and the incident in Potiphar’s house (Genesis 37: 36 and 39: 1-23). Although in the biblical story there are no great details about such episode they can be easily imagined, as Strauss and Hofmannsthal did in fact; please refer to Genesis 39: 11-19 for more specifics.","popularity":0.2919,"poster_path":"/aspvptecvPnBTbqYcDSLquoqUxW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Strauss - Josephs Legende","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1226872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Jamison","original_name":"Judith Jamison","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/6g5mITQzdzfTgZoKi6YQTEQDBQv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5de636193faba0001512264f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Haigen","original_name":"Kevin Haigen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5de6361f7646fd001596bedf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Musil","original_name":"Franz Musil","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5de636270cd44600123d4080","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Hollreiser","original_name":"Heinrich Hollreiser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5de6362d0cd44600143d1dc4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Wilhelm","original_name":"Franz Wilhelm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5de636323faba00015122668","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188766,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Neumeier","original_name":"John Neumeier","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":"/mAKpaiKDisBlWbmnQu6xXFxJosn.jpg","credit_id":"5de6363fcf4b8b0013264179","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1485,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aspvptecvPnBTbqYcDSLquoqUxW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":990}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
