Vanga meets the tragic fates of different people, to whom she inspires faith and comfort. At the same time, with her own funds, she built the church \"St. Petka\" in Rupite, painted by the artist Svetlin Russev. The film was shot for years until the last days of the prophetess, leaving it to mature in the minds of the authors and is dramatically meaningful with the attitude towards it and with today's view of the presented events.","popularity":0.2936,"poster_path":"/n1G4sstUMEUVm6dYy01pT8J5HQn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artazy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2003-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thus Spake Vanga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Assim falava Vanga","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Tui reche Vanga","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Thus Spoke Vanga","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2475034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baba Vanga","original_name":"Baba Vanga","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/vpbYgUsSX83JLhqDZekk4u8i1A3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5de9078611386c00115788a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rossen Elezov","original_name":"Rossen Elezov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5de9079c11386c00165818cc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rossen Elezov","original_name":"Rossen Elezov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de907b2a313b8001293b590","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rossen Elezov","original_name":"Rossen Elezov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de907c17646fd00139beceb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toma Tomov","original_name":"Toma Tomov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de907d73faba00015170d58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475861,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nikola Todorov","original_name":"Nikola Todorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de907ee3faba00013155d0b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11390562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqaRNtFrIrxDWz0zXrgROL5DF4Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n1G4sstUMEUVm6dYy01pT8J5HQn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9681,"name":"clairvoyance"},{"id":167696,"name":"healing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
