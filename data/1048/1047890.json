Online solutions such as Zoom helped groups socially, but did not allow a choir to rehearse and perform together. Several tech-savvy musicians turned to old-school audio technology to organize parking lot choirs, with each singer safely isolated in their own car. The idea spread through social media across the US and Canada, and reached the attention of the New York Times, the Today Show, and NPR. \"The Drive to Sing\" tells the story of the parking lot choir, the cast of characters who worked together to develop and refine it, and the singers who kept their musical communities going during this time of fear and isolation.","popularity":0.2333,"poster_path":"/bMLEi19p7cV7moAWaUkiacXebRx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When COVID-19 halted choir singing in 2020, groups across the U.S. and Canada turned to \"car choirs\" to stay connected and keep their music alive during this time of fear and isolation.","title":"The Drive to Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell J.
