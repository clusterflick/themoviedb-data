Through the eyes of nine thirteen-year-olds, we see how pressing social, geographical and political challenges are shaping, and being shaped by, young people: rising anti-Semitism in Europe, guns in America, gender identity and racial divisions across Australia and Asia. With no adult commentary outside the filmmaker, Dear Thirteen offers an intimate view into the universal uncertainty inherent in growing up.","popularity":0.6519,"poster_path":"/k3PxUmQDII8R7o9sdmwJ53lpOm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Thirteen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":175821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Neophytides","original_name":"Alexis Neophytides","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f5cd79bcd0f007c8c8d55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":175821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Neophytides","original_name":"Alexis Neophytides","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63748f5e57d378007c67c02a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033170,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trina Rodriguez","original_name":"Trina Rodriguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63748f7657d37800e9c8e590","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033170,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trina Rodriguez","original_name":"Trina Rodriguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63748f7dc995ee00d55a0602","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":175821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Neophytides","original_name":"Alexis Neophytides","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63748f66229ae200dcaa536c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Murawski","original_name":"Alex Murawski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6374909e229ae200dcaa5429","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583871,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Deacon","original_name":"Dan Deacon","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":"/yONiUqo763K3wRtmqHZkeckEuFA.jpg","credit_id":"66eb51ec5c0519a234d3af6c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22802210","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"dear.thirteen","instagram_id":"dear.thirteen","twitter_id":""},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4dzF2pZFETNFrZdyVqfRT5J3PIu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k3PxUmQDII8R7o9sdmwJ53lpOm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1438,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aWTouiEOaR4Msyruk6ay7OU5FAh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":958}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1293,"name":"asia"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"},{"id":261480,"name":"youths"},{"id":274920,"name":"jewish"},{"id":280268,"name":"international"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dear Thirteen – Trailer","key":"397452487","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-13T15:36:32.000Z","id":"637491627a1bd6009b02ea2e"}]}}}
