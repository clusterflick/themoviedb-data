He was a lookout in a bank robbery that ended up in a chilling loss of innocent lives. He has become aloof, and unlike the other detainees, he never had any visitor. Argel religiously dials 1430 and pretends to be talking to a person on the other line. In reality, it’s just a dial tone. But one day, someone suddenly speaks on the other end of the line.
