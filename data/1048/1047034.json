With a tradition of blending Chinese dance and ballet together in the training, the dance company has set sail to re-evaluate its artistic essence by adapting new physical disciplines and philosophy, picking up different cultural traces, meditation and Chinese martial arts. Through monologues of the company members, the film unveiled their fears, self-doubts, and findings in their quest to refine their dance forms and express their cultural roots. It's an uncertain journey towards the cultivation of inner peace and the essence of movement and stillness.","popularity":4.0648,"poster_path":"/58nbWOCbdIOpO4MJ2viBZt7OboM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147318,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Priori Image","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stillness in the Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheuk Cheung","original_name":"Cheuk Cheung","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wPIx2Akmhn64pYh0d8W12VWhHrQ.jpg","credit_id":"636e1ca521621b00cd621e55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23341966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y1c3MSmBTJvbD3quidVlmZc6kXL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xyNmpVW5GieUA43qy2ASEbH6B0J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/58nbWOCbdIOpO4MJ2viBZt7OboM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1364}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":779,"name":"martial arts"},{"id":780,"name":"kung fu"},{"id":1346,"name":"dance performance"},{"id":1532,"name":"meditation"},{"id":163210,"name":"choreography"},{"id":235797,"name":"dance film"},{"id":255129,"name":"chinese art"},{"id":297031,"name":"chinese mythology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Jumping Frames International Movement-image Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
