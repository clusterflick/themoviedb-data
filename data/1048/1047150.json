Its striking story is the story of the ebb and tide of Spanish immigration to this country; of the rise and fall of New York City as home to the American Dream, and the tale of hundreds of lives touched by the possibility of a new life. Yet that story of immigrants to America, so relevant today, remains a mystery to most New Yorkers and Americans.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/kRJLDmydok7LUkzK6YThaOXNwT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon A Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Érase un ligar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Celia Novis","original_name":"Celia Novis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e6a6a2495ab0082317521","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Celia Novis","original_name":"Celia Novis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e6a9a2495ab008231752f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Celia Novis","original_name":"Celia Novis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e6a2b2495ab0078214c89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15424958","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1348,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KH7N2ehLH6ZG23VeJRuCOnWCGw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2397}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1063,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kRJLDmydok7LUkzK6YThaOXNwT9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
