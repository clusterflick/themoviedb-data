Six weeks later, 40 percent of the population was infected, making it the worst COVID hotspot in the country. Sickness in the System shows the San Quentin outbreak from the inside by combining phone interviews with incarcerated people with performances by actors and hand-drawn illustrations. Through two menâ€™s stories, we see how the virus came to San Quentin from a botched prisoner transfer and quickly spread through open-air cells, packed showers and poor management. As the pandemic rages, both men fear for their lives, but they meet very different fates when the California Department of Corrections begins releasing inmates to combat the crisis.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/lq6Jt5NeHu1B77YahEeGaxDLAJ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sickness in the System","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3783118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Gibel","original_name":"Bryan Gibel","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637029ac02842000dcaaf941","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4513470,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raaghav Minocha","original_name":"Raaghav Minocha","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/385Soivk7K18NFLg6K5vFprfX9p.jpg","credit_id":"671aa763c7802cc50359e0b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lq6Jt5NeHu1B77YahEeGaxDLAJ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Field of Vision - Sickness in the System","key":"770878852","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-14T20:01:03.000Z","id":"671aa8f2c7802cc50359e550"}]}}}
