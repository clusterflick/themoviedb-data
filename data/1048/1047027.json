With over a hundred Tin Hau temples (Goddess of Sea) in Hong Kong, there are three on Lamma Island alone, located respectively in Sok Kwu Wan, Luk Chau and Yung Shue Wan. The film documents the states of Tin Hau temples on the island and beyond, as an attempt to contextualise the everyday practice of the fishing community, islanders and city dwellers visiting the temples.","popularity":0.3425,"poster_path":"/gUjiSwD6k2dMMOECXRFfAoSpfkb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147318,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Priori Image","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Wish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheuk Cheung","original_name":"Cheuk Cheung","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wPIx2Akmhn64pYh0d8W12VWhHrQ.jpg","credit_id":"636e18421684f700c4ea5312","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23338790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ZdaW56GODggPrK1u4Q8FdQnfSp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/gUjiSwD6k2dMMOECXRFfAoSpfkb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1364},{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rgfX7KbEGyQYrSzaJzhChaUdE2F.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":777}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2041,"name":"island"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":177588,"name":"religious statue"},{"id":211349,"name":"religious community"},{"id":222311,"name":"islanders"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"MOViE MOViE Life is Art Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
