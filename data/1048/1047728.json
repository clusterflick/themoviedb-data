It was linked to the French franc when it was introduced, so the national bank in Paris controlled monetary policy. Now the currency has a fixed exchange rate with the euro. The link with the European currency strongly influences the monetary policy of CFA countries. And that means the value of the CFA franc is defined by political decisions taken elsewhere, rather than by the domestic economy.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/g2VecsjK4FKdDplAEFPAWqDjKXX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103451,"logo_path":"/vAn1QQPkeK217gMKaCPiWoK1Jp4.png","name":"Tact
