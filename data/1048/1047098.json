The woman was asked deeply inappropriate personal questions about her sex life, menstruation and her mental health. The officers dismissed her claims and told her directly that they didn’t believe her. The film instigated a public outcry and as Graef noted on BBC Radio 4’s Front Row in 2014, the ‘film came after three very controversial rape cases the week before and the police quietly changed the way they handled rape.’","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Complaint of Rape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217655,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles Stewart","original_name":"Charles Stewart","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6439bf3ad7dcd204e0eaea08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
