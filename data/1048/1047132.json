A combination of shot footage and found audio, BULK COLLECTION was filmed on a Iphone 8 over a two year period. It is a diary and time capsule of digital gentrification--a New York City of ubiquitous mega construction sites, constant demolition, and the socio-economic fallout of the COVID regime. The construction of the massive new Downtown home of Disney's 650-million dollars headquarters at 4 Hudson Square--which Masha Tupitsyn filmed for over a year--the COVID-19 breakout in spring 2020, and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, all coalesce into a temporal record of the cultural wreckage of a physical world that was destroyed because no one was paying attention.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":187,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bulk Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Tupitsyn","original_name":"Masha Tupitsyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e5cbfd7fbda008875acf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
