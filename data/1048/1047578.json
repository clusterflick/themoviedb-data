That wasn’t necessary, as the trauma of war is clear to see on everyone’s faces, including those of the volunteers who rushed in from far and wide to help.","popularity":0.1861,"poster_path":"/oDXJPXUFfjnCUjdTeYI6SqVf1Ai.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":186038,"logo_path":null,"name":"wildfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Spring Came to Bucha","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128246,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcus Lenz","original_name":"Marcus Lenz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/dTYyEyjL55fDX4uheEdhYnB80xR.jpg","credit_id":"636fb0d3d7fbda00bb9018b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128246,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcus Lenz","original_name":"Marcus Lenz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/dTYyEyjL55fDX4uheEdhYnB80xR.jpg","credit_id":"636fb0e02495ab00b4747063","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128246,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcus Lenz","original_name":"Marcus Lenz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/dTYyEyjL55fDX4uheEdhYnB80xR.jpg","credit_id":"636fb0e72495ab007821b86a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3782531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mila Teshaieva","original_name":"Mila Teshaieva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636fb0f4ca4f67007fc2d0ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3782532,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evgenia Danilenko","original_name":"Evgenia Danilenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636fb0feca4f6700bbbf8f5d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":61757,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julia Wiedwald","original_name":"Julia Wiedwald","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636fb107172d7f009cc0f9c8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4008698,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitaly Garkavyi","original_name":"Vitaly Garkavyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64382314c2679600981bcde3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4008685,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marina Orekhova","original_name":"Marina Orekhova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/c9gpbVqpPbmb3LocHMWhaoTnCHK.jpg","credit_id":"64382332ab6849009825a3e5","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23133150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fo0qPuJz8R7EL9fas4rGDShLhTI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oDXJPXUFfjnCUjdTeYI6SqVf1Ai.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Storyville","release_date":"2023-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Diaspora Film Festival","release_date":"2023-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Festival Amsterdam","release_date":"2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IDFA 2022 | Trailer | When Spring Came to Bucha","key":"pp8NDQpvx3A","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-23T10:10:38.000Z","id":"645f6d08dbbb4200e22c5a8b"}]}}}
