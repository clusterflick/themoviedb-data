The surfers will chased the biggest storms that cross the British Isles for three months. The highlights of these sessions was definitely Aileens, which was huge. Mickey Smith shot the water footage off the back of a ski with his camera protected by nothing more than a Tesco bag. I was supposed to go out too, but it was so big I went and sat on the cliffs holding a mobile ready to direct pick ups or call in search and rescue. I was convinced if the shit hit the fan someone would get badly hurt. Luckily the lads all worked together amazingly. The buzz after was unforgettable.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2tzfCm7uYtqOHZfFDUh5DBygxKc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The H30 Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22335028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2tzfCm7uYtqOHZfFDUh5DBygxKc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
