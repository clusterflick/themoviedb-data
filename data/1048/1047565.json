We find out how in 1982 David set about popularising the Cybermen after their seven year absence from Doctor Who.  Shot on location at the Theatre Royal, this Myth Makers also gives a glimpse behind the scenes of Doctor Who: The Ultimate Adventure in which David played Karl the mercenary leader. We find out about some of the problems that arise when you bring the famous Time Lord off the television screen and onto the stage.","popularity":0.1076,"poster_path":"/nGsw7qhgXA3JcLdKZgJyDR3dDRa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 20: David Banks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Banks","original_name":"David Banks","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/Io4Y9qIJs3qZlJ9yx5CHMEuiEs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"636fabb381383100b511c2e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Briggs","original_name":"Nicholas Briggs","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/7QUxZVfw8WqUSxPVHrhmRtXGFUl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"636fabb92495ab00b4746e9c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3782512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Neville","original_name":"Chris Neville","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636fab828138310080852715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187330,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Barnfather","original_name":"Keith Barnfather","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/nc5XBOgyj8cy4R6t4d9Ilf3Rl6h.jpg","credit_id":"636fab93ca4f6700c68d8cd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340425,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Ayres","original_name":"Mark Ayres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cZKMNWorQ7oODs0rrOuZTykAteL.jpg","credit_id":"67e6dfc12e72ba2f7625cd4e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":808,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nGsw7qhgXA3JcLdKZgJyDR3dDRa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":548}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
