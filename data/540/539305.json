In 2006, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the creation of Candide, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris produced a new production under the direction of Robert Carsen. The production transforms the proscenium into a giant 1950s-era TV set, and has Voltaire, appearing as the narrator, changing channels between certain scenes. Carsen sets the action in a 1950s/1960s world, with an American slant commenting on contemporary world politics. This production was filmed and broadcast on Arte.","popularity":0.0691,"poster_path":"/loPxTl9gHCFvIUff44yq0ux70iZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Candide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Burden","original_name":"William Burden","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Candide","credit_id":"5b5fac109251411824001609","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Christy","original_name":"Anna Christy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cunegonde","credit_id":"5b5fac270e0a263fb30018b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lambert Wilson","original_name":"Lambert Wilson","popularity":0.9949,"profile_path":"/5Fx2vg8Qux0LcOFLAGJK6VzET.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pangloss, Martin and Voltaire","credit_id":"5b5fac4b0e0a263fbc0017e5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Carsen","original_name":"Robert Carsen","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/ffsRQfAAVpOPuzHChuZjEbBcefJ.jpg","credit_id":"5b5fab4dc3a368583c00188a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/loPxTl9gHCFvIUff44yq0ux70iZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
