When construction of a high-rise block was abandoned in Caracas in Venezuela twenty years ago, nobody dreamed this building would one day become the world's tallest squat. This film provides an empirical, fractal insight into everyday life, exploring the hierarchies and intellectual life of the people who live there. The film also enters into a dialogue with the architecture of a tower which was once designed as a financial centre and now accommodates a parallel society.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/6vDyFkuDVYhWCNb1pYERIVN8aid.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A City within a City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"cylixe","original_name":"cylixe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b60d69bc3a368188d0057b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2718742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6vDyFkuDVYhWCNb1pYERIVN8aid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
