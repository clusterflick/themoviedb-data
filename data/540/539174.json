This time, Leung puts on omega hair and woman's clothing, posing as a rich woman in order to help his two friends get love. Liu is equally amusing, sharing the dance floor with Leung in a hilarious dance scene. Loosely based on the British play Charley's Aunt, the film is a delightful comedy on grassroots, offering a refreshing alternative to MP & GI's usual line of comedies.","popularity":0.2822,"poster_path":"/abBFPsfnv7L5PqaAvvPBUNTTjFV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture & General Investment Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Love Affair on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Pai Lu-ming","original_name":"Christine Pai Lu-ming","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5f28f592514152310462d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2095760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chung Ching","original_name":"Chung Ching","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/jyIwF4QEVlJXOliZGvxt7ohAbR2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5f29030e0a262e9804a303","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Lai Chen","original_name":"雷震","popularity":0.3126,"profile_path":"/6RrS6v8ayfdLFSTSOK7BhKZRKXr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5f290ec3a368421e0543fe","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Tin-Lam","original_name":"Wong Tin-Lam","popularity":0.4826,"profile_path":"/nNw8LwY3rcrIQKUPbSnBHBhiiUi.jpg","credit_id":"5b5f292c0e0a262e8d04ebe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38282,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eileen Chang","original_name":"Eileen Chang","popularity":0.3051,"profile_path":"/sBBY5OFQGwiRqNjbCLnLPBgsPBB.jpg","credit_id":"5b5f291d0e0a262e9f049b46","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0198806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1236,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/abBFPsfnv7L5PqaAvvPBUNTTjFV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":844}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
