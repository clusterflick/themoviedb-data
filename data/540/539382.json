But that is not counting on Escopette, an opponent of bullfighting, who kidnaps the bulls. What further complicates things is that the appointed bullfighter, Chico de Granada, takes the French leave with Violette, one of Cabissol's daughters. As a measure of retaliation, Cabissol decides to force Escopette to replace Chico in the arena. Fortunately, Rémy, the head herdsman, comes to his rescue. Finally, everything goes well and Cabissol is so happy that he gives Rémy the hand of Marguerite, his other daughter.","popularity":0.1979,"poster_path":"/s2AbOeXI6q2oI8zhSwceJVkq2j2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arènes joyeuses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Baroux","original_name":"Lucien Baroux","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/blftA0eD70wfOY9kYZLV5beixBs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61f640475f2db100a2a63347","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Stockfeld","original_name":"Betty Stockfeld","popularity":0.1475,"profile_path":"/95VeGsQbrIe8xJr2NfXAiKg2QeY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6404b81140f00ee4aebaa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Alerme","original_name":"André Alerme","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/3a5WCqZkPBKWmph6yfnh5WC7kAm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6405437b3a9006c52ad05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":534896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisette Lanvin","original_name":"Lisette Lanvin","popularity":0.2832,"profile_path":"/lKDv0MMK0RQIEznFEGxrjzO5KhB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6405ae9da6900c42892ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Alibert","original_name":"Henri Alibert","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/dLcP5ELklyVKhTyQmjKqozD4Ss0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61f64065e4886000d54a8d81","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rellys","original_name":"Rellys","popularity":0.163,"profile_path":"/RP9LJz9xXZBN3Wo7akJhY4bDP0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6406fc5ada5001c2b57df","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Medina","original_name":"Rafael Medina","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61f64077ac8e6b006f32e507","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1896219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Mussine","original_name":"Marthe Mussine","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61f640830284200069915347","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":633308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Callamand","original_name":"Lucien Callamand","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/ei4MD1659Pf1kIAo2CnKBNFVmL6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61f64086e48860001e0b06b9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sinoël","original_name":"Sinoël","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/1A6Pj9Oa4CylXPuxN7Xxe3fTDdk.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6408b6331b20093a39f2f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Mariotti","original_name":"Frédéric Mariotti","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/lBQj3Az9Kyv5P3RJXqNIfzYfk6M.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61f640946dc50700f340b9a0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cécile Lemaire","original_name":"Cécile Lemaire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6409cbb105700a0af2646","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernand Charpin","original_name":"Fernand Charpin","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/til2Tyu3BWeZ3ObIkp0cYKuCjqQ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"61f640a7e9da6900f4381dbf","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Oudart","original_name":"Félix Oudart","popularity":0.3099,"profile_path":"/fu2jViAASFh52j7m7V4vY2qVAXz.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"61f640ab7776f00068c02c52","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Anton","original_name":"Karl Anton","popularity":0.337,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5ffcb80e0a263fc000754a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0131809","wikidata_id":"Q2866163","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.637,"height":1099,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/s2AbOeXI6q2oI8zhSwceJVkq2j2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
