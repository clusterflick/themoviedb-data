In this special, Cher finds herself trapped in a strange building, where various fantasies await her behind every door. The memorable opening number “Aint Nobody’s Business” sees Cher on a tour of fashion from Eve in the Garden of Eden to disco at Studio 54 all while parading in dozens of stunning Bob Mackie creations. There's also a roller skating fantasy sequence and a second Garden of Eden moment when Andy Kaufman shows up as Adam and Cher plays the snake. Elliot Gould guest stars as a painter who resides in the building, Shelley Winters turns up in a skit about acting and Lucille Ball plays a cranky old washerwoman. To date this is Cher's last traditional variety-format special. The program was nominated for a 1979 Primetime Emmy Nominee for Outstanding Costume Design for a Limited Series or a Special for Bob Mackie and Ret Turner.","popularity":1.697,"poster_path":"/qy3Ooiwe2dtD4NR1Jm9Lm8GKFjT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How can you refuse?
