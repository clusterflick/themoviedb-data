This time, the two plump stars play owners of competing restaurants—Cantonese cuisine in one and Northern cuisine in the other, of course—whose rivalry heats up when their respective children decide to get married. While the script by Eileen Chang cleverly uses the two regions' foods to bring out clash of cultures, the film's title already says that it is ultimately a heartwarming film about two decent men who must put petty arguments aside for their children's happiness.","popularity":0.4141,"poster_path":"/fGU4vx0rP4j0EyV5dZizMd8Tk5W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture & General Investment Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Wedding on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1669030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Ching","original_name":"Cheung Ching","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":"/fEsyuhej2omj8p5sMwTt8ICWCxt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"667c07fe3d702e52c55579af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1495066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitty Ting Hao","original_name":"Kitty Ting Hao","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/A8H8cdmjIP2SSSFOP3DZLJ31DJV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65d2c919f495ee01633f8b56","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Pai Lu-ming","original_name":"Christine Pai Lu-ming","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5f2377c3a3684221055ba5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638345,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yifu Qin","original_name":"Yifu Qin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5f2390c3a368422a043918","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38282,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eileen Chang","original_name":"Eileen Chang","popularity":0.3051,"profile_path":"/sBBY5OFQGwiRqNjbCLnLPBgsPBB.jpg","credit_id":"5b5f239e0e0a262e9004ece1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Tin-Lam","original_name":"Wong Tin-Lam","popularity":0.4826,"profile_path":"/nNw8LwY3rcrIQKUPbSnBHBhiiUi.jpg","credit_id":"5b5f23ad0e0a262e98049a1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0198807","wikidata_id":"Q85876782","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fGU4vx0rP4j0EyV5dZizMd8Tk5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
