Tales outlines the tremendous importance and impact of Winnipeg on the national filmmaking scene. Packed with rare archival footage, dynamic film excerpts, and hilarious interviews, this documentary traces the history of the legendary Winnipeg Film Group. We hear candid behind the scenes stories that illuminate the storied rise of acclaimed filmmakers like John Paizs (Crime Wave), Guy Maddin (Tales From The Gimli Hospital, My Winnipeg) Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan (We’re Talking Vulva, Good Citizen, Betty Baker) and Caroline Monnet (Ikwe). Often mired in controversy, the Film Group has been acclaimed at film festivals around the world – attested to by several Toronto film luminaries in the film – for subversive, original filmmaking. This documentary continues that tradition of bold, exuberant work.","popularity":0.215,"poster_path":"/ldqRZYOv5KsbxdNJbGEG6RsoASn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales from the Winnipeg Film Group","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Maddin","original_name":"Guy Maddin","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/hF15rfnugsLQJfa6R1AvVAX7bEu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c86b6530e0a264301682357","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222730,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Klymkiw","original_name":"Greg Klymkiw","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c86b65f0e0a26431067e108","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noam Gonick","original_name":"Noam Gonick","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c86b66692514129191f2dc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piers Handling","original_name":"Piers Handling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c86b6999251412766238670","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":554480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoff Pevere","original_name":"Geoff Pevere","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c86b6a2c3a3687f84d39cb9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5de55e220cd44600193b97bc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danishka Esterhazy","original_name":"Danishka Esterhazy","popularity":0.2163,"profile_path":"/pCtkWryYpBoT59JF0H2HcME4Vhx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef2a391907f26003684cde2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmen Lethbridge","original_name":"Carmen Lethbridge","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef2a3a49cc67b0034bb9e1d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milos Mitrovic","original_name":"Milos Mitrovic","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef2a3ab6beaea0035522d3f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2672555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Solomon Nagler","original_name":"Solomon Nagler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef2a3b762fcd30033cee4cc","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2095953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Barber","original_name":"Dave Barber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sbVaIQ8kdQRxWt8TRq0TaN1ZjcH.jpg","credit_id":"5b5f6711c3a36835740055fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Nikkel","original_name":"Kevin Nikkel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5f66b5c3a3683577003cd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.688,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zJKyBXXYM9jpCCJw4ECpSIaAXhq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":516},{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1055,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ldqRZYOv5KsbxdNJbGEG6RsoASn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
