On the other, the Frankfurt School dialectics of Alexander Kluge, self-proclaimed arrière-guard eternal of 1960s modernist moviedom, Gandalf of all essay cinema. For Happy Lamento, Kluge mixed some of his weirder TV skits on electricity, the circus, revolution and early cinema (featuring Fassbinder-regular Peter Berling, theatre genius Heiner Müller, and DaDaism’s last man standing, Helge Schneider, among others) with some of the more outrageous scenes from Khavn’s 2016 Ang Napakaigsing Buhay Ng Alipato. Some 2017 G20 shots of Merkel and Trump et al inject the already heady brew with current affairs urgency.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":"/yiBEL1a7kJcdqc64WDmLiRqErXx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Lamento","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","credit_id":"5b635d9a925141404f031dc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"5b938be20e0a261987005c22","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","credit_id":"5b938bf392514143280054b0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"5b938c050e0a261987005c41","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10544158","wikidata_id":"Q63868935","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/yiBEL1a7kJcdqc64WDmLiRqErXx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1334,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/e7vcDZYUkywmdgoOJ3VbZhnKozm.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":889}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
