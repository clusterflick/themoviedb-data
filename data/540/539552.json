He leaves her a few months later to marry Cécile Breton. The years go by. Jean becomes an important businessman. One evening, he meets Roberte, who has become the wife of a wealthy American. She does not love her husband any more than he loves his wife. They recall their memories. They seem to still love each other. They plan to rebuild their lives. Together, they will spend a few days in Dieppe, as they did in the past after their first meeting. They feel so different from what they were twenty years ago that they understand that the past cannot live again.","popularity":0.3764,"poster_path":"/7qzB6Amp4YDynqWSpSix0xgI54Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eureka Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1934-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Not Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaby Morlay","original_name":"Gaby Morlay","popularity":0.2068,"profile_path":"/uwfwwKDOpuMlUYIcWDs7Hqwr68Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Roberte","credit_id":"61f468229a3c49001bdc4f9c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Dauphin","original_name":"Claude Dauphin","popularity":0.2269,"profile_path":"/1Phmm4zdV1gX3R3Gbjz5W4m2DBq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean Servin","credit_id":"61f46826bb105700a0ab93b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Wall","original_name":"Jean Wall","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/uYPmbv1FOKNrVtXvMDn0TergrrI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roger, the friend","credit_id":"61f4683110923000420dee40","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Larquey","original_name":"Pierre Larquey","popularity":0.2587,"profile_path":"/hXNfCJTnejlhSXqwTA3K4qkKdcn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Breton","credit_id":"61f468354fd141001ec4fd36","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Léon Arvel","original_name":"Léon Arvel","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/lE2sBAMl3rt8prPFthRlMxEuriC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61f4684115794a00b7cd2d87","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelle Monthil","original_name":"Marcelle Monthil","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/kKMIxcrkUf6OdgznRTRkMRUVDMC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61f46845109230001b36e682","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Carton","original_name":"Pauline Carton","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/nTNyvSDiLcxvdIqWW6drpKH5N2A.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61f46851028f1400446a1a82","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3402832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Drines","original_name":"Yvonne Drines","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61f4685a4fd141009e669e3a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":545468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Guitty","original_name":"Madeleine Guitty","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/wVRcNQ0eJMc6HvDZFwOsg4l2S9a.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61f468674fd141001ec4fd7a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucienne Le Marchand","original_name":"Lucienne Le Marchand","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/3ZjCFZl0YUuUmgG8Xrb7WPtrvsz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61f4686b64de3500ee8b0111","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1409763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Myral","original_name":"Nina Myral","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61f46873d71fb40068fbeab7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1869484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Houry","original_name":"Henry Houry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/fLDPZbRcrFfGZHDEnojPzVPiHZP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61f4687815794a00e506fd18","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Augusto Genina","original_name":"Augusto Genina","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/7aJfxyxkA7KjsbrHDAEWXSwTy5x.jpg","credit_id":"5b60eaf90e0a267eeb007d68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0161871","wikidata_id":"Q16028750","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7qzB6Amp4YDynqWSpSix0xgI54Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
