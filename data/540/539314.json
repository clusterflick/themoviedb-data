New Lafayette (or NLT) had been founded by actor-director Robert Macbeth the previous year, with the aim of producing theater for black people, by black people, to reflect the experiences and vernacular of the Harlem community. Within the Black Arts Movement, NLT would become a significant institution: it published the journal Black Theatre, and employed a host of talents – including the Black Panthers’ Minister of Culture, Ed Bullins, and the great pianist Junior Mance, both of whom appear in Wildenhahn’s film as resident collaborators.","popularity":0.3281,"poster_path":"/anHt1wbW2JBQQ74yE7KkfIpDd70.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harlem Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":90188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert MacBeth","original_name":"Robert MacBeth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659fa64e27db610121984f19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2765071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Bullins","original_name":"Ed Bullins","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659fa6581bf8760130ac6b94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Seale","original_name":"Bobby Seale","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/6SlILVsBPsjk2QofEVaV2VipmPw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659fa68f945d360121aea3be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":171269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvette Hawkins","original_name":"Yvette Hawkins","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659fa69f27db61012d984f7c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3336487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Miles","original_name":"George Miles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659fa6c22e06970121745112","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Bolling","original_name":"Gary Bolling","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/xi1HOdjqM4yxuuX22rAAhq4BRhw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"659fa70027db610127984db6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estelle Evans","original_name":"Estelle Evans","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/3gQscVyZ4W7k7jLGAgv6TDWvKQm.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"659fa714907f26012520e1f0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Kirkpatrick","original_name":"Peggy Kirkpatrick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"659fa73b2e06970127745130","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe Orman","original_name":"Roscoe Orman","popularity":0.2399,"profile_path":"/xslKXOC0xrhq04il4VqAfzVbiR1.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"659fa75b27db610124984ed4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Cardwell","original_name":"Carolyn Cardwell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"659fa76d945d36012daea455","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Blackwood","original_name":"Christian Blackwood","popularity":0.1776,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659fa5f127db610121984f03","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","original_name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5fca48c3a3685842003f65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","original_name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfaa82fc3a36813a602b8ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0194935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/anHt1wbW2JBQQ74yE7KkfIpDd70.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":628}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
