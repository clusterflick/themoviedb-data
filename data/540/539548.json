By the late 1970s, thousands of peasants in northern Morazan organized to resist National Guard repression which often involved torture and executions. In 1980s, the military engaged in scorched earth operations against their villages, inaugurating a 12-year civil war. The Word in the Woods tells their stories. The film's protagonists must reflect upon their struggles in the light of current reality.","popularity":0.1913,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Word in the Woods (La Palabra en el Bosque)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","title":"La Palabra en El Bosque","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096940,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ygor de Gondaria","original_name":"Ygor de Gondaria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b60e40e0e0a267eed007792","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096941,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ramses Calderon","original_name":"Ramses Calderon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b60e417c3a36818860084ea","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096939,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paolo Hasbun","original_name":"Paolo Hasbun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b62368a925141405c01dbf5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096929,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guillermo Escalon","original_name":"Guillermo Escalon","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6236a2c3a3681888020265","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Gould","original_name":"Jeffrey Gould","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6236f2c3a368189701e98c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Henríquez Consalvi","original_name":"Carlos Henríquez Consalvi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b623723c3a36818880202fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Henríquez Consalvi","original_name":"Carlos Henríquez Consalvi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b623799925141406801e54e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3215900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15126,"name":"historical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
