One day, she asks Jim Ashbury to intervene and this is how the son of a wealthy lord gets involved in the life of a pretty Jane Doe. Charmed by Ginette, Jim invites her to a cruise on the Mediterranean. It does not take long before Cupid sends his arrows at the two young people but things are not so simple for all that. Jim indeed fears Ginette might want to marry him for money, which is totally wrong. Fortunately, Lord Ashbury manages to persuade his stubborn son of his error.","popularity":0.2039,"poster_path":"/yt1D4dcR0snksBxtOPRhgtdH7l9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vogue, mon coeur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Lefèvre","original_name":"René Lefèvre","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":"/dT03avNRH43YG9YzmPNgTRmo9Mm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6394dbb105700d3035b46","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Vattier","original_name":"Nicole Vattier","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61f63954cedac4006cd0444e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Lysès","original_name":"Charlotte Lysès","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/qnjKDdtSJ0UZyIIy8mJ7K9nNCUa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6395cdfaae9001db67628","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Roussel","original_name":"Henry Roussel","popularity":0.1869,"profile_path":"/wZ51WKjddk4DghQhgXkzeLnf7Ya.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61f63962dcf875001b93ee64","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Tissot","original_name":"Alice Tissot","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/8WZGSLi8NdkIB6lsmGvXUHO2fcS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6396e15794a0090ca32a3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1896219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Mussine","original_name":"Marthe Mussine","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61f639717776f000919d6a67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berthe d'Yd","original_name":"Berthe d'Yd","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6397abb105700a0af1e04","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3201418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Véra Markels","original_name":"Véra Markels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6398359e8a9009250748a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude May","original_name":"Claude May","popularity":0.1677,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6398c57d3780065c1e7c5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2441407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Maury","original_name":"Jacques Maury","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/jLxSb91Q1p8EIssiRSLAPxFUYz8.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"63021b367d41aa0081538705","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1151380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abel Tarride","original_name":"Abel Tarride","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/ayTNDiB6VsH4BehANVAkJSzwPjN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61f63999dfaae9001db67632","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Rémy","original_name":"Maurice Rémy","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":"/5Nxw6AjREty046dBzlsRL0OEhoM.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61f6399ddfaae900f5dc36d9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Sloux","original_name":"Guy Sloux","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nV8CQuUZzW831P3A9rmgSlL4mJD.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"61f639a86331b200ef0d7702","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":633308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Callamand","original_name":"Lucien Callamand","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/ei4MD1659Pf1kIAo2CnKBNFVmL6.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"61f639abc5ada500681c4ad5","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Daroy","original_name":"Jacques Daroy","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5f5bdbc3a368357c003e37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0178974","wikidata_id":"Q30728545","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yt1D4dcR0snksBxtOPRhgtdH7l9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
