It uses prominent music by Goblin, from other composers too and itÂ´s his only one that was made in original Dutch language. The idea of plot wafts around a book that may have the power to call up the flesh loving undead, inspired by \"Evil Dead\" and the work by George Romero.","popularity":0.2412,"poster_path":"/eQtahpM3SoW7XrhAXblxPoCrvnI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1984-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pandora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Truus van Triest","original_name":"Truus van Triest","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Female","credit_id":"5b60ba1c0e0a267ef1003f89","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim Vink","original_name":"Wim Vink","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b60ba330e0a267ef4003d5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tCYj2SpHwoFlcGYGbB7Ok4RyNrh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8go0aCYByrHWmsVPJOcjjCHy8hc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nwDWKSordAnN95zh7qMvzUSiV7P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tn9HKHVGYuVDEZXncJ5imTQap1e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eQtahpM3SoW7XrhAXblxPoCrvnI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12377,"name":"zombie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1984-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
