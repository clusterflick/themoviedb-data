She was three. She was taken away from her family and lived her entire life not knowing who they were. In 2009 her son, Marcos Reyes Villatoro, searched the entire country for the family. His search for the Reyes family is more than curiosity; it's his obsession. Like many Latinos in the U.S., Marcos has the need to know on a deeper level, What does it mean to be Latino? He searches for his roots. And what he finds is not pleasant. His family was involved in the Salvadoran struggles in a way he'd never dreamed.","popularity":0.2055,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamale Road: A Memoir from El Salvador","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Camino Tamalero (\"Tamale Road\"): A Memoir from El Salvador","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle McPeek","original_name":"Michelle McPeek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b60d6af0e0a267eed006512","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin James McPeek","original_name":"Benjamin James McPeek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b60d62d0e0a267ef800645e","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096760,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles L.
