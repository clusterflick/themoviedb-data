Filled with hydrogen and manned by a German crew, the ZR-3, later renamed Los Angeles, flew 5,000 miles in 82.5 hours to Lakehurst, New Jersey in October, 1924. During its life, it logged 4,398 hours and 331 successful flights. Still in good flying condition, the Los Angeles was decommissioned and scrapped in October 1939, after the longest career of any rigid airship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1924-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dirigible Los Angeles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
