Both are foundational to our faith and shape our worldview. Start your thinking on the rock of Godâ€™s Word.  The Creation Museum. The Ark Encounter. Christmas events. Speaking engagements. Everything that Answers in Genesis does is done for one purpose: to show people that the Bible is clear and can be trusted from the first verse to the last verse. It is clear about the history in Genesis and the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Creator and Savior, that is based in that history.","popularity":0.0522,"poster_path":"/9cdO13gp38ZbYIXCJoBsLOJgsZR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beginning With Genesis","title":"The Clarity of Scripture","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Ham","original_name":"Ken Ham","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"619ada1496033100918e1d3e","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cdO13gp38ZbYIXCJoBsLOJgsZR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
