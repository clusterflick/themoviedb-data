Unaware of her son’s death, Kamal Matmati’s mother would still go above and beyond for years, trying to reach him with letters and clean clothes. Thirty years later, a trial is held addressing Matmati’s death at the hands of the Ben Ali regime. The mother is asking for her son’s corpse so they can give him a proper burial. Matmati’s voice, who speaks to us posthumously, raises a discussion about the manipulated collective history that serves only the oppressors’ agenda.","popularity":0.0921,"poster_path":"/6m0Ya4thDS5s3q7MqjYFSgGjRyJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79189,"logo_path":"/yPWHBZdThBtCyWbe07gKj37g6LL.png","name":"La Luna
