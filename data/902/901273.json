It is obvious that the same song is sung to the little babies in the women's prison in Sliven where the great Bulgarian director Binka Zhelyazkova made two documentaries, the first one named \"Nani-Na\" /\"Lullaby\"/ with the incredible true stories of the prisoners in that facility.  Immediately forbidden, this movie plus the other one - \"Lice i opako\" or \"The Bright and Dark Side of Things\" also made the same year were shown 8 years later when the socialist regime wrongly named as communist one fell apart in 1989. Sadly, Binka Zhelyazkova made no other movie after 1990 until her death in 2011. Deeply insulted by the Bulgarian authorities she decided to decline from cinematographic work, which is something very frustrating indeed, given that all her movies are now evergreen classics.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/pvim4yROU3vkAixSxFJlBLHOm7k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana Film","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Nani-na","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Νανούρισμα","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Binka Zhelyazkova","original_name":"Binka Zhelyazkova","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/aYnFU3fTA9pOfsyQjtzswyJtNm0.jpg","credit_id":"619bae154f9a99002451cce7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Binka Zhelyazkova","original_name":"Binka Zhelyazkova","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/aYnFU3fTA9pOfsyQjtzswyJtNm0.jpg","credit_id":"619bae1be2ff32008ef42a30","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303198,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simeon Pironkov","original_name":"Симеон Пиронков","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619bae25c0ae36002b630ac2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446315,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrej Certov","original_name":"Andrej Certov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619bae2c96033100918f3531","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598015,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lyubcho Stefanov","original_name":"Lyubcho Stefanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619bae3451e6ab008c382395","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0177036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pvim4yROU3vkAixSxFJlBLHOm7k.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1agY9OKjWfuXpYyp07YYHz9mLT2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bg","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
