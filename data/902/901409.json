But rather than seeking to define socialism, director Marc Karlin instead created a series of portraits of people whose lives had intersected with the concept in practical (rather than abstract) terms - it is part of how they define themselves - and asked what 'socialism' meant to them and whether they believed it to be on its way out.","popularity":0.0724,"poster_path":"/jBuVsvYLdI0qZB7g9RW2B9cXuia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utopias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Karlin","original_name":"Marc Karlin","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619c118570b44400424bcb41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":762,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lifA4q4ibFY0NbkXHP2DAv6RfWZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.761,"height":2183,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jBuVsvYLdI0qZB7g9RW2B9cXuia.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1661}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
