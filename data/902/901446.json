The widow has a brother who is in secret a rascal and a member of a gang of bandits. The sheriff and the widow have arrived at an understanding and she is wearing his ring. One day four masked men ride into the village, loot the bank, terrorize the community and ride away with a big sack of gold. The sheriff goes in pursuit, and after a lot of shooting, fast riding and acrobatic horsemanship, the bank looters are caught. When the masks are removed, the sheriff discovers to his consternation that the brother of the handsome widow is the chief of the band. Duty stares at him with unsmiling face.","popularity":0.1943,"poster_path":"/vZPg9pLI165XBYh4kbZnUzLP221.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why the Sheriff Is a Bachelor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mix","original_name":"Tom Mix","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/qTaMWapR1sxjk6mdi3tvRsSMNks.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Sheriff","credit_id":"619c336f63536a002a81b52d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1373982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goldie Colwell","original_name":"Goldie Colwell","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/80eCnqeXg0eaquWMZwdKrumM6G3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"619c337d528b2e002b5284e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo D.
