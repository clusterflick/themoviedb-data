He sees Vicky, the sheriff's daughter, playing a part for a motion picture company. The action calls for Vicky to be overcome by the villain and thrown on a horse. Tom, not understanding the action, blazes away at the villain, and the bullet passes through the actor's hat, chasing the horse upon which Vicky is riding. Tom, coming up with Vicky, believes he has saved her. The director and Vicky's father think Tom a great actor. The sheriff, however, discovers that Tom has the reputation of a \"bad\" man, and orders him to stay away.","popularity":0.2025,"poster_path":"/s3xVQoA4GIfzBmeitlY7V14OWkc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shooting Up the Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mix","original_name":"Tom Mix","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/qTaMWapR1sxjk6mdi3tvRsSMNks.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom Travis","credit_id":"619c4d4b4f9a99002453110d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1470714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Forde","original_name":"Victoria Forde","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/eKZ5rsIgqb6xFS0JfIxMFMylDiv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vicky Wilson","credit_id":"619c4d5a498bc200620cae09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1097472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Jordan","original_name":"Sid Jordan","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/kvnhDr72SuFItTvjOrMK5poJiOx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sheriff Wilson","credit_id":"619c4d69bc2cb300642e1d64","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Farrell","original_name":"Howard Farrell","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Murray","credit_id":"619c4d77bc2cb30090d3733d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3320744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Daly","original_name":"Hazel Daly","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/biW8QcmhrAk5NmHHnNqRtpjm1iZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hazel","credit_id":"619c4d82c4f5520093a343fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Ryan","original_name":"Joe Ryan","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bad Man of Hell's Half Acre","credit_id":"619c4d95e2ff32008ef54d2e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mix","original_name":"Tom Mix","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/qTaMWapR1sxjk6mdi3tvRsSMNks.jpg","credit_id":"619c4d379603310062d7f4bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mix","original_name":"Tom Mix","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/qTaMWapR1sxjk6mdi3tvRsSMNks.jpg","credit_id":"619c4d309603310043f8d8c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0007341","wikidata_id":"Q20803060","facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d9rzUjKddOkPykmriqFKNAkCiws.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s3xVQoA4GIfzBmeitlY7V14OWkc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
