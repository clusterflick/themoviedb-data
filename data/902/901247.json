Armed with a litany of books detailing ancient cultures and rituals, she tries desperately to reach out to the other side and speak to her mother. But when she succeeds, she gets more than she bargained for. Waiting alongside her mother is something monstrous, something that Mia recognises instantly. As she tries to survive the night and escape the ritual alive, Mia is forced to confront a variety of evils - ones from both without, and from within.","popularity":0.4442,"poster_path":"/6hI6wpZ5RAYYfQ2nkPnkSOgrSjM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165019,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inner Circle
