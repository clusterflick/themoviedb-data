It centers on a family with ten children who grew up surfing on the beach and captures them and other residents over a two-year period, revealing their personal stories and convictions as they come to terms with their impending eviction. Sombrio presents a portrait of a vital subculture in BCâ€™s history and challenges our notions of what it means to be a self-determined citizen.","popularity":0.2172,"poster_path":"/soatd5sKzzT1c1xFwBSKoymvDY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manly Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sombrio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3321283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Hieb","original_name":"Amber Hieb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"619c9ef5c0ae360044fa782f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3321282,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Hannenson","original_name":"Daniel Hannenson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619c9ee35c071b0065f8ffd6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3321281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Manly","original_name":"Paul Manly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619c9e7ce2ff3200437891b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2014620,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Lang","original_name":"Paul Lang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619c9f054f9a990098d2fe03","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/soatd5sKzzT1c1xFwBSKoymvDY3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
