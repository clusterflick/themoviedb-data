The crew, locked out in a distant village, decide to shoot a film regardless of the conditions. They set out on a quest to find an actress from the locals while the producer reflects on his childhood in the village. The surreal stories of the first sexual experience, the childhood memories, a father beating his son, a dream with a bicycle and mister Bean, a wench excavating the field, a funeral, the bureaucracy of the government, new yearâ€™s eve, and mass prayers to counter the pandemic, compose a poem for a distant village.","popularity":0.1768,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poem for a Distant Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bing Liu","original_name":"Bing Liu","popularity":0.3059,"profile_path":"/aPP16tzaeUQEKYmxwQMqd17gbp6.jpg","credit_id":"619c046d663627008d4892fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
