That is the lesson to be learned from this animated film. It begins with a confrontation between a man who grows flowers and a technologist who operates computers. A flower pops up in the computer room; a computer tape appears in the garden. Each man destroys the \"foreign object.\" When they come face to face they discover that understanding is better than distrust, respect better than hostility.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uTpbV98IwgJDgrtl2hBI5LtXqm1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1972-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Sous l'arc-en-ciel","type":"French"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sidney Goldsmith","original_name":"Sidney Goldsmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619be152af58cb00666ef471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uTpbV98IwgJDgrtl2hBI5LtXqm1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
