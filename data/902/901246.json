Starting with morning activities until the evening, where the situation in each location is very different. The issue of pandemics and the application of health protocols is the most common problem in each location, as well as in other parts of the world. The existence of the Corona virus that is not visible in front of the eyes makes some residents see it as not a dangerous threat. This film records fragments of events from various perspectives of residents with their respective activities. The story of each location is combined into visual poems, which can be related or unrelated. The most important thing about this film's story is how culturally people face a pandemic which is recorded with the simplest cameras.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6UZE2JDIV5zsR1uoXTrs1eJECnV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No News for Today","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6UZE2JDIV5zsR1uoXTrs1eJECnV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARKIPEL International Documentary and Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2021-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
