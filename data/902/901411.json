Upon regaining consciousness, Padgett’s sight was forever altered by a condition called acquired savant syndrome.

This is a fascinating story into the hidden power of the mind and one man’s inspiring tale of courage and personal triumph.","popularity":0.5042,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Acquired Savant","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382909,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Petersen","original_name":"Thomas Petersen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619c130751e6ab008c38cf7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6257,"name":"genius"},{"id":2754,"name":"trauma"},{"id":228041,"name":"prodigy"},{"id":230113,"name":"math genius"},{"id":311519,"name":"savant"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Meet the Accidental Genius","key":"7H6doOmS-eM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-12-14T07:00:00.000Z","id":"619c137fbc2cb3002cbe25d0"}]}}}
