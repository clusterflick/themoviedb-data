Since fleeing the country in the 90s to seek refuge in Germany, Pepe has lived alone and only communicated with his son by mail and telephone. With his health rapidly declining, Pepe dreams of seeing Bambam one last time before he dies. Remnants of a Revolution is a chronicle of a father and son's journey to confront and come to terms with a violent past. The film reflects on human nature â€“ what made him embrace an ideology and how this ideology took over his soul. Finally, Remnants of a Revolution asks: can one venture this far into the heart of darkness beyond redemption?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dpsDseqdgCUAu8zYX2gqpZQLu2m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remnants of a Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2772363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cha Escala","original_name":"Cha Escala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ba50a71458f00618f2276","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dpsDseqdgCUAu8zYX2gqpZQLu2m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
