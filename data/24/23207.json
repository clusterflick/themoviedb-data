He became a star of the North Korean propaganda machine, but then disappeared from the face of the earth. Now, after 45 years, the story of James Dresnok, the last American defector in North Korea, is being told for the first time. Crossing the Line follows Dresnok as he recalls his childhood, desertion, and life in the DPRK.","popularity":0.7282,"poster_path":"/57vT7GFmBLh8nHyUYZjnS2Jpkac.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dongoong Arts Center","origin_country":""},{"id":4201,"logo_path":"/kqVPAJXp9rslVLAhezDgjuQ6TDw.png","name":"VeryMuchSo Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossing the Line","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":89890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Dresnok","original_name":"James Dresnok","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4462c3a368484e020043","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Robert Jenkins","original_name":"Charles Robert Jenkins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4462c3a368484e020047","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Slater","original_name":"Christian Slater","popularity":2.4799,"profile_path":"/6ww3uweEEXMlvtNjTlgBHxLErPF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4462c3a368484e02004b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4206781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Cumings","original_name":"Bruce Cumings","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d42961bf31f201cd4d8961","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1534186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Il-sung","original_name":"Kim Il-sung","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/3ts5uFsAODlL8XdBAEkrVDAZFni.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64d4296db6c2641154f75733","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Gordon","original_name":"Daniel Gordon","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/1X2lHQOIFnKMlxVL7JrB9WO13HN.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4462c3a368484e02003f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2078629,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nick Bennett","original_name":"Nick Bennett","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d4297edd926a01eb19093a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273063,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heather Fenoughty","original_name":"Heather Fenoughty","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d42984f14dad00c6f6acb4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3515717,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Haddon","original_name":"Peter Haddon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d4298cf14dad00c6f6accd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0473181","wikidata_id":"Q3003801","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":759,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/57vT7GFmBLh8nHyUYZjnS2Jpkac.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":861,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/dGQ7qz0E5Dg4MRLRfTM0q2YnAc0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":244029,"name":"dmz"},{"id":261734,"name":"north korea"},{"id":270373,"name":"pyongyang, north korea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crossing the Line - Deserting to North Korea (Trailer)","key":"Pdpvd2eqfYc","published_at":"2009-12-26T02:19:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec684c3a36854480034d8"}]}}}
