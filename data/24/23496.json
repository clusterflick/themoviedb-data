Although a mockumentary, it is roughly based on Yankovic's real life, beginning with his childhood years, his high school and college days, and up through his early-career rise to stardom. This semi-concocted chronicle also contains classic moments from AL-TV, footage from his trip to Japan, and a somewhat embellished version of how he received permission from Michael Jackson for \"Eat It\". And to top it off, The Compleat Al contains eight \"Weird Al\" music video classics: \"Ricky\", \"I Love Rocky Road\", the award-winning \"Eat It\", \"I Lost on Jeopardy\", \"This Is the Life\", \"Like a Surgeon\", \"One More Minute\", and \"Dare to Be
