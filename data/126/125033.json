The film depicts the challenges of following an unconventional career path. Forget about parents, family, or friends who may not understand or support your choices - there's almost an invisible societal pressure in terms of what types of jobs are acceptable. \"The Magic Life\" is about those who are willing to risk everything to take the road not normally taken. Sometimes the risk pays off, sometimes it doesn't.","popularity":0.0944,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Noah Falk","original_name":"Matthew Noah Falk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163bf3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Howard","original_name":"Michael Howard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163bf7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Cheng","original_name":"Nelson Cheng","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163bef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2126379","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
