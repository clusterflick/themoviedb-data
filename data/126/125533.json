Accustomed to a certain degree of empowerment and independence from her husband (deciding to stay in her own house instead of moving into his household), Mimi carries on a not-too-subtle affair with the married Abba, a fishmonger who sends her a tell-tale case of fish after each encounter as a token of his affection. Confronted by Issa with his suspicions of infidelity after he finds Abba in the courtyard, Mimi decides to file for divorce, a move that soon brings on a new set of complications, as relatives plead for reconciliation to avoid the shame, Issa's second wife increasingly resents the attention paid to Mimi, and Abba's wife begins to grow suspicious of Mimi's role in her husband's life.","popularity":0.0745,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Cissé","origin_country":"ML"},{"id":22029,"logo_path":"/asH5UhhC8dRUUExZKIis0Y3dyjy.png","name":"Canal+ Horizons","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7473,"logo_path":"/hx4vqFSqUqJTPvTSuu0uhvjApyn.png","name":"Festival de Cannes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ML","name":"Mali"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Me Who You Are","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sokona Gakou","original_name":"Sokona Gakou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mimi","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166bf3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1007031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Assane Kouyaté","original_name":"Assane Kouyaté","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Issa","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166bf7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Badra Alou Sissoko","original_name":"Badra Alou Sissoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Abba","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166bfb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Souleymane Cissé","original_name":"Souleymane Cissé","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/3I5mPRK20GW1Qp54BmyOmWX0xAK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166be9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Souleymane Cissé","original_name":"Souleymane Cissé","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/3I5mPRK20GW1Qp54BmyOmWX0xAK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166bef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1426377","wikidata_id":"Q7697481","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
