Cities are scoured for features. Sleep is lost. Hits are taken. All for the opportunity to present oneâ€™s own interpretation of the sport. Join the crew throughout all times of the day and night as they put in the fullest efforts to portray their perspectives on the current progression in skiing; providing insight on a side of the sport that often times falls short of the spotlight. This is a skiing film that has been created to paint a picture on the lifestyles of a group of friends who share a similar outlook on the sport.","popularity":0.1982,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12896,"logo_path":null,"name":"4bi9","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Begging for Change","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Napier","original_name":"Andrew Napier","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":"/w6A7a994SG2Xqae2Em475UpicsG.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a368484e1690d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"AJ Dakoulas","original_name":"AJ Dakoulas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a368484e1690e5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Napier","original_name":"Andrew Napier","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":"/w6A7a994SG2Xqae2Em475UpicsG.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a368484e1690eb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"AJ Dakoulas","original_name":"AJ Dakoulas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a368484e1690d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":948533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Braunstein","original_name":"Paul Braunstein","popularity":0.6404,"profile_path":"/5WFAZe2AGttbi0LPg2MmmswL7Gn.jpg","credit_id":"5563777bc3a36853b7002f4f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
