An eye-opening experience. In the wake of the 1999 elections, four filmmakers decided to go out with cameras in hand and gauge the mood of their countrymen, who had made Jörg Haider's FPO party the second most powerful in Austria. What they found was a country apparently \"like any other\" , filled with nice ordinary people. Who feel perfectly comfortable dreaming of a possible future without foreigners, or speaking with equanimity about the old days of the Third Reich.","popularity":0.2765,"poster_path":"/mMZmT6JlqsSDCSLBCAaZZydCacS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37058,"logo_path":"/pWUIywEOdy0650kBbuRw5aI90zA.png","name":"Lotus-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2002-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State of the Nation","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Glawogger","original_name":"Michael Glawogger","popularity":0.1348,"profile_path":"/bYkuAISIwtWAbOuFA8wnKiHhscE.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad4c3a368484e169375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrich Seidl","original_name":"Ulrich Seidl","popularity":0.3538,"profile_path":"/jvZeADVhGC5PytZlRmWqfEtls8f.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad4c3a368484e16937b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Sturminger","original_name":"Michael Sturminger","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/jncXp0viomDtAYcuycEKr8gbZwK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad4c3a368484e169381","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Albert","original_name":"Barbara Albert","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/8UoUIc290lqP3LvR7b7guAht3nF.jpg","credit_id":"56ff9fb09251416787001c77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0332835","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mMZmT6JlqsSDCSLBCAaZZydCacS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1628,"name":"nationalism"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":1201,"name":"austria"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
