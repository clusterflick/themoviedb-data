The cast is as follows: An astrophysician who works alone with Geraldine in an observatory high in the mountains. He’d like to seduce Geraldine, but she seems to prefer the shepherd who’s been relegated to a shabby hut nearby. A group of filmmakers stuck in the middle of the countryside after their crew went on strike because lunch never turned up. A squadron of stupid soldiers who consider even the most minor incident to be proof of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of France. A maniacal geologist, oblivious of everything, who continues to search for the traces of a tectonic Big Bang in the most inaccessible places.","popularity":0.5098,"poster_path":"/n91EFb7BgF95UwJxRg8sirH3Wvf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wrecked on Road 17","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shipwrecked on Route D 17","type":"IMDb"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Amalric","original_name":"Mathieu Amalric","popularity":0.7277,"profile_path":"/fMhfoTbjlXQy2Iojp7oYx49hLQl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"René","credit_id":"52fe4ad5c3a368484e1694bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Bouchitey","original_name":"Patrick Bouchitey","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/x0isqvzrLzHnW9bAR2jMxaq1SVW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"5ddc894e0cd44600142cf738","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iliana Lolic","original_name":"Iliana Lolic","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/xIfYNic5obMjqSUGGVMW2OqPZiu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"614adea2daf57c002c99e675","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Haudepin","original_name":"Sabine Haudepin","popularity":0.1443,"profile_path":"/gUwhkTqvxWvmmQaqwCpQoNZ59qR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Géraldine","credit_id":"614adeddc2823a006440b179","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Christophe Bouvet","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Bouvet","popularity":0.3677,"profile_path":"/w57t3esYfYjb3LhYsWP8K0pPUZo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Le sergent-chef","credit_id":"614adf35daf57c00436ebe4a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Dubouche","original_name":"Gérard Dubouche","popularity":0.2778,"profile_path":"/ffYqjv4L1IwOGW2Tm5wnduKUZSS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Le berger","credit_id":"614adf8922df2e002c9ac48e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":58788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Briand","original_name":"Lionel Briand","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Le Radio","credit_id":"614adfb8d2c0c10028ec7744","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Moullet","original_name":"Luc Moullet","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/zzZ3ACtgddW0r14ftmydsFq9VE7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad5c3a368484e1694b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Moullet","original_name":"Luc Moullet","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/zzZ3ACtgddW0r14ftmydsFq9VE7.jpg","credit_id":"5ddc8936aad9c20012c3718a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5268,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paulo Branco","original_name":"Paulo Branco","popularity":0.1345,"profile_path":"/fts6IfqRE5xZuZB3iN6yeKNzfhd.jpg","credit_id":"5ddc8926aad9c20012c3716c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0296775","wikidata_id":"Q3234155","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/n91EFb7BgF95UwJxRg8sirH3Wvf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
