His ocean-deep baritone voice is not dissimilar to that of the great Joe Williams, but he uses it sparingly, delivering just a few choruses before starting to dance in a manner that recalls Nelson Mandela's trademark two-step. He then eases his 67-year-old frame into a hearty slow-mo twist. This is possibly not what was expected of an artist commonly perceived as an avant-garde firestarter in the mould of Albert Ayler, and a committed disciple of the final phase of John Coltrane's career in the mid-60s.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pharoah Sanders Live at Jazz Cafe London","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pharoah Sanders","original_name":"Pharoah Sanders","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"632ee563fcec2e007cb68ad4","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
