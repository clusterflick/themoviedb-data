During the making of this film, filmmakers uncovered new evidence of White's innocence and brought the case back to Federal Court. Holy Man offers a rare glimpse into the mysterious world of Lakota religion, their intimate connection to the land, and a provocative expose of the systemic injustice that Native Americans face in the criminal justice system.","popularity":0.554,"poster_path":"/kGWuWC78GCFM9mKzweDg0MiouQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to the reservation.","title":"Holy Man: The USA vs. Douglas White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheen","original_name":"Martin Sheen","popularity":1.2177,"profile_path":"/m2Y3Q0uyuW6htrn2W9UWCWMkpZu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163b37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Means","original_name":"Russell Means","popularity":0.4157,"profile_path":"/5qBgrr6eror0bEene4LthnjUFnT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163b3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Floyd \"Red Crow\" Westerman","original_name":"Floyd \"Red Crow\" Westerman","popularity":0.1629,"profile_path":"/pJFB7xCPy2PntmPKBg5d3UDVXAA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163b3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Alan Wolf","original_name":"Fred Alan Wolf","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163b43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Ellison","original_name":"Bruce Ellison","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"611c850dd363e5005cd909c2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Jessum","original_name":"Jennifer Jessum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163b2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080865,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Joseph","original_name":"Simon Joseph","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abac3a368484e163b33","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2035517","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kGWuWC78GCFM9mKzweDg0MiouQj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
