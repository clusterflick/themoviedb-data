Unlike his married brother who is expecting a baby, Derek is single and without a career. Although he aspires to become a graphic-animator, he works part-time at his uncle’s construction company. Late at night he wanders the street alone and frequents nightclubs in search of companionship. Derek suddenly finds himself in an intimate relationship with a woman he meets, Nicole. When a neighbourhood raccoon becomes a constant nuisance by tearing up his family’s garbage, Derek sets out to catch it.","popularity":0.4189,"poster_path":"/tkU3LQ1PkWSCpFBumLrsEOVKkJY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70684,"logo_path":"/5NRl4cajjnw3cL58APB0zHZaAJS.png","name":"Medium Density Fibreboard Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tower","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Bogart","original_name":"Derek Bogart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Derek","credit_id":"52fe4acdc3a368484e167c11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Fairbairn","original_name":"Nicole Fairbairn","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/8qrEUmWxbQ5c9xatj03u5SA2v6i.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nicole","credit_id":"52fe4acdc3a368484e167c15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Sawyer","original_name":"Deborah Sawyer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"52fe4acdc3a368484e167c19","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Montgomery","original_name":"Daniel Montgomery","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/f4WVcZzGkJG3la3F5ES23qJjFXK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4acdc3a368484e167c25","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazik Radwanski","original_name":"Kazik Radwanski","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/wjubnnmUWZKoVmiY1PlKXxwLzql.jpg","credit_id":"5650261f92514164c00025a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazik Radwanski","original_name":"Kazik Radwanski","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/wjubnnmUWZKoVmiY1PlKXxwLzql.jpg","credit_id":"56502624c3a368071b0069d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2319142","wikidata_id":"Q73898270","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/frdasRtHVJ7LuHs6hsWJtI7J5PO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/grRTlwi5nSyjkTDZISjN7QDV9wD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y7ld9hhIZyFwa1jNRhSZhDXXT9w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":999,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tkU3LQ1PkWSCpFBumLrsEOVKkJY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4227,"name":"toronto, canada"},{"id":7949,"name":"racoon"},{"id":171556,"name":"social outcast"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TOWER Trailer | Festival 2012","key":"MHBIG0JfECM","published_at":"2012-08-09T16:39:11.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec6ecc3a3685448008fa2"}]}}}
