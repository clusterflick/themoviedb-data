Fifty-one women and fifty men fitted the profile. In the course of time a few of these 101 people had died, others had moved to another community or abroad. But in 1995 Kossakovsky managed to capture on film all seventy remaining residents, in the street, at work or simply at home. While doing so he spent time with doctors and patients, entertainers and businessmen, construction workers and homeless people. In his unorthodox style Kossakovsky has produced a beautiful profile of people in their thirties in St. Petersburg.","popularity":0.1015,"poster_path":"/qtOTRY9MxmJ0rMZZOVve0NglZfH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wednesday","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Среда 19.07.1961","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sreda","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wednesday 19.7.1961","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Kossakovsky","original_name":"Viktor Kossakovsky","popularity":0.2324,"profile_path":"/aSRVvSwcyQK1EIffAkRSn0BEitB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4abbc3a368484e16404d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0126724","wikidata_id":"Q30802977","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qtOTRY9MxmJ0rMZZOVve0NglZfH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chicago International Film Festival","release_date":"1997-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
