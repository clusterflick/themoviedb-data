Zhiziluo is a town barely clinging to life. Tucked away in a rugged corner of Yunnan Province, Lisu and Nu minority villagers squat in the abandoned halls of this remote former Community county seat. Divided into three parts, this epic documentary takes an intimate look at its varied cast of characters, bringing audiences face to face with people left behind by China's new economy. A father-son duo of elderly preachers argue over the future of their village church. Two young lovers face a break-up over harsh financial realities. A twelve year-old boy, abandoned by his family, scavenges the hillside to feed himself.","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":"/cDO3ABAH8iAP2dH4P7zCRQVRrg7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2010-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Town","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhao Dayong","original_name":"Zhao Dayong","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/gM5VjEjcza7YUUfQnng20wlKdom.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4abfc3a368484e164d7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1613084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cDO3ABAH8iAP2dH4P7zCRQVRrg7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":519}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Icarus Films / dGenerate Films","release_date":"2010-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
