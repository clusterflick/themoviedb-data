Both are in relationships on rocky ground. As these emotions swirl, Tony meets his US Postal Service letter carrier, a single mom named Kathy who's come to LA from Wyoming with her daughter, a budding actress. Chris meets Anna, an Italian beauty working in the States for a few months wrangling animals on movie sets. Chris also befriends Clive, an aging and crusty man whose longing for his recently-deceased wife is a portrait of true love. Can Clive's example help Chris sort out his love life, and can Tony grow up enough to see the possibilities with Kathy and her daughter?","popularity":0.8763,"poster_path":"/cGCNG3Md9t0Zvhksr27aqXa1AI9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"two brothers, four women and the search for Magnetic Perfection","title":"Smiling Fish & Goat On Fire","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Derick Martini","original_name":"Derick Martini","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Chris Remi","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":181851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Hathaway","original_name":"Amy Hathaway","popularity":0.3878,"profile_path":"/oYSmd7REmzYVRZjU0sICEQrcRfZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alison","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Martini","original_name":"Steven Martini","popularity":0.6278,"profile_path":"/gzQdyHpJpDsoe2w4R90YFnKY4kP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tony Remi","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c1b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1895804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilda Taylor","original_name":"Wilda Taylor","popularity":0.207,"profile_path":"/vwmIvQ6cGWAPRNicZHlgH5ox8T4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ginger Baker","credit_id":"59cbf981c3a3687797017ead","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rena Riffel","original_name":"Rena Riffel","popularity":0.2971,"profile_path":"/qqqKiHKztOWulPnqvbapDRvtMEE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Party Girl #2","credit_id":"605695b1caab6d006b5a0861","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ion Overman","original_name":"Ion Overman","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/5biy566sSd2F7TD1GTZnmcw6IiE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Party Girl #1","credit_id":"605695d9c14fee0029433514","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":212821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christa Miller","original_name":"Christa Miller","popularity":0.7015,"profile_path":"/gfLL2dM209v3WfVrovwGszjgtB3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Kathy","credit_id":"6056962f0792e1006b2f51f0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melba Englander","original_name":"Melba Englander","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Nurse","credit_id":"63a6ae002faf4d007d3908e1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Jordan","original_name":"Kevin Jordan","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010852,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harry Kim","original_name":"Harry Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abd54c99251411e95030839","department":"Production","job":"Unit Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162348","wikidata_id":"Q7544746","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cGCNG3Md9t0Zvhksr27aqXa1AI9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Roger Ebert","key":"0yTRCA27HWg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-04-05T22:50:33.000Z","id":"601292c41b70ae003c5c4094"}]}}}
