The director seems crazy, the art director has idiotic ideas, and the acting coach is eccentric: they even look like brothers, related by their common obsession for the theater, linked as one with the actors. The new project is Mozart's Don Giovanni, in which the director insists to give it a brand new interpretation and an avant-garde treatment. Now, he has to deal with the violent objection from the actors, the musicians, the singing coach, the stage manager, and even the cafe bar attendants and the cleaners. The situation is further complicated as the director is such a womanizer like Don Juan... and his lovers and kids keep bugging him throughout the rehearsal...","popularity":0.3736,"poster_path":"/1mSBTQDfrqWglLJYG5w4QAYZjzY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157,"logo_path":"/s537keIoi6wUOU8E9ztWaV2DY1H.png","name":"SVT Drama","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":251447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crescendo Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1986-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mozart Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Brødrene Mozart","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Etienne Glaser","original_name":"Etienne Glaser","popularity":0.074,"profile_path":"/kgZYuM8HyPWe1ANHeIT2veVZrwy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Walter","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166957","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Zandén","original_name":"Philip Zandén","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":"/uFmKesKHzLmCKAtOS7uCmQK2b2M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Flemming","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e16695b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Bronett","original_name":"Henry Bronett","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Fritz","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e16695f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loa Falkman","original_name":"Loa Falkman","popularity":0.1841,"profile_path":"/nLF1gK1InARA21VE3GWuSRSWJ3B.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eskil / Don Juan","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166963","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agneta Ekmanner","original_name":"Agneta Ekmanner","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":"/wgA9zkSVixZBNWyJwGBAPJazBca.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Marian / Donna Elvira","credit_id":"5d14b43f7648410027d2667f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena T.
