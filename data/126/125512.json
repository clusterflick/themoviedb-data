That evening, he listens to a son playing on his boom box, and it provides him with inspiration: DINOSAURS!  The next day at the museum, Phillip discovers that the search for the truth about these magnificent animals and their astonishing 160-million-year success on the earth is the most fascinating mystery tale he's ever heard.  What follows is an exciting collection of established theories and fascinating speculation.","popularity":0.9479,"poster_path":"/wjJqodWtP48BTlKdAdReGvHMhA0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103143,"logo_path":"/demBWOJhnAE7jj6vfKmM3EOdBWE.png","name":"Western Publishing Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":81653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Will Vinton Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":56645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pyramid Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dinosaurs: A Fun Filled Trip Back in Time","video":true,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dinosaurs!
