He also presents his pet dog to a poor peasant and his wife. For the poor peasant and his wife, the dog is not a mere dog, but a symbol of the royalty which had always inspired in them feelings of respect, admiration and blind worship. They bathe the dog in a very ceremonious manner and take much care of it. They even desist from tying it up. But when the dog bites and kills a duck and then a boy, it leads to problems. The democratic leader orders the arrest of the dog, followed by the arrest of the poor peasant. Then follow protests, talks, negotiations leading to more interesting developments.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dog's Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murali Nair","original_name":"Murali Nair","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4acec3a368484e168273","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0286887","wikidata_id":"Q7148606","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
