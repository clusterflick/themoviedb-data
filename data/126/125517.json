She's a meter maid in Tours, working in the rain, subject to verbal abuse from those she cites. Her husband Patrick is consumed by the work of finishing their new house: carpet, tile, faucets. He's also a hothead, subjecting Sonange to tantrums. While she's often quiet and withdrawn, she longs to be a singer. When by chance she meets Mylène, an accomplished, beautiful Parisian writer she admires, Solange gives her a demo tape. Mylène is encouraging, a friendship of sorts develops, and when Solange despairs after a series of personal, emotional setbacks, she heads for Mylène's doorstep in Paris. Does a singing career await, and what about Patrick?","popularity":0.4782,"poster_path":"/uGZpUA4G4RqGCjv3BNFVpRpzUot.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":313,"logo_path":"/rx5CT9wUnEz0AcdpcX9epujv7nw.png","name":"TS Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Bleu des villes","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florence Vignon","original_name":"Florence Vignon","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/uSjOZ4nUgSWPH1cSBgZcuGtd8Wi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Solange","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166b03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathilde Seigner","original_name":"Mathilde Seigner","popularity":0.4655,"profile_path":"/AiuFNfBOyWWuOygzgu6bNgXyoXU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mylène","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166b07","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Chappey","original_name":"Antoine Chappey","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/lzd6hhB4X0kgSJ2houM1DXM1dtg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Patrick Rouault","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166b0b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Duquesne","original_name":"Philippe Duquesne","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/xbfJaGOn5k5tAJY5jUFnXjpopPy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jean-Paul","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166b0f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Brizé","original_name":"Stéphane Brizé","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/epoJIIxY0VKETxLkpvcHA2kTVku.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166aff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Brizé","original_name":"Stéphane Brizé","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/epoJIIxY0VKETxLkpvcHA2kTVku.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166b15","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florence Vignon","original_name":"Florence Vignon","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/uSjOZ4nUgSWPH1cSBgZcuGtd8Wi.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac8c3a368484e166b1b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3935993,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Pierre Maricourt","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Maricourt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657bc086ea394900e1e89d7b","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0201483","wikidata_id":"Q19817067","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7JBoB9f4ZpavczjdenLrjZ6dw6D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/XqNYKwqAx81o8avdeWe0ko4Kgg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uGZpUA4G4RqGCjv3BNFVpRpzUot.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dyOj81T55Lkxxk3MzIUJctozQkW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":763},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ywergDedFGZlxfOyRlaNk2p2OFo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
