Pursued by a U.S. Marshall from Utah who specializes in clown cases, they become dangerously entangled with a swindling cult leader whose truck (full of scammed cash) they have stolen to pull their trailer. It's a crazed festival of guns, puppets, blood, rubber noses and dark humor.  (By the way, none of this is nearly as interesting as it sounds.)","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/yO8OmeSxIYwkVzDnAXzeb576kB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's blood, drugs, bullets & greasepaint","title":"Killer Klowns from Kansas on Krack","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Harris","original_name":"Jack Harris","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"631632800c1255007b9003f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hawkins","original_name":"David Hawkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"631632b020e6a5007a5d6534","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Henson","original_name":"Will Henson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"631632bd326c19007f2d1cd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Hicks","original_name":"Kenny Hicks","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"631632c6028420007b3a93f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Mercy","original_name":"Peter Mercy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"631632cd5f2b8d00928144d2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles E.
