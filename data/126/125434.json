A talented, but as yet unrecognised artist, he is forced to scratch a living growing corn and breeding canaries until the Public Health Authorities step in. Out of this develops a humorous and quizzical love story. Francisco searches for a new home for his old and alcoholic dog, having decided that he himself is worth more dead than alive. But just as his old dog finds that it is never too late to learn new tricks so Francisco rediscovers love and a zest for living in the beauty and serenity of Consuela.","popularity":0.2105,"poster_path":"/88aOoSjCSy0J2Xh45lEuuao3wt5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A down-on-his-luck painter, grievous over his wife's death, commits to improving his life and finding new love.","title":"Only Once in a Lifetime","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Brook","original_name":"Claudio Brook","popularity":0.5229,"profile_path":"/k0WhSM75jPNlflgvAd928npRfAi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jimenez","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a368484e16638f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheree North","original_name":"Sheree North","popularity":0.5017,"profile_path":"/4chyz0AqVrjd7D6AWIJ4JrX4wyh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a368484e166393","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Grattan","original_name":"Alejandro Grattan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a368484e16638b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0079669","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/88aOoSjCSy0J2Xh45lEuuao3wt5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
