There, he became one of the first refugees in Eckernförde – there were six of them at the time, he later remembers. Quickly learning German, he got politically involved in refugee projects, and spoke publicly about his experiences. A move to Jena for university followed: a new everyday life with exam stress, living in a shared flat, a relationship. It was during his studies that he finally felt that he was no longer being reduced to his experience as a refugee: he belonged. Alayham found his feet, as much as possible in a foreign country. But when is “arriving” truly over? Over a period of ten years, documentary filmmaker Fredo Wulf accompanied Alayham on his journey from Schleswig-Holstein via Jena to Heidelberg, where he has lived since getting his medical license.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arrival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5797930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alayham Mahfoud","original_name":"Alayham Mahfoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690b4b484fa3be9821d731fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5797931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nabbil Mahfoud","original_name":"Nabbil Mahfoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690b4b4e60ae036fcab694cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5797932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amal Mahfoud","original_name":"Amal Mahfoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690b4b555d8e309f27613adf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5797934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Obey Mahfoud","original_name":"Obey Mahfoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690b4b5ba5aa36b59fd7317e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5797935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Enders","original_name":"Liz Enders","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690b4b7759189cc465d73211","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3866812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fredo Wulf","original_name":"Fredo Wulf","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b4b408b604bf4904bd017","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDt1vUJwBuFDre7q46z0MDGTGUb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nordic Film Days Lübeck","release_date":"2025-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
