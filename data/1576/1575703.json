Although she took heart medicine every day, she continued to participate in various gatherings and activities. However, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, she gave up all outdoor activities, spending most of her time in or around the home. Since then, she has unfurled conversations with plants on the balcony, plants in the kitchen, and those rooted in the vegetable garden too. ‘Get Some Sunshine’ explores a day in the life of this lady (the film director’s mother) and the solidarity she developed with companion plants during the pandemic.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Get Some Sunshine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
