After sifting through hundreds of thousands of computer files made accessible via open access archives, Semiconductor have brought together some of the sun's finest unseen moments. These images have been kept in their most raw form, revealing the energetic particles and solar wind as a rain of white noise. This black and white grainy quality is routinely cleaned up by NASA, usually hiding the processes and mechanics in action behind the capturing procedure. Most of the imagery has been collected by satellites orbiting the Earth as single frames, or files of information, that are then reorganised into spectral sequences. The soundtrack brings to light the hidden forces at play upon the solar surface, by directly translating the intensity of the brightness into audio manipulation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ueQwQnrYxBdLS5Vp2eV0rFWDRFS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brilliant Noise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Jarman","original_name":"Ruth Jarman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b2b04e67198cad3934b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5797770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Gerhardt","original_name":"Joe Gerhardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b2b13e1eab1fb154bd051","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Semiconductor","original_name":"Semiconductor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b2b3eca851c132ee184d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ueQwQnrYxBdLS5Vp2eV0rFWDRFS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
