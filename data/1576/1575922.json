Married off in her adolescence, she escapes her home seeking freedom, only to face new trauma when she is sexually assaulted by someone she trusts. Through Henna’s journey of pain, courage, and eventual self-discovery, the film sheds light on the urgent need to protect vulnerable girls and end cycles of violence and neglect. Ultimately, Henna is a story of resilience and hope—affirming that one’s past does not define one’s future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hausa","iso_639_1":"ha","name":"Hausa"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5613557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ijapari Ben-Hirki","original_name":"Ijapari Ben-Hirki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"690cfbcb49a2d5cbc8ce784f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5800809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hauwa Ghan","original_name":"Hauwa Ghan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"690cfbf2f38cbda45dc04ce8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4520194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Muhammed","original_name":"Sophia Muhammed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690d5f7f81395a6dd1d249f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3640395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimbo Atiya","original_name":"Dimbo Atiya","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690d5f92ae981ceb3f9ab109","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
