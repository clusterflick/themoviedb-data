What comes around goes around is an expanded cinema performance with 16mm projectors building up a kinetic panorama. It is a kind attempt of resistance in a world where technology, speed, youth and the triumph over nature are admired, and everything else is regarded as unwanted, slow, obsolete and backwards. An attempt in our fast paced world with smart, clean and super fast technology, to grasp the notion of time and duration which is incomplete and continuously growing, stating no beginning nor ending in a kinetic panorama.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Goes Around Comes Around","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5797651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Britt Al-Busultan","original_name":"Britt Al-Busultan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b1097d41017421578a253","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Turku Animated Film Festival","release_date":"2025-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
