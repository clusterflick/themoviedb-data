This sensitive portrait of three women whose lives have been marked by sudden separation is carried from the outset by a meditative soundtrack that shapes an environment in which personal experience becomes expressible. Ritual gestures – traditional costumes, cooking together, hugging – create a protective shell that allows pain not only to be expressed and shared, but also transformed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amnion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3771122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Lomenová","original_name":"Sarah Lomenová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b524a0ae91bba28d7319a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2647716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wanda Kaprálová","original_name":"Wanda Kaprálová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b525e8cfd8b2510d73241","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034562,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kryštof Čížek","original_name":"Kryštof Čížek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b526f350cb13a02934ba3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3043410,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alan Sýs","original_name":"Alan Sýs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b527914982184b378a2d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2313620,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Šimon Herrmann","original_name":"Šimon Herrmann","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b528453461e0153f6cf85","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":40895,"name":"illness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
