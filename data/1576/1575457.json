Obsolete 8-bit warriors, polygonal relics, and motion-captured ghosts clash across surreal landscapes that merge the logic of digital combat with the haunting depth of 16th-century Flemish painting. Each battle unfolds within hybrid architectures—half cathedral, half code—where pixels and brushstrokes coexist in luminous chaos. The film charts the evolution of game aesthetics, from pixelated minimalism to photorealistic excess, transforming visual history into a battlefield of memory and computation. Both elegy and spectacle, The Hypergaussian War reflects on obsolescence, artificial intelligence, and the endless recursion of images seeking meaning in their own destruction.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/kuua69aPDsvXIGGf89yxEMSzUQk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2025-04-05","revenue":50000,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"obsolete avatars, between pixels and paint, When code dreams of flesh, the battlefield never ends, the ghosts of the digital age collide, he machine keeps playing.","title":"The Hypergaussian War","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcello Mercado","original_name":"Marcello Mercado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4TWVzcdxgN1pwVMwokn7YEfUIQe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Avatar","credit_id":"690be024c4b5576044d73685","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcello Mercado","original_name":"Marcello Mercado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4TWVzcdxgN1pwVMwokn7YEfUIQe.jpg","credit_id":"690bcdd43d9169e4c2f6d2ec","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcello Mercado","original_name":"Marcello Mercado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4TWVzcdxgN1pwVMwokn7YEfUIQe.jpg","credit_id":"690bde88a5aa36b59fd73527","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcello Mercado","original_name":"Marcello Mercado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4TWVzcdxgN1pwVMwokn7YEfUIQe.jpg","credit_id":"690bdfc1ea40a1d55078a6a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/54PIl8jZOhN8cGNHApDzB9enIQO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kuua69aPDsvXIGGf89yxEMSzUQk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":310,"name":"artificial intelligence (a.i.)"},{"id":8469,"name":"computer simulation"},{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"},{"id":293118,"name":"experimental music"},{"id":295328,"name":"video game history"},{"id":330486,"name":"avatar"},{"id":345118,"name":"videogames"},{"id":350059,"name":"speculative fiction"},{"id":361605,"name":"obsolete video games"},{"id":361606,"name":"flamish painting"},{"id":361607,"name":"hypergaussian functions"},{"id":361608,"name":"ai-powered film"},{"id":361609,"name":"posthuman aesthetics"},{"id":361610,"name":"obsolete technology"},{"id":361611,"name":"flemish painting"},{"id":361612,"name":"8-bit aesthetics"},{"id":361613,"name":"low-resolution graphics"},{"id":361614,"name":"procedural animation"},{"id":361615,"name":"data aesthetics"},{"id":361635,"name":"synthetic landscapes"},{"id":361636,"name":"techno-baroque"},{"id":361637,"name":"digital mythology"},{"id":361638,"name":"post-internet art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ATP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gaussian War by Marcello Mercado (Sound version)","key":"1066602876","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-17T14:45:49.000Z","id":"690bd5d3b19e148b8bd733cc"}]}}}
