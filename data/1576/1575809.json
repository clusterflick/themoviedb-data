It is a film about the joys of life and survival strategies on the forgotten stage of Macedonia. This is the story of a 17-year-old accordionist, who is searching for her place in the world. Corridors are her practice rooms – at home and at school. The whole year she practices diligently and passionately on her old Supita accordion. Obviously, she wasn’t given the name Emilija, meaning „the keen one“, for nothing.  She wants to become a professional accordionist, but for this she needs a new accordion. Something that is unattainable for her poor family. But the family‘s poverty also releases their creativity and Imagination. Her father, an art teacher, begins to work as a bodyguard, while Emilija‘s mother illegally sells sweets in the family garden. This is a film about becoming an adult in one of Europe‘s more desolate corners.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":8197,"logo_path":"/614xBoHyCqgiCK8qbGZXreholvh.png","name":"Beetz Brothers Film Production","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2007-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Macedonian Dream - A Girl and Her Accordion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","title":"Makedonski san: djevojčica i njezina harmonika","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Девојчето со хармоника","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Akkordeonspielerin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5800466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilija Obradova","original_name":"Emilija Obradova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"690cc8c2330874f5de4bd79f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617793,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Biljana Garvanlieva","original_name":"Biljana Garvanlieva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690cc417e2dacbf49af6d4f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617793,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Biljana Garvanlieva","original_name":"Biljana Garvanlieva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690cc436e2dacbf49af6d4f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914440,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"André Nier","original_name":"André Nier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690cc45f45ea53f0854bd6d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1490854,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manuel Zimmer","original_name":"Manuel Zimmer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690cc473710fc42b6bf6d67c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328871,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Beetz","original_name":"Christian Beetz","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690cc487520e490e18e18d10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1830426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Susanne Schüle","original_name":"Susanne Schüle","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690cc49dbeccc3639bb6940e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15052786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zagreb Dox","release_date":"2007-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Die Akkordeonspielerin","key":"mF8IllX4ZiM","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2008-07-03T18:52:38.000Z","id":"690cc956574761b999935295"}]}}}
