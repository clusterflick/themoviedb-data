The focus is on the political struggle against neoliberal austerity policies, which have their origins in the hated Thatcher government.  The film features the former socialist MP Dave Nellist, who is now the national chair of the Trade Unionist & Socialist Coalition and Hannah Sell, the general secretary of the Socialist Party. The film features a local election campaign in the miners' town of Nuneaton, students campaigning against an increase in tuition fees and refuse workers from Birmingham striking against massive cuts to their wages.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/b8hHk6lc44SqUnZdi14HThca56x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Don't Let The Bastards Grind You Down","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Nellist","original_name":"Dave Nellist","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"690b63bf4bbddefda5613bfa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve Miller","original_name":"Eve Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"690b63cb2084c80d71613b29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Hammond","original_name":"Frankie Hammond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"690b63d489c74ea6f24bd16a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Ponting","original_name":"Hannah Ponting","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"690b63dc7abb084efb78a45b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Sell","original_name":"Hannah Sell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"690b63e34dc759cbf0f6cfbc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Briggs","original_name":"Jimmy Briggs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"690b63ec11050eb3dcb69588","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max McGee","original_name":"Max McGee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"690b63f8dd96e460ebd731c4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Hart","original_name":"Nick Hart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"690b64071e28d988bc935048","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Onay Kasab","original_name":"Onay Kasab","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"690b6416f942afb935e186e6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steeven Biset","original_name":"Steeven Biset","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"690b64219b95f0f2c8d733b8","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Farwig","original_name":"Christoph Farwig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b6435e1eab1fb154bd15e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Farwig","original_name":"Christoph Farwig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b64431804093465613aeb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798083,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luise Artmann","original_name":"Luise Artmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b6456edbdaa9afab69475","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5798084,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Porterbrown","original_name":"Tom Porterbrown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690b646fcf57854f8a613b16","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xMFVda2iZwyAbdbZjQSvUbyoaQN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2480,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b8hHk6lc44SqUnZdi14HThca56x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1748}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4112,"name":"strike"},{"id":1773,"name":"socialism"},{"id":6346,"name":"trade union"},{"id":33847,"name":"british politics"},{"id":296770,"name":"labour"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
