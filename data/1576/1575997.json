He accepts an invitation to stay in the home of his rather colorless brother, Andrew, and is soon not only making love to Martha, the Belgian maid, but is also finding Andrew's wife, Hester, receptive to his flirting. After stealing money entrusted to Andrew by his church, Oswald is on his way out of town when he passes a school fire, rescues several children, and is himself seriously burned. Andrew offers his own skin for grafting, and Oswald directs Hester to return the money.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5xU665jQCD8V0vhSK5qjdVTCD52.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14950,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.P.
