Combining archive and contemporary footage - including that of the royal visit to Canada and the US in 1976, the bicentenary year of American independence - the film explores the monarchy through a quarter-century which saw the conquest of Everest, the development of television as a mass medium, the first supersonic flight and space exploration.  Through good times and bad, and tumultuous changes for better or for worse, one factor remained constant: the monarchy, in the person of Queen Elizabeth II, provided a continuity and stability which this film celebrates in her Silver Jubilee year.","popularity":0.7131,"poster_path":"/9P9yZgDKFm6SD9bqCyaZBu1V5Ca.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":538,"logo_path":"/oGpxL5lFf8VpWsAQ6tut0on25LW.png","name":"EMI Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1977-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"25 Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63570725c9dbf9007a005510","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","original_name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/uPfQY4f2uJP6TJVg7BdLzp0lzce.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6357073656b9f7007b14d56c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Charles III of the United Kingdom","original_name":"King Charles III of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/9WlQBs2v4QTbA1SOrlyyPG4MdN9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63570746a9117f007a06aadb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382057,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Coggans","original_name":"Tony Coggans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545a5930c3a36826000003fd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":573592,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Delaney","original_name":"Mike Delaney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545a59570e0a263f470003fe","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Morley","original_name":"Peter Morley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545a5918c3a36825f5000408","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Van Haren Noman","original_name":"Eric Van Haren Noman","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545a5943c3a36826090003d6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382059,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jeff Harvey","original_name":"Jeff Harvey","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545a59a5c3a36825f500041a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Morley","original_name":"Peter Morley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545a5909c3a36826090003cd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40747,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harvey Harrison","original_name":"Harvey Harrison","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545a59980e0a263f590003f5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1344023","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4QjbrKMIXUT3Gxe8PIATATbtyxc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9P9yZgDKFm6SD9bqCyaZBu1V5Ca.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2471,"name":"monarchy"},{"id":4833,"name":"royal family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
