With her stewardess Fanny Flint and the tour guide Simikry, she goes off to visit a sailors' bar. Fanny and Gabriele change clothes, which allows the stewardess to introduce herself as a fine lady. When Gabriele asks Fanny to leave with her, Fanny begs her to give her an hour more out of fear of embarrassment. Gabriele, however, is thrown out of the bar by the owner without money and papers; is picked up by the cops; and suffers a nervous breakdown, leading to her being sent to a hospital. No one believes in the slightest that she's really Gabriele Brodersen.","popularity":0.1796,"poster_path":"/cCf1XaUVWpwrVQtPNkJ0rQnboij.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tonfilmstudio Carl
