As the title suggests, it takes its basic narrative from the myth of Orpheus, and his courageous but ill-fated attempt to rescue his lover Eurydice (also known as Eurydike) from the jaws of the underworld. This particular production finds Yann Bridard dancing as Orpheus and Marie-Agnès Gillot dancing as Eurydike , with mezzo-soprano Maria-Riccarda Wesseling accompanying Bridard and soprano Julia Kleiter accompanying Wesseling. Pina Bausch did the choreography and stage direction, while Rolf Borzik designed the sets, costumes and lighting. The Balthasar-Neumann Ensemble & Choir, under the direction of Thomas Hengelbrock, lend musical accompaniment.","popularity":0.1319,"poster_path":"/s2TnRG2ybuRtUVGl22VxgYafkMi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15790,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Media","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orpheus and Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hengelbrock","original_name":"Thomas Hengelbrock","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"57939a81925141690f00a6a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yann Bridard","original_name":"Yann Bridard","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Orphée - First Dancer","credit_id":"57939a9392514156ab00031b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Riccarda Wesseling","original_name":"Maria Riccarda Wesseling","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/gGTfdx8GQQ9PD4H32XsTIfkH7tk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Orphée - The singers","credit_id":"57939aa092514156e6000332","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Agnès Gillot","original_name":"Marie-Agnès Gillot","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/amrDy4yBnQcLMUsgIDSSfez26oj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Eurydice - Star dancer","credit_id":"57939aaac3a3683ffb000334","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Kleiter","original_name":"Julia Kleiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Eurydice - The singers","credit_id":"57939ab1c3a36828a600b764","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miteki Kudo","original_name":"Miteki Kudo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Amour","credit_id":"57939abac3a36828a600b76e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunhae Im","original_name":"Sunhae Im","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Amour - The singers","credit_id":"57939ac4c3a36828a600b776","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","original_name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self - Orchestra","credit_id":"5ff92e65383df2003c343b4c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Bataillon","original_name":"Vincent Bataillon","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/nY43j6yQK29cGveoRt16jZNxf3H.jpg","credit_id":"579399c6c3a36862cd0097c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Bausch","original_name":"Pina Bausch","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/dJUPRQzvViez5k379xjEzDtQOUg.jpg","credit_id":"59484c32c3a36816e4045bcf","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","original_name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59484f4e9251413fdd04671c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2283210","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTqLke13sID5KIwFJL5alBXnH4l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a22vqJ0dVeTd3UV0GFMjrFd8kn9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":1625,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s2TnRG2ybuRtUVGl22VxgYafkMi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
