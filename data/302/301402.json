Everyone has their own way of dealing with grief. For Angela, writing was her comfort. Angela is married to Martin, newly pregnant and desperate to accomplish her dream of becoming a writer.

Life seems bleak and she begins to question her ability as a writer. Martin, failing to comprehend Angela's devotion to her passion, seeks attention elsewhere in the arms of another woman. He eventually abandons his wife and unborn child, sending Angela into a deep depression.
