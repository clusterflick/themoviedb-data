Muslim belief and tradition specifies that there should be no depictions of God or the Prophet Muhammad. In religious contexts, this constraint on what artists can depict extends to human figures and other living creatures as well. These prohibitions have inspired a rich visual culture based on calligraphy, Arabesque floral designs, and geometry, all of which feature strongly in the art and design found throughout Islam, including in mosques and the Koran. With the help of fine art and religion experts, host Rageh Omaar (The Life of Muhammad) traces the effect of these beliefs over the centuries on the art and artists of the Islamic world and considers why depictions of pilgrims taking part in the Hajj pilgrimage have become part of the accepted tradition of Islamic art, including in work exhibited at the British Museum.","popularity":0.1203,"poster_path":"/jz45ROUadv1Mmoc1E9HGURp0h8N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crescent Films (GB)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hidden Art of Islam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":573545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faris Kermani","original_name":"Faris Kermani","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a919ed0e5aba01387deefd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448933,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aaqil Ahmed","original_name":"Aaqil Ahmed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a91a4f7d2bc1012dea6e7c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951030,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Arrowsmith","original_name":"Tim Arrowsmith","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a91b02c4f552012a8e6ac9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4487405,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nayha Kalia","original_name":"Nayha Kalia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a91ab055c1f4012e89ec41","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461581,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jez Spencer","original_name":"Jez Spencer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a91b1855c1f4012889ea32","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Easton","original_name":"Adam Easton","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a91af2a6ddcb012c2485bb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2255975","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zNmyiKuoNU09Q9AnFJapL6ZDPcc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ie1nqunFlSJuJxX8VcpQ4mWwar0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2DSfnNg8ZItWC6GqkUu6KlvH5p9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jz45ROUadv1Mmoc1E9HGURp0h8N.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mpENdkcxXaD0Ky66EUwXBQlf2aJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
