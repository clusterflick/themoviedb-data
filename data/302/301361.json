The film, which features an unique overall vision incorporating both super 8mm film and digital video, follows a group of dynamic characters as they struggle with what it means to love, and to be loved. Unapologetic and unforgettably wild in its approach to combining Shakespeare and cinema, LOVE: AS YOU LIKE IT is simply not to be missed. This is not Shakespeare at its finest; this is Shakespeare the way its meant to be - bold, brave and brassy.","popularity":0.1083,"poster_path":"/j6gF2h7hqxtWKxfZBH5iEczSJNP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LOVE: As You Like It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1328421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Gulner","original_name":"Angela Gulner","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/kHz9XQtwWvS9aBMBNdg3l5gi4mD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rosalind","credit_id":"5941a5bd9251413c4a012f6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1833646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sullivan Jones","original_name":"Sullivan Jones","popularity":0.2838,"profile_path":"/fqd20PwzC5AIcCgOrUC6geAmmOJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Orlando","credit_id":"5941a6779251414b1d028e49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenne Klingaman","original_name":"Lenne Klingaman","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/D4nnFCPQKJupB9b8L3jVPaGqJh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Celia","credit_id":"5941a6d49251417a8301db0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1111213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Barletta","original_name":"Keith Barletta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/p5iaoCGWrw8mfHAw8qmxuBSWWFX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Touchstone","credit_id":"5941a6e9c3a3687ddb0124c1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arielle Brachfeld","original_name":"Arielle Brachfeld","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/2QCJ0YNnmvwZB0mGj6PaHiuAGk0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Audrey","credit_id":"5941a6fe9251417a8301db49","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Kaiser","original_name":"Alan Kaiser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gMtq4JUZ4Pt7NnOmNS2NBvf9Drs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Silvius","credit_id":"5941a7129251413c8c0139d2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Mannion","original_name":"Veronica Mannion","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/wnTXmpkHmY56XATCanxkjoSMBb6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Phebe","credit_id":"5941a7279251417a8301db79","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1053291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Ross","original_name":"Anna Ross","popularity":0.1773,"profile_path":"/hBWTzwy2OGV06vv1zyxZN5q5nEn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cafe Patron","credit_id":"5941a73fc3a368625701f86d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marika Sonja Cotter","original_name":"Marika Sonja Cotter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5941a5a69251414afb027bf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6gF2h7hqxtWKxfZBH5iEczSJNP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1014}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
