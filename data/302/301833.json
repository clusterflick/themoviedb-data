In the course of his work, Darrow meets Florence, an innocent young girl of the slums, and is attracted to her sweetness. Betty, Darrow's snobbish fianc√©e, becomes jealous and invites Florence to a reception, hoping to embarrass the girl. Florence comports herself admirably, however, and wins the respect of all present. The next day, on his way to the settlement house, Darrow is followed by gangster Tony Podessa, a jealous man from Florence's past. As Florence watches the two men confront each other, Tony is killed by a mysterious shot. The police arrive and arrest Darrow for the murder.","popularity":0.2305,"poster_path":"/sp1V8gXejLz9gmLQMdqBJLLaLuR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angel Factory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Moreno","original_name":"Antonio Moreno","popularity":0.3889,"profile_path":"/swsEgnc8bkILLcOjUDPGtZdXnQs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"David Darrow","credit_id":"545e83dec3a368535d006f3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Chadwick","original_name":"Helene Chadwick","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/hQ6wcUWMxCRed2DLRTpfutPtnuD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Florence Lamont","credit_id":"545e83f4c3a36841d30007e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":329782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Cortes","original_name":"Armand Cortes","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tony Podessa","credit_id":"545e84210e0a265477000a41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1383222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Greene","original_name":"Margaret Greene","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/uAynDIG7oVJKc2DQ6To7sYadVdO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"545e845cc3a36853500062db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Willa","original_name":"Suzanne Willa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marie Lacy","credit_id":"545e84c80e0a261fbd006fcc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Conlan","original_name":"Frank Conlan","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sailor Bill","credit_id":"545e84ddc3a36853500062eb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura West","original_name":"Laura West","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"545e8502c3a368536b006901","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence B.
