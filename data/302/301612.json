But Don does not fulfill his promise, and as a result, Karim's wife, Razia, and new-born son are left destitute. Razia complains to Police Inspector Anwar, who arrests Don and holds him in prison, pending his trial in court. When Anwar finds out that his new-born son, Iqbal, is in need of a pace-maker, which he is unable to afford, he makes a compromise with Don, who lets him have one. Iqbal undergoes surgery and a pace-maker number 786, considered lucky in Islamic faith, is attached to his tiny heart.","popularity":0.5113,"poster_path":"/4MS6nGHW6ufvWRpjMcWAXDx3Vpx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1986-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allah Rakha","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Shroff","original_name":"Jackie Shroff","popularity":0.9925,"profile_path":"/1UNJypgEyuihUW2avLLVYj76jie.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Allah Rakha","credit_id":"5bd563ef0e0a2622cc0277d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shammi Kapoor","original_name":"Shammi Kapoor","popularity":0.6693,"profile_path":"/qMv1oc2ZH6GKZ9b7BPtLfP6Y1KA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karim Khan","credit_id":"5bd563ff0e0a2622da028d9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waheeda Rehman","original_name":"Waheeda Rehman","popularity":0.5956,"profile_path":"/iErQ38ChGV6989lh1TU4SExMkWS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Advocate Salma Anwar","credit_id":"5bd5640892514103a0026970","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimple Kapadia","original_name":"Dimple Kapadia","popularity":1.4014,"profile_path":"/heNzOM1FsOJO2gtbOopP5NHcInQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julie Khera","credit_id":"5bd56411c3a3682112023b48","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meenakshi Sheshadri","original_name":"Meenakshi Sheshadri","popularity":0.6114,"profile_path":"/1EtxwGP3VELNVezOkeKrRgktFpz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rani","credit_id":"5bd5641f92514103a0026981","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":623417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bindu Desai","original_name":"Bindu Desai","popularity":0.3388,"profile_path":"/zD1ZSbQOIcs9k0KdKMsE1iJOpz6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Banoo","credit_id":"5bd564290e0a2622c3027af4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anupam Kher","original_name":"Anupam Kher","popularity":0.8891,"profile_path":"/f7hWJ4tvzR7uXmYoTiB41TpQ2NZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"R.
