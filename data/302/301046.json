This observational documentary loosely follows the rhythm of the restaurant’s day, which swings between boredom and frenzy as the old rooms empty and fill. No one who works at John’s is actually Italian, but some have been here for 40 years, including two pairs of brothers and a father and son. JOHN’S OF 12TH STREET catalogues the overlooked details of working life and a vanishing facet of New York City.","popularity":0.0743,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":107116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grand Motel Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John's of 12th Street","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa McDonnell","original_name":"Vanessa McDonnell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54623b26c3a3686f2e0025ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa McDonnell","original_name":"Vanessa McDonnell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54623b4fc3a3686f3c0026ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Schimberg","original_name":"Aaron Schimberg","popularity":0.2457,"profile_path":"/h3B3m62HD1YAyky3gWEIvOB7FN0.jpg","credit_id":"5b04fd4dc3a36864b40042a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa McDonnell","original_name":"Vanessa McDonnell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66968bad41ddac154b7b8bf6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3097330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
