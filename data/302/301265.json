He soon becomes a top chef and is so impressive that he enters a 'secret society' for chefs, who battle it out to see which one is the best. To his detriment he becomes so obsessive that the women in his life find him obnoxious and nothing seems likely to save him until the news of his patron's death slaps him in the face like a cold fish. In the end, the shock reminds him to keep his life in perspective.","popularity":0.2082,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinegram","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2005-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Chef, Like God","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Είναι ο Θεός Μάγειρας;","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yorgos Karamihos","original_name":"Γιώργος Καραμίχος","popularity":0.3882,"profile_path":"/thRvCCxhqXWd5LINXzEOmxjdwza.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Thodoros Notaras","credit_id":"56cd1d249251415cda000b7a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1194905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodora Tzimou","original_name":"Θεοδώρα Τζήμου","popularity":0.1594,"profile_path":"/fWaO0bmduIcUA3Sl9LfSKDMN5vq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Katerina","credit_id":"568afca1c3a3685f89015f75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1340205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexia Kaltsiki","original_name":"Αλεξία Καλτσίκη","popularity":0.3211,"profile_path":"/74CNluG1LBYgoBusAjjMUTznJ08.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dimitra","credit_id":"568afcc692514131df028ea7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1088946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ioanna Tsirigouli","original_name":"Ιωάννα Τσιριγκούλη","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/zW42Hult6LZpkgeVpRjjmWlRKZV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michelle","credit_id":"568afce4c3a36860e902c482","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgos Nakos","original_name":"Γιώργος Νάκος","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/rlMv593WvaHdTleYVIEwOUPCogX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Giorgos Stavrakas","credit_id":"568afd01c3a3680e01005b80","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":481026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Errikos Litsis","original_name":"Ερρίκος Λίτσης","popularity":0.3157,"profile_path":"/xZZ8OAtgIjoIZPl2XXk5X2TfJ2P.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pyrgiopoulos","credit_id":"568afd2a92514131df028ec1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilias Petropouleas","original_name":"Ηλίας Πετροπουλέας","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Cook Club President","credit_id":"56cd1dffc3a3682777000ce7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pantelis Kapsalis","original_name":"Pantelis Kapsalis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Pantelis","credit_id":"56cd1dff9251415cdc000ce6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2927991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Tsesmatzoglou","original_name":"Λίλη Τσεσματζόγλου","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/yK637wpjb588KqLx5U1V0GtxoYt.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"638ea5cc04733f0085d02008","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270561,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vasilis Raisis","original_name":"Βασίλης Ραίσης","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568afd5ac3a3683628014af0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stergios Niziris","original_name":"Stergios Niziris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568afd429251417c0600459c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0815190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ΕΙΝΑΙ Ο ΘΕΟΣ ΜΑΓΕΙΡΑΣ;","key":"EVQdlqLVNEQ","published_at":"2011-03-04T14:56:12.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"568afde89251414ecb01d794"}]}}}
