His budget, alas, does not include nor anticipate the plans of Sally and her parents. This short was reissued in June of 1950 to be shown as a trailer with 1950's \"Father of the Bride\" and some sources think this short was made for that express purpose and date it as a 1950 film.","popularity":0.2726,"poster_path":"/bHiW3KFsHolrm4wOkEyyXM1vJFg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wedding Bills","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Newell","original_name":"William Newell","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/ykA4ASS1IyxDR3691Gyt6c7l7RU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Groom-to-be (uncredited)","credit_id":"545f54700e0a262359001961","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Payne","original_name":"Sally Payne","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":"/dz5zx6oW8qVbFxqCQDrDLUSamIS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bride-to-be (uncredited)","credit_id":"545f5483c3a3686e49001b0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"56c79258c3a36813b40001b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Mack","original_name":"Roy Mack","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545f549ac3a3680b580003b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116849,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Buddy Adler","original_name":"Buddy Adler","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/pySEiex54LuqSk28jce4Qa8AwyR.jpg","credit_id":"56c7923592514172420001bb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96427,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Vogel","original_name":"Paul Vogel","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c79245c3a36813a00001f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0344547","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHiW3KFsHolrm4wOkEyyXM1vJFg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
