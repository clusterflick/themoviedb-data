In Metamorphosis you will explore their remarkable world as few ever have before.  Spectacular photography, computer animation and magnetic resonance imaging open once hidden doors to every stage of a butterfly's life-cycle. From an egg the size of a pinhead to a magnificent flying insect. It is a transformation so incredible biologists have called it \"butterfly magic.\"  How did these extraordinary creatures come into being? Are they the products of a blind, undirected process? Or were they designed by an intelligent cause?  Filmed in North, Central, and South America, Metamorphosis is an unforgettable documentary filled with the joys of discovery and wonder.","popularity":0.3928,"poster_path":"/ykk6sAYpkpm1fXJvgwImy8TEixj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illustra Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metamorphosis: The Design and Beauty of Butterflies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Chea","original_name":"Alvin Chea","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54804242c3a36817a5001f7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Nelson","original_name":"Paul Nelson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5480434cc3a36829a30021f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Emmel","original_name":"Thomas Emmel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"548043589251416e7e0022ab","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lad Allen","original_name":"Lad Allen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548041ddc3a36829ab002191","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ykk6sAYpkpm1fXJvgwImy8TEixj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156096,"name":"butterfly"},{"id":158276,"name":"metamorphosis"},{"id":161205,"name":"creationism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Metamorphosis: The Beauty & Design of Butterflies","key":"AZk6nZGH9Xo","published_at":"2011-06-02T21:38:16.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54803ec39251414efa001ffe"}]}}}
