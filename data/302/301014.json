With the help of their camera man Craig and the funding of the National Gun Owners of America, they are given the chance at a trial run, a documentary about the hunting experience. But when they cross the bridge and into the woods beyond, the hunters find themselves in the midst of the legend of Elizabeth, a vengeful specter willing to do whatever it takes to be reunited with her lost child. As the documentary progresses, the strange events continue to escalate to a deadly climax. Can the hunters save themselves from becoming the hunted, or are they doomed to be become a permanent part of the legend of Crybaby Bridge?","popularity":0.0693,"poster_path":"/4SNNKFTPpG8Gd4vxJVgQp3iySoZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crybaby Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Fross","original_name":"John Fross","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"63889f00a410c80079225a2c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2084577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Inks","original_name":"Jennifer Inks","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elizabeth Moore","credit_id":"63889f0d2e06970292e5dbb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Linck","original_name":"Bryan Linck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ryan","credit_id":"63889f1da410c80084853643","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Joseph Mackey","original_name":"Nicholas Joseph Mackey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Craig","credit_id":"63889f37a410c80079225a43","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Forrest Patterson","original_name":"Forrest Patterson","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63889eec1b157d008246defa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Forrest Patterson","original_name":"Forrest Patterson","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63889ee4229ae21572aae6cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2820006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/F5zo3Dn3FhzRSohriV2ONV4eWY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4SNNKFTPpG8Gd4vxJVgQp3iySoZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crybaby Bridge Movie Trailer","key":"l1lovnVcLJ8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-10-29T20:18:11.000Z","id":"5d6fda87e2bca81e2aac6154"}]}}}
