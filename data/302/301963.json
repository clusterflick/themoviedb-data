They hire two native guides to lead them into the woods, but the guides run in terror when they see a rather tame bear in the distance. Harold is annoyed that he cannot find any bears to hunt--unaware that two timid bears are closely following him. Meanwhile Snub encounters an equally tame wildcat who eats his picnic lunch. Snub sprints away. Back at the outpost, Harold twice rescues Jeanne--once from the clutches of an unwanted suitor and once from one of the bears. The grateful, gun-toting Jeanne tells Harold she wants him to be her \"sweetie.\"","popularity":0.2943,"poster_path":"/eG7o3JwDPe4A3Ih759TEDPYp8vv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Lloyd","original_name":"Harold Lloyd","popularity":0.3488,"profile_path":"/alOOCzYnr08aEYekwsA3onrdeXk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"A Millionaire","credit_id":"545fc431c3a368535800937d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","original_name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/srCQa37TG3RHKx5PuthzjsTpe6n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"His Valet","credit_id":"545fc481c3a3686e49002534","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Daniels","original_name":"Bebe Daniels","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/5vZGoSlVqUXFxilSEeApppLAfLL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeanne, Belle o' the Woods","credit_id":"545fc4a0c3a3686e49002537","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Housman","original_name":"Arthur Housman","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/2fPg5nQenEcivr5yAHDafZP76h9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"545fc50ec3a36841d3002e13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Jamison","original_name":"Bud Jamison","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/AiiqQpcsDraQqYxkKwwKHmCU0QE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"545fc51f0e0a262ca2000915","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Mosquini","original_name":"Marie Mosquini","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/wJBhBG8DX3BnUXE6tg2jbdGECKS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"545fc56e0e0a266177001d18","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Murray","original_name":"Tom Murray","popularity":0.1163,"profile_path":"/p80JeuEZeSrRpfmIYH47ARG47C4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"654f7befd465370138619cdf","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hal Roach","original_name":"Hal Roach","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/cV3xbMdZEQdNhHKdI9T6BL2PBSy.jpg","credit_id":"545fc398c3a36841d3002dfc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008860","wikidata_id":"Q3632642","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLk4NmBzUPzr2yHbvfCTPvy4eFY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1957,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eG7o3JwDPe4A3Ih759TEDPYp8vv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1305}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
