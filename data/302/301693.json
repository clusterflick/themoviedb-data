Its LowerTown district is a place where artists from all over the country moved into beautiful old houses, revitalizing a troubled neighborhood with the largest Artist Relocation Program ever. From an egg carver, to a print maker, to a sculptural ceramicist, to an art quilt master, this documentary combines artist profiles with interviews and archival photos to explore city history and the tradition of quilting in America.

Paul Moon.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ytX6StKYDxUjp9J8QsHvKdb1pDE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LowerTown Paducah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2252374","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytX6StKYDxUjp9J8QsHvKdb1pDE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":541}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
