Arriving there with his double-talking friend Shorty, Barry learns that a parcel of his vast ranch has been fraudulently sold to Carol Marland and her ailing (and tiresome) young brother Johnny. Pretending he is only the foreman, and having his cowhands go along with it,Barry allows Carol and her whining, growing-ever-more-tiresome brother to believe that they are the actual owners in order to give him a free hand in running down the swindlers who victimized Carol who, with a brother like hers, was a victim to begin with.Barry learns that brothers Clem and Jonas Allen are the villains and,through a ruse in which they are led to believe there is a hidden treasure on the land they sold Carol, they try to buy it back bidding against Barry, who forces the price up.","popularity":0.4976,"poster_path":"/uZz5hvXRXFtx1Yuruj6S3usBXae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14402,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spectrum Pictures (I)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SILVERY-VOICED BARITONE with the FLAMING STALLION, WHITE KING","title":"Romance Rides the Range","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Scott","original_name":"Fred Scott","popularity":0.3753,"profile_path":"/pjTEoagmq04LJUoGjUFrAX37KBl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Barry Glendon","credit_id":"545e529d0e0a267080000193","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Nazarro","original_name":"Cliff Nazarro","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/aC8CWA9B3Dm2w8OJWkXArqfhAFy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"'Shorty'","credit_id":"545e52a7c3a36853580065e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1013491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Shilling","original_name":"Marion Shilling","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/kDL2TvvBUlXMNUoVVPlw6CU2IBd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carol Marland","credit_id":"545e52b10e0a26042c006730","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buzz Barton","original_name":"Buzz Barton","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/f5alvKBNVpBRmSQGYeYYvE8Cn1B.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jimmy Marland","credit_id":"545e52bcc3a36853580065e6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Kortman","original_name":"Bob Kortman","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":"/hehu5JH7b44Pzcyeng3DF6pCoz0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clem Allen","credit_id":"545e52c5c3a36841d30003ca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Lorch","original_name":"Theodore Lorch","popularity":0.3577,"profile_path":"/yKsFtQczv5UMDpbPJtGa7qWONGy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jonas Allen","credit_id":"545e52d20e0a267080000197","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Yaconelli","original_name":"Frank Yaconelli","popularity":0.1579,"profile_path":"/q0p6jKMB1zGQo87leYUR3VGlUmc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"545e52dcc3a3685350005ecb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Dunham","original_name":"Phil Dunham","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":"/trbVo7S3tp02OY6bzFBP77Kaa2g.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"545e52f20e0a261fb6006da4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Evans","original_name":"Jack Evans","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Henchman Buck","credit_id":"545e52e6c3a368076e000a5d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Steuer","original_name":"Billy Steuer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Slick","credit_id":"545e52fcc3a36841d30003db","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"White King","original_name":"White King","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"White King - Barry's Horse","credit_id":"545e5306c3a3685350005ed6","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry L.
