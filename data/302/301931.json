As he only signs an \"M\" on his work, Monika has no difficulty in claiming she is \"M\", but problems arrive when she is commissioned to do a large mural and Maler refuses to help her out. However, his creative spirit gets the best of him and he does the mural which is widely acclaimed to be a great work of art. Felder , an art dealer, is not overly pleased with this turn of events as he has been pleading with Monika to divorce her shiftless husband and marry him.","popularity":0.2117,"poster_path":"/dJ52nCaz3YY8eR6pzk7g4lQbEHm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meteor Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1937-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Versprich mir nichts!","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luise Ullrich","original_name":"Luise Ullrich","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":"/6BHqlRddmtitVfxUyT4CLw2cRN6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monika","credit_id":"545f78f00e0a264d60002206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor de Kowa","original_name":"Viktor de Kowa","popularity":0.1448,"profile_path":"/dvlUa3op499BswbzyTKwZ2e8J8B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martin Pratt","credit_id":"545f79010e0a261fbd00911b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich George","original_name":"Heinrich George","popularity":0.157,"profile_path":"/pG7HbJEVnG44wOL1kgaeTVZbzL7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Felder","credit_id":"545f79100e0a262359001d29","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","original_name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/8APjW4PoDWOX3EmP0JHBsB06dpJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Elk","credit_id":"545f79240e0a262ca200021f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Dohm","original_name":"Will Dohm","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/bLfb9huX0cDpNQUInwXxYWp0q0Q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Konsul Brenkow","credit_id":"545f793bc3a3686cbb004158","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlott Daudert","original_name":"Charlott Daudert","popularity":0.1654,"profile_path":"/cEtK72kzKSZJKo8zYWW8MJfpd06.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vera Brenkow","credit_id":"545f794bc3a3680b5a00080a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Hermann Schaufuß","original_name":"Hans Hermann Schaufuß","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/6QZkPM54T2QVH8DXj3ODiplnvum.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Herr Lemke","credit_id":"59d7d96d92514125050158f7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1468384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilhelm P.
