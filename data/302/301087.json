During one of his shows, Samad found his audience distracted, and taking this as an insult to his art, gave up singing altogether. Badru is attracted to Samad's pretty daughter, Reshma, who also likes him. Badru has another admirer in the beautiful Naseem, but does not reciprocate her love. When Akhtar, a free lance photographer from Delhi, arrives there, Reshma and he instantly fall in love with each other, leaving behind a heartbroken Badru. When Akhtar proposes marriage, Samad angrily rejects him, as he wants Reshma to marry Nawab Hyder Ali's son, Basharat.","popularity":0.2825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2003-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woh Tera Naam Tha","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arjan Bajwa","original_name":"Arjan Bajwa","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/xs3nHpwwc4z46EthrTLJjub5nPs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f26f643dbbb420036e488ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajat Bedi","original_name":"Rajat Bedi","popularity":0.2526,"profile_path":"/h6hJw3QLAoJjZBvdxHF2QhTR3PO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f26f649869e75003860d4a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prem Chopra","original_name":"Prem Chopra","popularity":0.421,"profile_path":"/4hLAhScWZA6utfg8VCivwVH6FHy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f26f64e2d8ef30037dd25ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javed Khan","original_name":"Javed Khan","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/dYi2y5kxKRCRty0llXlt2sDO5xb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f26f65f9f37b0003422ad23","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yunus Parvez","original_name":"Yunus Parvez","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":"/8y0u0NS7j9lzffw8ePGxf6NNLpr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f26f664dbbb420034e35f5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amrish Puri","original_name":"Amrish Puri","popularity":1.5076,"profile_path":"/uhMGFS7tuG71LDv2wk9LfZZ4EG6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f26f66ae263bb003405c651","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajeev Verma","original_name":"Rajeev Verma","popularity":0.1253,"profile_path":"/aJZQAksd12d8cV8Zjo3IUnaH7Rm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f26f66fefe37c0036bce3dd","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kuku Kohli","original_name":"Kuku Kohli","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f26f637d9403500355e3d5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0386121","wikidata_id":"Q8029079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
