Romero), comes a bold new vision that blurs the line between game and horror cinema.  Follow the camera behind the scenes of one of the most talked-about TV commercials ever made, created in collaboration with Brad Renfro and some of Hollywood’s top talent.  Based on the world of Resident Evil, the hit survival horror game that had already terrified millions since its debut in 1996, this commercial heralds the arrival of its highly anticipated sequel.  Breaking a two-year silence, director Romero returns with a haunting production of cinematic ambition. With a staggering budget of over 150 million yen (more than one million USD), the shoot took place on a chilling replica of a Los Angeles police station, transformed into the shadowy world of Raccoon City.","popularity":0.1462,"poster_path":"/pavYAsiAE8jcLmCdtLpmAey8b9A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7220,"logo_path":"/dD0x5awPmtx4sAr2pNvkmxkCODh.png","name":"Capcom","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I wanted to make a film instead of a commercial. —George A.
