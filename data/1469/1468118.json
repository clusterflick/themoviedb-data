The voice of artistic reason rises above orgiastic visuals that splash across the pages of glue-bound volumes oozing with sticky subjects of a carnal persuasion. Come and rejoice in the mayhem and frivolity that only Eros unchained can deliver. The soiled and the damned live again on the glossy pages of glue-bound tabloids ticketed for hell and beyond. Witness the innocent and the fun-loving as they become documented fodder for light sensitive materials too hot to handle. Get down and dirty with a deluge of messy mischief destined to flood your libido with a backwash of coffee table books that will titillate and terrify. Meet the man behind the mayhem and marvel at the clarity of it all. Itâ€™s also a cake-bashing, birthday celebration.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A video portrait of photographer Charles Gatewood","title":"The Gates of Gomorrah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1589171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Gatewood","original_name":"Charles Gatewood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tKyv089K6FMJ1GVZUu41XaCNHkR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68061ad803344aee708a0aeb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"68061b01059fbcecf6aac2ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
