Neil Armstrong and the Langholmites is a film about the day one of the world’s most famous men visited the small ‘burgh’ of Langholm and the profound emotional effect the place, and its people, had on the normally stoic astronaut. From Industria Studios and Duncan Cowles, director of acclaimed 2024 feature Silent Men, comes a wry and beautiful slice of Scottish life and a unique, lesser-known tale about one of America’s most famous sons.","popularity":0.1615,"poster_path":"/67lNkOrAF0gngdet3Mw7QyutuFi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":260136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Industria
