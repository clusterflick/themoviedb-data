And determined to put his horrific accident in '76 behind him. Despite Lauda's poor start and total of only 3 wins for the season, he picked up points at all but three GPs, and was rewarded for his consistency with his second championship victory. Lauda chose not to complete the season, and instead, Ferrari gave the drive to a young and ambitious Gilles Villeneuve.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/aq95g2M8lbSkzg58hLR4hP6DFla.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16987,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brunswick Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lauda's Comeback: Formula One 1977 - A Review Of The 1977 Grand Prix Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niki Lauda","original_name":"Niki Lauda","popularity":0.4185,"profile_path":"/tGYoMEe3v9EE0DzlTVaXTOzLSmy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68061a9d059fbcecf6aac2c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1562265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jody Scheckter","original_name":"Jody Scheckter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/46wy2Q6lufEaO4upkOXDnmAAmCZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68061aae03344aee708a0ad5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Andretti","original_name":"Mario Andretti","popularity":0.1396,"profile_path":"/d73LeLNJT02qEJ8ay0gY5GDcW4t.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68061ab6276bf64e41aac410","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Reutemann","original_name":"Carlos Reutemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/h2EZH8OYZTfiOabsl2HnXxGEYEk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68061abb03344aee708a0adb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1249590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hunt","original_name":"James Hunt","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/hRXu8iNe44ZZI2xlB6B0S9q0zPx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68061ac103344aee708a0ae1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2851788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Mass","original_name":"Jochen Mass","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/wuhFyjXc4xO1rxLQeFPXDDgDiKH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68061ac56e1a769e81ee4b3e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Jones","original_name":"Alan Jones","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/2RPIxheoiruHh35vRn2WKcxn5jR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68061acdac02d4407baab74a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emerson Fittipaldi","original_name":"Emerson Fittipaldi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ojxDE7IZ0XBR4iYXTL0WMz6AeUk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"68061adc059fbcecf6aac2de","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Watson","original_name":"John Watson","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":"/xWGXP8Z4MVCPs7gcNihUvRjuxjA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"68061ae86e1a769e81ee4b4d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1562218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Peterson","original_name":"Ronnie Peterson","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/8GU6sJC0ZKG3EsRGKDwSXLV24Ae.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"68061aef37a722b8868a0bb8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Carlos Pace","original_name":"José Carlos Pace","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xMHg65slb2YifAZhzZZwEZYT4Pn.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"68061af503344aee708a0af4","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5290530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Regazzoni","original_name":"Clay Regazzoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6tAManm95oEJpw61fqd3hQxdpuA.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"68061b01b659822812ee498c","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":763390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Villeneuve","original_name":"Gilles Villeneuve","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/A9SjDL1Q0LGH7xEcVijPeCFsikQ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"68061b0903344aee708a0b01","order":12}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aq95g2M8lbSkzg58hLR4hP6DFla.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
