Three years later, Kantaro, who was rumored to be dead, was reported to have appeared at a boarding house upstream of the Tenryu River by Genkō, a horseman who had been saved by Kantaro. O-Mitsu, the daughter of Chokai-ji Temple, who had secretly been in love with Kantaro, was thrilled by the rumor and told her father, the monk Ryokai, about it. However, Ryokai was none other than the one who had rescued Kantaro from the boarding house three years earlier and had secretly sent him to Edo.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1952-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"勘太郎月夜唄","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuo Hasegawa","original_name":"長谷川一夫","popularity":0.4291,"profile_path":"/mt39pz3FtpDCb4vzNdMt3MSN4Tg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b480ac02d4407bab0c97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nobuko Otowa","original_name":"乙羽信子","popularity":0.7652,"profile_path":"/6vcByiFlOE9JiLGWNKRtN8k0uil.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b48815a1d5a614aa7f73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyōko Kagawa","original_name":"香川京子","popularity":0.5194,"profile_path":"/q47wPwySJvhj6HQoYb7ON1TjbcV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b491271ecb3ae089a3e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yūji Hori","original_name":"堀雄二","popularity":0.1655,"profile_path":"/x5ABNcMyeRuEwaJm6EGY3xNwq14.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b49c15a1d5a614aa7f7c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Entatsu Yokoyama","original_name":"横山エンタツ","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/xhpqMYbK7RMW3dWVQxYUP1zK4gP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b4a5b082db6279ee1f91","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nijiko Kiyokawa","original_name":"清川虹子","popularity":0.4296,"profile_path":"/4vGxJRwHHCwCkXmf6flTXYBffGI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b4bd15a1d5a614aa7f91","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1366545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumiko Hasegawa","original_name":"長谷川裕見子","popularity":0.2789,"profile_path":"/hKVtxf8oRC9cTwMOVO1c1SMUO20.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b4cb142b09cecf899879","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsuhiko Tasaka","original_name":"田坂勝彦","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807b4786e1a769e81eea94c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1952-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
