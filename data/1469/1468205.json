Journey past opulent cottages and boathouses. Watch steamships ply the waters just as they did a century ago. Visit long lost resorts, an historic inn, a boat-only church and an eerie shipwreck. The Muskoka Lakes are a place of contrast; a mixture of wooden heritage cottages and billionaire steel and glass cottages, stunning resorts combined with slices of pristine wilderness.","popularity":0.0477,"poster_path":"/mpamzBA7w8AMH6cFf2OU1eV6zmO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TRIPPING The Muskoka Lakes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mpamzBA7w8AMH6cFf2OU1eV6zmO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | TRIPPING | The Muskoka Lakes | 4K | TVO Original","key":"b42gxQrz438","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-04T14:15:02.000Z","id":"68064e14b659822812ee5bd8"}]}}}
