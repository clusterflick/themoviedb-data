When she returned to Japan from French Indochina, people started talking about her. Hina was once the wife of Hiroshi Sasagawa, but was imprisoned and divorced after stabbing her cruel mother-in-law. While in prison, she gave birth to a daughter, Yukiko, and was given to her by her dance teacher, Tatsuo Kuribayashi, while still in her baby clothes. Hina had returned home because she missed her daughter. Since the incident with Hina, her family's fortunes have declined and she lives in poverty, but her brother, Junkichi, stubbornly refuses to see Hina. He finally finds out where the Kuribayashi family is, meets Tatsuo, and asks him to return Yukiko to him, but he refuses, saying that he cannot let go of Yukiko, who he had raised with care.","popularity":0.0688,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"「幻なりき」より 郷愁","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukiko Todoroki","original_name":"轟夕起子","popularity":0.5037,"profile_path":"/vdFiE6vIBTJgd2EiKH5Fpsvb7pB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b37115a1d5a614aa7dd3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiko Kishi","original_name":"岸恵子","popularity":0.7018,"profile_path":"/2jSCjRGlI7N3WajaLoqJoia3qAV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b37b15a1d5a614aa7dd9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":944892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shūji Sano","original_name":"佐野周二","popularity":0.4748,"profile_path":"/2qdwk7i1BE4H3OwpiuDkYiDq1ZF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b38315a1d5a614aa7dec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuniko Miyake","original_name":"三宅邦子","popularity":0.3085,"profile_path":"/pdiArweSY1CPCA607PSOgTglqXN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b38cac02d4407bab0b8e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chishū Ryū","original_name":"笠智衆","popularity":0.8625,"profile_path":"/md0GCQUr0ktyjigmnFhRRhIE1tK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b392ac02d4407bab0b93","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minoru Takada","original_name":"高田稔","popularity":0.2635,"profile_path":"/riwP00KobJzqQSvsa0FFfJVuy3R.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6807b39ac3e8e74b6deea3ba","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2530309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsuruo Iwama","original_name":"岩間鶴夫","popularity":0.2454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807b363271ecb3ae089a346","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
