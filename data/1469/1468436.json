The subjects-close friends of the artist with shared experiences of the city's waning subcultural landscape-are shown navigating places that no longer resonate with the complexity of contemporary \"scenes,\" emphasizing the relational gaps in 21st-century youth culture. The Over-Scene creates a dialogue between multiple points in history, illustrating the duality of longing for a unified subcultural community-often influenced by commemorations of the past-while simultaneously striving to forge one's own identity and sense of place in today's world.","popularity":0.0501,"poster_path":"/1oSFtOTtbB60z9K2u0Y8gAcUddb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's an emptiness here.
