The film intersperses archival footage from the 1990s-2010s, following Crofton from Nashville to pre-COVID exile in Los Angeles — including a pivotal roller skating injury — and features commentary/appearances by departed local luminaries Dave Cloud and David Berman. Plenty of living luminaries show up as well, including Neil Hamburger and My Morning Jacket’s Jim James in a crucial “save.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hargrove House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Chris Crofton: Nashville Famous","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Crofton","original_name":"Chris Crofton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6807d84ac5c8035fb08a7a82","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Pomeroy","original_name":"Seth Pomeroy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807d8836e1a769e81eeb010","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Belcourt Theatre, Nashville, TN","release_date":"2025-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
