Rushmore Park Ranger as she navigates an onslaught of interactive fundraising emails that appear on a transparent interface, leading up to the 2016 Presidential election. The narrative arc of the movie is based on the urgent, alarmist, and oddly personalized campaign and fundraising emails from the Democrats and Republicans (i.e. Hillary Has Been Emailing You… or WE QUIT: but we don’t want to quit). Serving as both narrator and foil to the ranger, the emails perform the pervasive political rhetoric in today’s systems of governance; while acting as a meditation on the National Park Service and politics.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MT RUSH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Read","original_name":"Julia Read","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ann","credit_id":"58dc5cc99251414110000e2d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1716523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Orr","original_name":"Elizabeth Orr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dc5cd992514140ea000ef5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
