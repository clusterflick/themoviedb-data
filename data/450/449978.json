Rigoletto encourages and welcomes the Duke's conquests, pitilessly mocking his victims until he discovers that the Duke has abducted the one person he genuinely loves, his own daughter. As a result, the character of the court jester is transformed into a tragic figure who, in spite of his evident immorality and malice, allows us to sense the devotion he feels for his daughter and his horror at being destroyed by the same despotic world as that which he himself has helped to create.","popularity":0.1611,"poster_path":"/juzNeW2bTTOP5JKDWfiev1OUT5g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gran Teatre del
