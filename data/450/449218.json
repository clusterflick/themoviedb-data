This film goes back to its beginning and those who felt called to plant an oasis of Christianity in the North American wilderness. In an imaginative, at times almost surrealistic, way the film recalls the highborn company from France, and shows what survives of Ville-Marie in the Montreal of today.","popularity":0.5085,"poster_path":"/usReUFd4u9LYd10nAjy4wJ05iCv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ville-Marie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Marsolais","original_name":"Gilles Marsolais","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64788ff617497300c13113e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1497332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gisèle Trépanier","original_name":"Gisèle Trépanier","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/8XMyfOTPfKeJb3Iijwu4U1YKhOm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64789010e323f30148155181","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denys Arcand","original_name":"Denys Arcand","popularity":0.6154,"profile_path":"/jYqHVVAHbhNvFCMmi2wUm8IanRp.jpg","credit_id":"58d91fea9251411faa06e01a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"André Belleau","original_name":"André Belleau","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64783aae93828e0133764411","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrée Thibault","original_name":"Andrée Thibault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64783abccf4b8b01031ce6b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel Brault","original_name":"Michel Brault","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/bDGiQWl2UblKpR9h1qFQ3THUsj1.jpg","credit_id":"64783a271749730135ffed89","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monique Fortier","original_name":"Monique Fortier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64783a9a93828e00dcdb4138","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64783a720e29a200f9804079","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Leduc","original_name":"Jacques Leduc","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/loS8GxqZmGvpB8JXyiOx45pSlCe.jpg","credit_id":"64783a86cf4b8b01418d9eff","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0251855","wikidata_id":"Q65115179","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/usReUFd4u9LYd10nAjy4wJ05iCv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6719,"name":"montreal, canada"},{"id":207684,"name":"canadian history"},{"id":279551,"name":"new france"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
