Clipson and Onda each investigate very personal, intuitive spaces, through their favored technologies of Super 8mm film and cassette Walkman. Both artists base a significant emphasis of their work on performance environments, where their visual and sonic field recordings interact to create sensory collages born out of the subjective impressions of the audience.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":"/p4IljWGMphRgL0VAMlAvuujTh8g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ephemeris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2513802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aki Onda","original_name":"Aki Onda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628421c1b4a543005135be08","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Clipson","original_name":"Paul Clipson","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/4ecKNR4AJhTel2ttjaACIoryRgc.jpg","credit_id":"58dd6ec4925141596700057d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":976,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p4IljWGMphRgL0VAMlAvuujTh8g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":651}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Paul Clipson & Aki Onda - Ephemeris, 2011","key":"36207040","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2012-02-04T22:10:03.000Z","id":"6284218065686e006693a650"}]}}}
