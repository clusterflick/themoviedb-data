Does the sick three-legged hound stand any chance of getting adopted, becoming healthy again and running across the fields of Essex? Why are the Greekies, the strays from Greece, so popular when it comes to being adopted abroad? With an unexpected ending, the film tries to discover whether there is any hope for the doomed dogs and for a doomed area outside Athens.","popularity":0.3347,"poster_path":"/uEFIILM0qGaP8uD4tJvcJBFDBMn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rescue, Animals, Documentary","title":"Greek Animal Rescue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Menelaos Karamaghiolis","original_name":"Μενέλαος Καραμαγγιώλης","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/oEiD4oV9cIsuogAq6ov5U0fdDOu.jpg","credit_id":"58d7feabc3a368121b054081","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784212,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tania Freimuth","original_name":"Tania Freimuth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d7fed4c3a368121b0540a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1444716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stelios Bouziotis","original_name":"Stelios Bouziotis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d7ff789251411f9005b787","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dimitrius Peponis","original_name":"Dimitrius Peponis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d7ff059251411f9005b71e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Menelaos Karamaghiolis","original_name":"Μενέλαος Καραμαγγιώλης","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/oEiD4oV9cIsuogAq6ov5U0fdDOu.jpg","credit_id":"58d7fef2c3a368128905aa42","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Menelaos Karamaghiolis","original_name":"Μενέλαος Καραμαγγιώλης","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/oEiD4oV9cIsuogAq6ov5U0fdDOu.jpg","credit_id":"58d7fee59251411fd505b40d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1444715,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dimitris Peponis","original_name":"Δημήτρης Πεπόνης","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d7ff2c925141448e0108c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uEFIILM0qGaP8uD4tJvcJBFDBMn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":223378,"name":"animal rescue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"Thessaloniki International Film Festival","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Greek Animal Rescue","key":"LG_Btuej2OE","published_at":"2017-03-06T15:28:16.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"58d8008d925141442f0100d9"}]}}}
