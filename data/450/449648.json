I shot at the site of Marin Headlands County in California when I was an artist in residence at the Headlands Center for the Art. The footage shows the nature in the area, as well as the historic buildings originally built for the US Army, including batteries and the Nike Missile Site. It was all edited in camera and hand-processed afterwards.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/mvQJU7rCE44JxwfsHbyGtJEBory.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sketch Film #5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomonari Nishikawa","original_name":"Tomonari Nishikawa","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/mT80BkuO49rYX4ED7B6L2k5d6uj.jpg","credit_id":"58dc6d029251414126001d13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2884538","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mvQJU7rCE44JxwfsHbyGtJEBory.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
