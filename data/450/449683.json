But the band had seven consecutive gold albums throughout the 90s, sold out their own festival for the last ten years and run their own creative centre, the Metway. Via the eccentric artist, archivist, whiskey loving bassist Jeremy Cunningham we are taken on a journey; how the band rose to fame and how they survived. A potted history of 25 years of subsidised dysfunctionalism. An uplifting tale of battling demons, that reminds us that behind every band there is always a story of struggle for expression, acceptance and survival.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/x3XAEn9VmcqDwDSQfLwvqQ2Iq6b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A
