Hamburglar dreams up a crazy scheme to use the time machine to get out of cleaning and they end up getting lost in time. Their time travel adventures take them to prehistoric times where the time machine is nearly digested by a Tyrannosaurus and they meet their cavemen ancestors, the medieval times where they impress the crabby King Murray with a musical number to save captured Birdie, the wild wild west where they discover Hamburglar's ancestor Henry H. Burglar II, whom the residents mistake Hamburglar for, and the disco era of the '70s where they briefly encounter Mayor McCheese.","popularity":2.2941,"poster_path":"/x9mOHhJBrKtDdS2aLHydU05TMl0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59150,"logo_path":"/owpGkEh53XCB9dNoLpuaxvcLCOy.png","name":"Klasky-Csupo","origin_country":"US"},{"id":112952,"logo_path":"/pK7rvw6DItFG5kssJgm1R7Ae6sM.png","name":"McDonald's","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald: Have Time, Will Travel","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Adler","original_name":"Charlie Adler","popularity":0.5606,"profile_path":"/hVENHdlEqsX6vhBW4MTpfYEFFQ3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hamburglar (voice)","credit_id":"5a4eeacd0e0a2657680051a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1733204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hussey","original_name":"David Hussey","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ronald McDonald","credit_id":"5a4eeaee9251417a6000501c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee Bradley Baker","original_name":"Dee Bradley Baker","popularity":1.3802,"profile_path":"/9oFnToDZWp0I484s7Ua1EzNQQ2m.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sundae / TV Monitor (voice)","credit_id":"66a927b1e1d640deea59c6b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Cavanaugh","original_name":"Christine Cavanaugh","popularity":0.2727,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Birdie (voice)","credit_id":"66a927c519edcb7512b435c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Michael Richardson","original_name":"Kevin Michael Richardson","popularity":1.5699,"profile_path":"/xXt9Nh7RAT5bOen66TaXreNYmCl.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Grimace (voice)","credit_id":"66a927ddc6c84bdc775c438d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Burton","original_name":"Corey Burton","popularity":0.9466,"profile_path":"/wcpFwdL7m01cZoBJiUSMQVakK2G.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Bug / Mob Man #1 (voice)","credit_id":"66a928006585ebb63cf2aa55","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Joles","original_name":"Bob Joles","popularity":0.4539,"profile_path":"/ohczCcTm5u8Grlf5KGxjDZiQkI.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Mayor McCheese / Mob Man #2 / Knight (voice)","credit_id":"66a9281708dbe0dcbb02e9d1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice LaMarche","original_name":"Maurice LaMarche","popularity":1.0046,"profile_path":"/qCiL3EYAhLcNo0rNj5pczWo9MwG.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Dr. Quizzical / Burger Chef / Knight (voice)","credit_id":"66a9286a748ca24fb35c49c7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Cummings","original_name":"Jim Cummings","popularity":1.2978,"profile_path":"/c0sQPRCM5Ri3F4gVyxPr4AcPmIq.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Announcer (voice)","credit_id":"66a9287de30674ee99dab288","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex D.
