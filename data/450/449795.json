Notions of time, space, and memory collide within a visual fabric of abstractions, landscapes, textures, superimpositions and graphic forms, to suggest the first moments of dream-sleep.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/s9WBHA4ziemLBPQyKRiAl1tu7mX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sphinx on the Seine","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Clipson","original_name":"Paul Clipson","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/4ecKNR4AJhTel2ttjaACIoryRgc.jpg","credit_id":"61544095d1ca2a00673d32ae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jefre Cantu-Ledesma","original_name":"Jefre Cantu-Ledesma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6154408dd1ca2a00906c3d59","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Clipson","original_name":"Paul Clipson","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/4ecKNR4AJhTel2ttjaACIoryRgc.jpg","credit_id":"58dd8fac9251411b7f000046","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6604442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jKpsgSct5OprlxuhFcj8ktWQukN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s9WBHA4ziemLBPQyKRiAl1tu7mX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2009-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
