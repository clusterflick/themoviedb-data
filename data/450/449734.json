Eliot Ness, fresh from his legendary Chicago triumph over Al Capone and associates, set his sights on Cleveland and went on a crusade that matched, and sometimes even surpassed, his past accomplishments. Dismembered body parts have started washing up in a concentrated area of Lake Erie Sound. Their headless torsos have left no clues to their identity or the reason for death. Elliot Ness and his colorful gang of “The Unknowns” chased this killer through the underbelly of Cleveland for years. As far as the public was concerned he was never captured. But what really happened is even more shocking.","popularity":0.3203,"poster_path":"/61URIOLOp0eJAdaadLgZ4toqBgR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"Ness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Greengrass","original_name":"Paul Greengrass","popularity":0.6854,"profile_path":"/kJxQWrERq8p7gxRP2fIcS8suwme.jpg","credit_id":"58dd1d6cc3a368229300c9b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Andreyko","original_name":"Marc Andreyko","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dd1d9292514140f200cce0","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382000,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Michael Bendis","original_name":"Brian Michael Bendis","popularity":0.2109,"profile_path":"/zYcyWooAjXFJCU7GVyzvHDqpPP0.jpg","credit_id":"58dd1da7c3a368228a00b4ef","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4723,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Helgeland","original_name":"Brian Helgeland","popularity":0.5373,"profile_path":"/3nva1KGfPZMhqxBnr5PymluTOxf.jpg","credit_id":"58dd1dbe925141411000ce05","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382000,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Michael Bendis","original_name":"Brian Michael Bendis","popularity":0.2109,"profile_path":"/zYcyWooAjXFJCU7GVyzvHDqpPP0.jpg","credit_id":"58dd1dfec3a36822a600cd9d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Andreyko","original_name":"Marc Andreyko","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dd1e09c3a368229d00bea2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Greengrass","original_name":"Paul Greengrass","popularity":0.6854,"profile_path":"/kJxQWrERq8p7gxRP2fIcS8suwme.jpg","credit_id":"58dd1e30925141412600c177","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0497989","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/61URIOLOp0eJAdaadLgZ4toqBgR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
