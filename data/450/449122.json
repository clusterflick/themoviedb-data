If that hadn’t happened, I would have died. I just made my first album straight this year.”  On June 25, 1996, as part of a court order, Steve Earle performed a live concert for prison inmates at Tennessee’s Cold Creek Correctional Facility where Earle was incarcerated in 1994. The concert entitled To Hell and Back aired on MTV on August 17, 1996. Steve reunited with his backing group the Dukes for the concert, and it was an incredible show.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xqRsb7C1tsuTNWSeN6ikGPISgLO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Country music singer Steve Earle performs some of his best-known songs.
