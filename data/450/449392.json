It is of little matter where these migrants come from, as it is, above all, a matter of staying alive and avoiding the gangs that keep an eye on the long path to exile. However, everyone knows the goal: to get into the north of the continent, the United States or Canada, at all costs, aboard goods trains, which they hang onto dangerously. In complete immersion, Hubert Caron-Guay filmed this last chance voyage in which waiting contends with anguish, even though solidarity is tangible at times, like in the sequence where a man enjoins his companions in misfortune to “run at the same speed as the train”, otherwise, death is certain.","popularity":0.0665,"poster_path":"/h6YQXJlAamPFxbkJ7z5U0zR6eB5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29201,"logo_path":"/93Cu4sHMvJLgCwk9wpQY5xrb3XA.png","name":"Les Films de L'Autre","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destierros","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1785357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hubert Caron-Guay","original_name":"Hubert Caron-Guay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pyCTosdcKboOY22ublvfkY4wXh5.jpg","credit_id":"58da8e24c3a3684637000319","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8255430","wikidata_id":"Q65055292","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pLs1m33oy5RmD2wHsyj56TCdNxe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/h6YQXJlAamPFxbkJ7z5U0zR6eB5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1372,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/j9OykUins2FQCC70ESAhxd0FxgE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":922}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
