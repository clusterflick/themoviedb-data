One of the most popular aspects of the TR7 history is the Abingdon Works rally programme. We're often asked if there is any film of the rally cars in action and thanks to ex-Competitions Manager, Bill Price, there certainly is! Bill allowed us to use the footage he'd shot on Super 8 film which had never previously been transferred to video.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yJFJqlWEuMpKjWtr0Dda3520yDc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Codename: Bullet","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lFeh5qd28AeWAy6erDCghk4ZzmY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fbgli6YnyEiT9ehENa5b4DuE6Sr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yJFJqlWEuMpKjWtr0Dda3520yDc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
