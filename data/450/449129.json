It was known in antiquity times for its Phoenix and Rukh birds. Frankincense and myrrh trees grow freely, as well as the dragon's blood tree proved by Egyptians, greeks and romans. The first commercial flights, at the start of this century marked, for almost a couple of decades, the end of Socotra's century of isolation. The current situation of civil war in Yemen has isolated again the remote island. In the film, a group of camel drivers heads to the secret interior of Socotra before the rainy season and they explain by the fire ancient stories of djinns and giant snakes.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/iyziEMRWCJgmgOjTYABjdzI6neY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Siwa Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YE","name":"Yemen"}],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Socotra, the Land of Djinns","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordi Esteva","original_name":"Jordi Esteva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e83676fcb6db50014b206e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584940,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Albert Serradó","original_name":"Albert Serradó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e83678b3acd200015385535","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordi Esteva","original_name":"Jordi Esteva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e836763d100b60014c27ba4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordi Esteva","original_name":"Jordi Esteva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e836798383df2001217f747","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5127200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":850,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/iyziEMRWCJgmgOjTYABjdzI6neY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":578},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/3vNdnuuEUzxRgur1jjBHPs9jaOu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
