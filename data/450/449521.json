The fish gasps for air and the fisherman holds it to his chest until it dies. This sequence—performed by a series of fishermen, of various ages and using various styles of capture—is the spine of the work, interrupted by passages of quiet natural beauty; one shot is a steady, stately pan through scores of trees and empty air behind.\" - Vinson Cunningham","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/4S52qq0a02BhVXU7Og8cUxa5tUD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fish","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathas de Andrade","original_name":"Jonathas de Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dbb5ce92514133b900b478","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7280632","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1119,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v9xGM7oqs8hmLevVTyXc5Si9Uzx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":829},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYTjqyr7MVeu9g4DwJpou7ZbkER.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":844,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4S52qq0a02BhVXU7Og8cUxa5tUD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Vimeo","release_date":"2016-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
