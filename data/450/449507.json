This voyage is a mere pretext meant to reconnect the two childhood friends, who were separated for ten years. With a rare sensitivity, Tao Gu films this companion, who was lost not only “from view”, approaching him stealthily to capture all of his tragic intensity, his disillusioned generosity. Dong has remained a dreamer besotted with rock, an incensed body struggling to find money (he comes up with a jade business which does not work out), love, sex and, above all, to live following his own conceptions of liberty, under the ambiguous gaze of his parents and his “successful” brother.","popularity":0.0681,"poster_path":"/uXdEkin1z36FqUb8XIjy6dY8kYK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taming the Horse","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Xun Ma","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2109254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tao Gu","original_name":"Tao Gu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b764215c3a368754501cd6d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2109254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tao Gu","original_name":"Tao Gu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b76420b9251411d9101c683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1107201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xun Yu","original_name":"Xun Yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b764328c3a368754201c195","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2109255,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aonan Yang","original_name":"Aonan Yang","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7642a09251411d8901da6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2109254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tao Gu","original_name":"Tao Gu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b76426a0e0a265c27020eb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1107201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xun Yu","original_name":"Xun Yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7643310e0a265c2d01f837","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5831124","wikidata_id":"Q56302271","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1034,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXdEkin1z36FqUb8XIjy6dY8kYK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
