The uncompromising commune chief who has ruled the village for years has denied the request of his people to migrate to other lands in search of better luck. He took away their only lifeline: Hope. But one night, the prayers of a spiritual leader are heard by a mighty tree in the forest. The following day, a young mysterious woman appears on a nearby river shore. To the surprise of the villagers, the chief decides to give her a seven-day trial to see if she could be useful to the community. From that day on, a series of strange events began to happen, leaving the villagers to wonder whether if this strange woman is their savior or their executioner.","popularity":0.116,"poster_path":"/n7C9iqRgIhS7wqrlTkkDxAniD4A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"}],"release_date":"2016-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest Whispers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dara Our","original_name":"Dara Our","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/ybsFSM1k1ZrPU0cffGqL5WAniqU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Farmer Son","credit_id":"58d8588c9251411fd5060090","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lida Duch","original_name":"Lida Duch","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Stranger","credit_id":"58d85898c3a368125f05cb13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sisowath Siriwudd","original_name":"Sisowath Siriwudd","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Commune Chief","credit_id":"58d858a69251411fdc062546","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sok Sothun","original_name":"Sok Sothun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Spiritual Leader","credit_id":"58d858b7c3a368124f05d6bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chhorvy Sem","original_name":"Chhorvy Sem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sokhana","credit_id":"58d858c5925141442f014b3c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1734163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jimmy Henderson","original_name":"Jimmy Henderson","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d85826c3a368127c05bfa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1734163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jimmy Henderson","original_name":"Jimmy Henderson","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d8587d9251411fdc062504","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5598246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.729,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n7C9iqRgIhS7wqrlTkkDxAniD4A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
