While there, Barney and the Backyard Gang tour the studio on their own, while producing their own show. From a cereal commercial set and a puppet show and the six little ducks and teddy bears and the US flag and an island paradise and a make up place to a jungle, the show is filmed along with many props in the studio. With the power of imagination and some movie magic, anything is possible when Barney's around.","popularity":0.257,"poster_path":"/hsmaNYzbJzdE93Lx8hc433fsvG6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68632,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Lyons
