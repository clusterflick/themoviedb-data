Like Kafka’s castle, it guards its secrets well. It is the place of power. The filmmaker, who worked there for several years as a crime reporter, is extremely familiar with its labyrinthine spaces, its practices, its ceremonies. She comes back to it now, while the Courthouse, such as she knows it, is about to disappear: its relocation is planned in 2017. So, she explores it, camera in hand, on the traces of her experience.","popularity":0.325,"poster_path":"/bwbSirdrn1el7ArVxBGxRzZM5qB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80400,"logo_path":"/AtBFbFfYlWo4afoQ4P0ICZXk1H0.png","name":"Elefant Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'Ici","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6999 Doors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289610,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie Pomme Carteret","original_name":"Marie Pomme Carteret","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7d20966ae4d00420d89b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yamina Zoutat","original_name":"Yamina Zoutat","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58db964392514133a500a658","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yamina Zoutat","original_name":"Yamina Zoutat","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1c51ccc3a368491101fc44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2060992,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irène Challand","original_name":"Irène Challand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1c51e69251414ba8017ad3","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56244,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Copans","original_name":"Richard Copans","popularity":0.1466,"profile_path":"/c6zkFdzQW6mQdYDMTdUVO1BVC2k.jpg","credit_id":"5b1c51f4c3a36848f60299df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517027,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Iordachescu","original_name":"Alexandre Iordachescu","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1c52059251414bd701add7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaspard Lamunière","original_name":"Gaspard Lamunière","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1c52189251414bbb026952","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2060993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérôme Vittoz","original_name":"Jérôme Vittoz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2aYHN0aWAMMOj6hiyAOx0YtwBX.jpg","credit_id":"5b1c52719251414b8e024243","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2060994,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandra Pocquet","original_name":"Alexandra Pocquet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1c52829251414bd401fbc8","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339025,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Boris Rabusseau","original_name":"Boris Rabusseau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1c5295c3a368491302204c","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295255,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Séchaud","original_name":"Denis Séchaud","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/whhcxP5esvo88FM80QT6qgvK2eR.jpg","credit_id":"67abcb2df71a3783e1bb3e15","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6697612","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2025,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vaukllpdXSjqwxq1ngKVhW3zCBz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2025,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3FG8pedMt4el3qNGoa0mqjPQhv2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/bwbSirdrn1el7ArVxBGxRzZM5qB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.734,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/486HwrXv33AXLSbOPjLLGamM5Dk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":734}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10859,"name":"tribunal"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
