Their vigilance and resourcefulness are no match for the locked doors, barred windows and the snowstorm that, by causing a power outage, deprives them of light and heat. Worried, frozen, hungry, they confront each other, support each other, console each other in order to overcome their fear. More than courage, it is the discovery of solidarity that will allow them to emerge stronger from this journey to the end of the night.","popularity":0.4298,"poster_path":"/35WkuGUMPiINhu0gV0Wq4HqdPI1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cléo
