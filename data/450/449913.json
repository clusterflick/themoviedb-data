They live somewhat “outside” time, a mode of extra-temporal existence, waiting for the day on which they will be freed from their suffering. It is the people — almost ghosts having survived the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenians and Azerbaijani that has lasted for almost twenty years — that the filmmaker shows and listens to in his film. Behind them, behind their wandering bodies, behind their frenzies, is what remains of the collapse of the Soviet Union in Caucasus: ruins, uninhabited spaces, tombs, vestiges of war, trenches where soldiers watch for an invisible enemy.","popularity":0.2326,"poster_path":"/wklAFv3bO6E2vXeQl7kzXCiz63V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34915,"logo_path":"/l6m94DWgm7BZr1wuYYA7fqSmCBw.png","name":"Zeugma Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":37535,"logo_path":"/vzNk435QC1zSA7DQHUV8v3QXygD.png","name":"Cobra Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eternals","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Yves Vandeweerd","original_name":"Pierre-Yves Vandeweerd","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/6YNkJwS9p2asVkZg4fmWCTdyLOM.jpg","credit_id":"58de4397c3a3687c7d00a93c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894950,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Luc Fichefet","original_name":"Jean-Luc Fichefet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ca45ba92514123b900986f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Yves Vandeweerd","original_name":"Pierre-Yves Vandeweerd","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/6YNkJwS9p2asVkZg4fmWCTdyLOM.jpg","credit_id":"59cfa0be9251412f3f01e2ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Yves Vandeweerd","original_name":"Pierre-Yves Vandeweerd","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/6YNkJwS9p2asVkZg4fmWCTdyLOM.jpg","credit_id":"59cfa0c6c3a3681ddf01bcff","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018687,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Boucq","original_name":"Philippe Boucq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c62c5709251413ddafa16ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894951,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Skelton","original_name":"Richard Skelton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c62c593c3a3684fabd7c13c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6849036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jIfPLloXelmSr9aBH0So50N5hww.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wklAFv3bO6E2vXeQl7kzXCiz63V.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":672},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7Sa2Z8clNyJAkAIb27jQ2wCOaiF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ydPD74utJwgYJ3sf8lO3ykE36V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
