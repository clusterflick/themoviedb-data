It’s a story closely tied to a love of gardens and a desire to preserve nature in a rapidly urbanizing nation. Travelling to studios, gardens and iconic locations throughout the United States, UK and France, this mesmerising film is a feast for the eyes.  The Artist’s Garden: American Impressionism features the sell-out exhibition The Artist’s Garden: American Impressionism and the Garden Movement, 1887–1920 that began at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and ended at the Florence Griswold Museum, Old Lyme, Connecticut.","popularity":1.2906,"poster_path":"/cFyNr01GnbbQtuYh1Tn5cRdvYX6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Their art defied the critics, their story defined a nation.","title":"The Artist’s Garden: American Impressionism","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Exhibition on Screen: The Artist’s Garden - American Impressionism","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"EOS: The Artist’s Garden - American Impressionism","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Anderson","original_name":"Gillian Anderson","popularity":3.4912,"profile_path":"/60fOJNhmfEmyskQDmHStSMHRjgK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58d7b1dbc3a368127c0534c8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d7b230c3a368127c053522","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6865966","wikidata_id":"Q29787372","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o4ud4K7wQgWXYfnGsccNzHVW9eG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":2397,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cFyNr01GnbbQtuYh1Tn5cRdvYX6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1628},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bCJbOYUIEYQTCzaXHaqq4PNbvEP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/cmsAGQebzBocjtVKNldCTVcnNGg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1102,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/tuKy24wXhawLYHeD2Um68YDOTiZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":734}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":904,"name":"pennsylvania, usa"},{"id":2105,"name":"garden"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":2936,"name":"artists' life"},{"id":6018,"name":"new hampshire"},{"id":6981,"name":"connecticut"},{"id":11004,"name":"rural area"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":40984,"name":"exhibition"},{"id":159521,"name":"claude monet"},{"id":193723,"name":"art museum"},{"id":231803,"name":"impressionism"},{"id":234005,"name":"giverny"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
