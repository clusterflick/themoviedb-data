True to her love of spectacle and self-parody, the show began with a drag queen impersonating Cher in her iconic Take Me Home album outfit, lip-syncing the titular disco hit. Just as the audience embraced the illusion, the real Cher appeared—not as herself, but as Laverne, her brash housewife character from her '70s TV show. This unexpected, campy juxtaposition was pure Cher: audacious, hilarious, and clever. The “real” Cher emerged only after this self-referential intro, highlighting her playful awareness of her larger-than-life persona. The opening set the tone for a tour brimming with theatricality and charm. In one climactic moment, Cher soared above the stage, carried by dancers as the audience’s ecstatic cheers cemented her dominance as a live performer. Decades later, the footage retains its magic, a testament to Cher’s ability to captivate like no one else.","popularity":0.9981,"poster_path":"/54jL1MnMafbBiv7J3mY3c76XL9Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"aka Live in Monte Carlo","title":"Standing Room Only: Cher in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Live in Monte Carlo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cher","original_name":"Cher","popularity":1.5126,"profile_path":"/yDglV70XMu2cBWZigp5Jxd4etfv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677860b9313383d2ad725eba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Sacha","original_name":"Kenny Sacha","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bette Midler","credit_id":"6778628038d26a2a63726862","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.C.
