Directed and edited by 16-year-old Irish filmmaker Sol Stuart, this thought-provoking film sheds light on the science behind digital addiction and its effects on mental health, productivity, and social relationships.  Blending scientific research with personal perspectives, Stuart interviews fellow student Colm Prole, who shares his insights and opinions on the growing influence of technology in modern life. Through candid discussions and careful analysis, the documentary challenges viewers to reflect on their own digital habits and consider healthier approaches to technology use.  Created as an entry for the 2024 Trócaire Right Focus Competition, Disconnected earned a well-deserved third place, showcasing Stuart’s talent as a rising filmmaker and his commitment to addressing urgent social issues.","popularity":0.2155,"poster_path":"/rRCRHWBTQvq6b8FfAYLkh58hQLd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solflix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2024-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disconnected","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5155638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Stuart","original_name":"Sol Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n8F5IPw8EqprSi0DCEDxDRoy7ry.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sol Stuart","credit_id":"67778eeeb55ff939be668b45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5155646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colm Prole","original_name":"Colm Prole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Colm Prole","credit_id":"67778f031a2df59ad3749112","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5155638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Stuart","original_name":"Sol Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n8F5IPw8EqprSi0DCEDxDRoy7ry.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"677793ce6d7ca00e78724f81","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5155646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colm Prole","original_name":"Colm Prole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"677793e125e0e91c57749412","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5155638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Stuart","original_name":"Sol Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n8F5IPw8EqprSi0DCEDxDRoy7ry.jpg","credit_id":"67778e746d7ca00e78724edb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5155638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Stuart","original_name":"Sol Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n8F5IPw8EqprSi0DCEDxDRoy7ry.jpg","credit_id":"67778e871a2df59ad37490d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5155638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Stuart","original_name":"Sol Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n8F5IPw8EqprSi0DCEDxDRoy7ry.jpg","credit_id":"677792e9c11ee61dd874943a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5155638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Stuart","original_name":"Sol Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n8F5IPw8EqprSi0DCEDxDRoy7ry.jpg","credit_id":"677792ff82cce15a767499f6","department":"Sound","job":"Audio Post Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5155643,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Filip Bochenek","original_name":"Filip Bochenek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779e194a6def0111a74869d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5155643,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Filip Bochenek","original_name":"Filip Bochenek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779e1c04bf0f0e3b474892e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wW6wKmJiCxKQ32Pah3u5ZtgQWmp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1806}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1924,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rRCRHWBTQvq6b8FfAYLkh58hQLd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1283}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":176834,"name":"social media"},{"id":281585,"name":"inspirational"},{"id":286450,"name":"dopamine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Disconnected  - The Right Focus 2024","key":"VhXsFNeSgao","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-18T15:00:06.000Z","id":"6777995a313383d2ad724ec4"}]}}}
