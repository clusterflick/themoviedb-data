Spanning Wales, Uganda and Germany, this episode sees vegan chef, permaculture enthusiast, and YouTuber Gaz Oakley meet permaculture expert Bemeriki Dusabe, a Congolese refugee who has been living in a settlement in Uganda for the last 16 years, where he has set up a foundation teaching others how to grow their food - a testament to the incredible strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A poignant film about self-sufficiency, growth, community and connection.","popularity":0.2078,"poster_path":"/acYxNS2m28rDbBsQY65lTladUjt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196787,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lief","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Permaculturist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5155863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bemeriki Bisimwa Dusabe","original_name":"Bemeriki Bisimwa Dusabe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6777c39cab5ec4c3dc72556c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3729197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaz Oakley","original_name":"Gaz Oakley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6777c3a482cce15a7674a0a0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2585062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curtis Essel","original_name":"Curtis Essel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6777c36882cce15a7674a054","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margo Mars","original_name":"Margo Mars","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6777c380496dd952c8725203","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1094,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acYxNS2m28rDbBsQY65lTladUjt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":729}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
