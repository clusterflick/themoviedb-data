Passing from day to night, the film shows groups of people loitering on the street and sitting in a café, while images of run-down houses and cars suggest a neglected urban environment. Within this record of ordinary life, the artist brings out the melancholic side of a community which seems to be both drifting along and waiting for something to happen. Nashashibi is interested in how people use the space around them. The film is a companion to ‘Midwest Field’, which shows how the town’s residents spend their time in the green spaces outside the city.\" - NationalGalleries.org","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5ul6t0hAXbDVjJos6e1hYgeddiO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midwest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","original_name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/73XYrrsLlb0lGXcVH7fTjfbVDdR.jpg","credit_id":"6776e3228fd6f5109d723807","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ul6t0hAXbDVjJos6e1hYgeddiO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
