Back in the UK, at Symonds Yat in Monmouthshire, he proudly catches barbel and chub. We then to Italy where Matt finds a variety of carp, and lastly to Spain, where he and his team hook some monstrous catfish. Along the way, we are introduced to a number of European fishing experts and some wacky new baits, and we witness some very exciting moments, most notably Matt's epic struggle with a seven-foot, 150lb catfish.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matt Kayes Lake Escapes - Barbel, Catfish & Carp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
