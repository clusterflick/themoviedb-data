An icon of the 70’s, Robert began his career doing his robot in front of the Hollywood Wax Museum and a few short years later had his own top rated Prime Time CBS Variety show with his beautiful wife Lorene called: “The Shields & Yarnell Show”. And along the way, unbeknownst to him, he created ripples that define an art form to this day.  This film may not save the environment, it won’t take on a corrupt corporation nor will it make you write your congress person. What it will do is make you laugh, bring you wonder and joy and introduce you to a man who makes you believe that anything is possible… including (and don’t try this at home!) Street Skiing in downtown San Francisco!","popularity":0.6111,"poster_path":"/lP0PlkxFxbD807TK9AmuqeEeXYd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Robert Shields: My Life as a Robot” is a documentary that will make you believe that your actions can have an inspirational effect on so many lives - and you may not even be aware of it.","title":"Robert Shields: My Life as a Robot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Shields","original_name":"Robert Shields","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/giWnMAywC9V7oQHvsYx60e9XJgM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786a346d7ca00e78726b78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorene Yarnell Jansson","original_name":"Lorene Yarnell Jansson","popularity":0.1685,"profile_path":"/z2lF5dKvptqslHc9jhSrRBXQ0Uq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786a426d7ca00e78726b8d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Orlando","original_name":"Tony Orlando","popularity":0.3543,"profile_path":"/jlVsMDLeZqqKJNwk1bje1aL6QfV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786a4d321a3a166a74b08d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mac Davis","original_name":"Mac Davis","popularity":0.2228,"profile_path":"/Aep1NIUEUVoO2jxG4pOtWreI4UT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786a586d7ca00e78726b9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Cassidy","original_name":"Joanna Cassidy","popularity":2.0397,"profile_path":"/2GZeohandSt32YHEoDEam1uQHcc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786a896d7ca00e78726bbc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Binder","original_name":"Steve Binder","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/p6mt1xPRz957hckdE0UNYTHv8sD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786ab75ac1bd8261669e05","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chadd Smith","original_name":"Chadd Smith","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786ad99cb089e05166a299","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poppin John","original_name":"Poppin John","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786afd321a3a166a74b0d9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Scudder","original_name":"Billy Scudder","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67786b20496dd952c87270c1","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark C.
