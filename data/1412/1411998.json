The film records the meeting of two artistic worlds: that of the Haida, an indigenous people whose cultural life and mythology bespeak their belief in a tangible link between the real and the imaginary, and that of Frédéric Back, a master of animated film and committed humanist, whose works is an appeal to respect all things created. Through the magic of animation, the documentary casts fresh light on the legends and spirituality of the Haida.","popularity":0.2773,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8117,"logo_path":"/eVsVPEZRK63zsQMxxSHf5Cv017g.png","name":"Max Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vlasta Vrana","original_name":"Vlasta Vrana","popularity":0.3381,"profile_path":"/z5ujCvCkNv7ikka6tJVaxqegldY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"677875668fd6f5109d726426","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5157393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Hart","original_name":"Jim Hart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ptoMOxg4zh1AWvnGfhFOc1B1h1u.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67788047321a3a166a74b447","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5157411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gidansda Guujaaw","original_name":"Gidansda Guujaaw","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67788316830a8f4cc766754b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel P.
