She is fascinated by the forest, the mountains and the clear air that smells of clouds and winter and burns her nose when she breathes it in - for which she is mocked by her classmates. On a trip to a mine, she gets lost in the labyrinth of dark shafts and suddenly emerges on the other side of the mountain. This world is almost identical to the old one - but the characters have been replaced. In the town on the other side, she meets Duc (Tri An Bui), the son of a Vietnamese family who run an Asian snack bar. And while Duc tries to find a balance between his German-Vietnamese heritage and the expectations of others, Trúc Lâm accepts the help of a ghost to find her way back into her world.","popularity":0.4511,"poster_path":"/7PRTs05VGf5KfFjiWrHGR0d0vs5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2025-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lonig & Havendel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5200066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tri An Bui","original_name":"Tri An Bui","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Duc","credit_id":"67936e6e0a30d6d059239280","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015006,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nano Nguyen","original_name":"Nano Nguyen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Truc Lam","credit_id":"67936e8a0a30d6d059239288","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5200068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vy Luu","original_name":"Vy Luu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Cindy","credit_id":"67936e9c5dd2531e8b483ac4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3216752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niklas Wetzel","original_name":"Niklas Wetzel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"67936eb125d2980fb02393c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015045,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jordis Herrmann","original_name":"Jordis Herrmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Melanie","credit_id":"67936eeb3be0b7b6f323895f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5200069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Weinert","original_name":"Denise Weinert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"67936f0ed5f9fe6cfc483b2c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2079917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Long Dang Ngoc","original_name":"Long Dang Ngoc","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Vater Nguyen","credit_id":"67936f28d5f9fe6cfc483b51","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5200070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lan Pham Thi","original_name":"Lan Pham Thi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Mutter Nguyen","credit_id":"67936f4d3be0b7b6f32389a3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5200071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michaela Banert","original_name":"Michaela Banert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Kellnerin Steffi /Steves Cousine","credit_id":"67936f6c7660f09f3f483f2a","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Tuyết Scheffel","original_name":"Claudia Tuyết Scheffel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6776fb009cb089e0516677d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Tuyết Scheffel","original_name":"Claudia Tuyết Scheffel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6776fb0a9cb089e0516677e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5154678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yunus Çağ Köylü","original_name":"Yunus Çağ Köylü","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6776fb221a2df59ad3748411","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4683038,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Niklas Doka","original_name":"Niklas Doka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6776fb369cb089e0516677f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4440245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter M.
