Thus, exercise became a necessity for him, although all his experiences with sports during his childhood were fraught with bullying due to his effeminate behavior. This accident forces him to ask himself: if he had been a heterosexual man, would he have had a good relationship with sports? He asks himself this question in Paris, where he is studying for a master's degree in filmmaking, and, from the solitude of his room and with no production budget, decides to contact Club Muxes, the only LGBTQTQ+ soccer team in Mexico, his country of origin. The conversation takes place over the phone, and the images we see are sent by the club's communications department.","popularity":0.1374,"poster_path":"/dNHJNxs7JgAl2yqY064NlDDubPM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Equus Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-01-29","revenue":100,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le rose, le bleu","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"El rosa, el azul","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5154017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesús - voice","original_name":"Jesús - voice","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jesús","credit_id":"6776953a0a007d8ef0128179","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5154018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin - voice","original_name":"Kevin - voice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kevin","credit_id":"677695451bd56c23e3928e57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5154053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Escamilla","original_name":"Edgar Escamilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"677699bc98f2f82fc492e023","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5154016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Spural","original_name":"Edgar Spural","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Edgar","credit_id":"67769f83bf10ff1984625e35","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5154021,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antoine Bui","original_name":"Antoine Bui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677695816234c1b46f61bbf9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5154016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Spural","original_name":"Edgar Spural","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677698bc0f248e850812fa8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5154016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Spural","original_name":"Edgar Spural","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67769941fbe3722a9861d532","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33501981","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cjwd2RTgaGqR6Z6pc6kNmdfS179.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A9AMn8AyS8UuMI4gVibLZ68KRTu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dNHJNxs7JgAl2yqY064NlDDubPM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1414},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mWII7Twwr7vcv1N5i26rHE5Tfbx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aIFgLKw6W6cvYwA53ol7JmnowdF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qud4vf3BZFKbioWW5qoJLHOy3I9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":281814,"name":"queer and questioning"},{"id":325761,"name":"admiring"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"At the Centre Pompidou for the Hors Pistes Festival under the topic \"Sports rules\"","release_date":"2024-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"At the NEOFEST festival","release_date":"2024-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
