We then travel to Norway where Matt struggles to find the elusive salmon and works hard to improve his new techniques. We join him in West Wales for a spot of sea trout fishing on the River Towy, including some brave night-time ventures. Finally he heads to Ireland, where he catches some fine specimens of brown troat. Surrounded by such a diverse and wonderful range of beautiful landscapes, Matt feels utterly at one with nature - and his amazing catches are a bonus!","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matt Kayes Lake Escapes - Game Fishing and Deep Sea Fishing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
