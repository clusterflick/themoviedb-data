More than a travelogue, Descending the Dragon is a personal look into the heart of this sea-loving nation, its hopeful spirit and unique culture. Driven by his intense curiosity about post-1975 Vietnam and eager to replace the old war images burned in his mind with new ones of today, Bowermaster overcame daunting bureaucratic obstacles and pushed ahead with his expedition. Joining the expedition is Ngan Nguyen, whose family escaped Saigon by helicopter when she was three, on the last day of the war. She grew up in New Orleans speaking Vietnamese and has traveled back to her homeland many times. What she learned about her home country will change her forever.","popularity":0.2764,"poster_path":"/2n4UgeyiBPa16RXTRBrDfwtlUzl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123388,"logo_path":"/fAtGS8zDA5g2Qovf7uwPgiD2zID.png","name":"National Geographic Channels International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Descending the Dragon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bowermaster","original_name":"Jon Bowermaster","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/AkmzNIP8X5C0SSRPXl5M6PxnPgW.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677860e855d4b38f9366a5b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ngan Ngueyn","original_name":"Ngan Ngueyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6778610f25e0e91c5774ac2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Green","original_name":"Polly Green","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6778616fb55ff939be66a2c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Howard","original_name":"Rob Howard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677861c29cb089e05166a0ba","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Getzels","original_name":"Peter Getzels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67785b8c38d26a2a6372663e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Getzels","original_name":"Peter Getzels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67785b95496dd952c8726d23","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157124,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Getzels","original_name":"Peter Getzels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67785ba39cb089e051669f21","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Vecchio","original_name":"Salvatore Vecchio","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67785bbe9cb089e051669f25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157126,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William F.
