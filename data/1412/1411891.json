She's accustomed to being sent to her room or outside whenever her parents entertain new and ever-changing guests. One evening, playing beneath the stars, Grace stumbles upon a hidden room. Inside, she finds a woman, weak and seemingly forgotten, confined in silence. Their brief conversation leaves an indelible mark on Grace. But by the next day, the room is empty, as if the woman-and their encounter-had never existed.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escaping Gravity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellie Gullo","original_name":"Ellie Gullo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"67b255f780270b0e089fc155","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meredith Bolthouse","original_name":"Meredith Bolthouse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Celeste","credit_id":"67b2560085f576e97d6dc9d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rayne Polkowski","original_name":"Rayne Polkowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"67b256097294be98a8e0efbf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5253370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Petersen","original_name":"Ken Petersen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Father","credit_id":"67b3c31f5b8c789e849fc180","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5253369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David J.
