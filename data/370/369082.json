First mounted in 1987, it was a huge success and a live recording of its revival in May 1992, the 200th anniversary of Rossini's birth, has been made.  Fo has said that Rossini is the musician of eating and love. He composes music rich in herbs and aromas, in which you find olives, tomatoes, fish, grapes, roses and rosemary, sheets and tablecloths, dry wine and the laughter of girls. His Barber is a joyful carnival. During the overture he fills the stage with carnival revelers and immediately the commedia dell' arte origins of opera buffa are restored. Visual theatrics abound, never at the expense of the music, but highlighting it, engaging the eye as well as the ear. Fo addresses the heart more than the intellect and Rossini's comedy comes up dazzling and vital.","popularity":0.1927,"poster_path":"/9w6RkcdlrJdEhojCWex7VGZh5Cw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rossini: Il Barbiere Di Siviglia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Croft","original_name":"Richard Croft","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/dh9ujc5SqJrLPJG68cYhb8Apaav.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Almaviva","credit_id":"63c7c7062f3b170085c3f17e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renato Capecchi","original_name":"Renato Capecchi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/o07TfbKIh1lWjIEsmeALenDTywy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bartolo","credit_id":"63c7c14c70b44400c8be877b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Larmore","original_name":"Jennifer Larmore","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/ApUQIPKWQiQMi9jbc6zxbndJJTC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rosina","credit_id":"63c7c17070b444008743829d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davis Malis","original_name":"Davis Malis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/z9oQnZKIJ13aqt5aaGOWATq2xcT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Figaro","credit_id":"63c7c187142ef100dacf71ec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Alaimo","original_name":"Simone Alaimo","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/vxJFTJZNXKNE6U7me4tyat063e.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Basilio","credit_id":"63c7c1dac5c1ef00cb1c651d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1880778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Smeets","original_name":"Roger Smeets","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fiorello","credit_id":"63c7c221abdec000c87f4925","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonie Schoon","original_name":"Leonie Schoon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Berta","credit_id":"63c7c1f92f3b1700937f8912","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cesare Sterbini","original_name":"Cesare Sterbini","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/jJag7UxUIn4sUN6QdYe8iP2ABEN.jpg","credit_id":"63c7c43d7a97ab00b6711006","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1299323,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais","original_name":"Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/8gvxHDn9aqMpZl3CRNFOebit68l.jpg","credit_id":"63c7c466abdec000c87f4a88","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gioacchino Rossini","original_name":"Gioacchino Rossini","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/rEOcvlxwKQlOgFpzLPp0Qw6Ig7n.jpg","credit_id":"63c7c49e2f3b1700baaa84ad","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787741,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alberto Zedda","original_name":"Alberto Zedda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c7c2bf70b44400aecd1e47","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231231","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9w6RkcdlrJdEhojCWex7VGZh5Cw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
