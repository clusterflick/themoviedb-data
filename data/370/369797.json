It was taped on December 18, 2011 at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, and aired the next evening on VH1, paying tribute to the places that helped create or contributed to soul music: Chicago, Detroit, London, Philadelphia and Memphis.  Anita Baker, who was going to sing with Jill Scott, had to drop out moments before the concert after disagreements with producers, allowing Marsha Ambrosius and Ledisi to step in and perform in their places during the Detroit medley.  Kelly Clarkson twisted her ankle on the way into the concert, though she still performed as planned.","popularity":1.3514,"poster_path":"/beCoPEVULFFmDMGiUNBvTq4CwS0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VH1 Divas Celebrates Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1215553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Baker","original_name":"Anita Baker","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"669f5a581749839bf88f21e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erykah Badu","original_name":"Erykah Badu","popularity":0.4194,"profile_path":"/zg3J3Tt4q7dhFZ6SuszvwuuFp1g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"669f5a7db5a43cba802e77af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary J.
