Only with exquisite machines--spacecraft in orbit and powerful computers on the ground--can humanity begin to uncover the elegant nature of our complex home.  Presented here are a collection of data visualizations based on observations gathered by a fleet of spacecraft. In various depictions we see the currents of the world's oceans, changes in temperature and land cover over time, and precipitation as it cycles energy and water around our living planet.  But The Earth is only one part of a dynamic sphere, and with its companion The Moon nearby, we cannot hlep but remeber that our whole planet travels in a wider ocean. This video presents Earth's Moon with data gathered by the remarkable Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, an advanced probe designed to map our planetary companion in unprecedented detail.","popularity":0.2607,"poster_path":"/cd79e7ticO6mwUN3oYHwfXpln7Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48698,"logo_path":"/g93vV2z8Oh6xoTU3VJGBotsc02N.png","name":"NASA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Synthesis: NASA Data Visualizations","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Synthesis NASA Data Visualisation 2015","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cd79e7ticO6mwUN3oYHwfXpln7Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4627,"name":"earth"},{"id":9882,"name":"space"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
