Hokkaido. Edmonton. Revelstoke. Haines. Queenstown. Stubai Glacier. Many have passed through these places over the last two years; workers, travelers, adventurers…among them was a collection of friends bonded by a shared affinity for chasing snow to all corners of the globe. This group of skiers has come to be known as Legs of Steel, and they’ve been travel companions for a long time.  From their last two seasons of travel, through dedicated production comes a new film, Passenger.  A cinematic journey that spans four continents, the film aims to reveal the endless spectrum of emotions and experiences from each location. With the help of Old Man Winter himself, a story is woven through the twists and turns of a season, shedding light on how it feels to be a constant passenger.","popularity":0.2024,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"ski freeski","title":"Legs of Steel PASSENGER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2006,"name":"extreme sports"},{"id":1262,"name":"mountain"},{"id":195732,"name":"ski"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
