Álvaro Domecq Romero evokes the last days of the life of the mare \"Splendid\", the noble animal that was brave and sensitive companion of his father. Andrés Vázquez tells how the times of the \"capeas\" were in little villages. With him were many unknown kids, who found an anonymous and obscure death. Finally, Luis Miguel \"Dominguín\", who was with Manolete, in Linares, the afternoon in which he met his death, evokes that tragic afternoon and glosses the bullfighter's human virtues. The four protagonists have seen the death in one way or another and the four tell the indelible impression that remained on them.","popularity":0.1958,"poster_path":"/rS9jULhaB39bi6V2dSo1w9Xi2u3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68219,"logo_path":null,"name":"Memsa (Moreno-Espert-Moreno S.A.)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1967-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yo he visto a la muerte","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1067175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Bienvenida","original_name":"Antonio Bienvenida","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/wCFTV2As40QAlWWmIEL4z7ugXdI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"564da3369251414dcb00a43c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álvaro Domecq Romero","original_name":"Álvaro Domecq Romero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"564da3d0c3a368602400b35c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Miguel Dominguín","original_name":"Luis Miguel Dominguín","popularity":0.1701,"profile_path":"/jyKQKPXU4Rtnb81yGH8gaT7QOIl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"564da3dac3a368602400b364","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Gandía","original_name":"Antonio Gandía","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"564da3e5925141594d004b5b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaime de Armiñán","original_name":"Jaime de Armiñán","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/9NkuzE1sSF9Bsi4zSeOtnyydUwS.jpg","credit_id":"564da32b9251416de30068ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José María Forqué","original_name":"José María Forqué","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/yyAOtfNlDtLAmg2FY7gs8beisov.jpg","credit_id":"564da2dac3a3686035009e91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaime de Armiñán","original_name":"Jaime de Armiñán","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/9NkuzE1sSF9Bsi4zSeOtnyydUwS.jpg","credit_id":"564da31a9251414dcb00a435","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0059928","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/goKtSCUAC4Zw2NqbI2dZ2YvFXyf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rS9jULhaB39bi6V2dSo1w9Xi2u3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215286,"name":"toros"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
