Various young people are interviewed about their situation and their search for jobs and accommodation. Highlights the frustrations they face and the resultant temptation to fall into crime and prostitution in order to survive. Police and social workers who deal with these young people from day to day comment on the situation and how they attempt to alleviate the despair of those they encounter. Use of voice-overs (street kids talking about their lives) is very effective as well as disturbing. A courageous and compelling documentary.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Street Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leigh Tilson","original_name":"Leigh Tilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564c8025c3a3686028006fff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Scott","original_name":"Rob Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564c8039c3a3686024007693","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
