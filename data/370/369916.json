Darren, a high school outcast whose only refuge is his homemade comic book, gets launched into an adventure way cooler than anything he could dream up when he discovers his best friend has no biological need for sleep and can bring their dreams into reality.  Composed of equal parts action, humour, and heart, this story of a comic book fan who finds himself in a real-life superhero movie will make audiences believe that anything is possible.","popularity":0.7823,"poster_path":"/oQUyOVhGpWsaPHqZfKM2eFeoak8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boy Who Couldn't Sleep and Never Had To","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Quaid","original_name":"Jack Quaid","popularity":5.2829,"profile_path":"/320qW5yEbxpmyxQ3evmClJbtKag.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Darren","credit_id":"58b4bec3c3a3685f1e0021b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Revolori","original_name":"Tony Revolori","popularity":0.779,"profile_path":"/tSF6XmXDikrKZbFUeoDnafXxKjT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eric","credit_id":"58b4becdc3a3685f1e0021c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1766803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Blakeslee","original_name":"Jennifer Blakeslee","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/tM75hoVjXETGsW7lTMwLf9iuCIT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Operative","credit_id":"58b4bed9c3a3685f2c00217c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Burke","original_name":"Gregory Burke","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gun Scientist","credit_id":"58b4bee69251410a8c002419","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696390,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Nania","original_name":"John Nania","popularity":0.3338,"profile_path":"/2CzFwb95Aj7g2tYZqFA6UzTPoqm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Warrior","credit_id":"58b4bef0c3a3685edf002162","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Eckman","original_name":"Jeff Eckman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Warrior (Double)","credit_id":"58b4befbc3a3685edf002175","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Eckman","original_name":"Dan Eckman","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/3Z4C0EN107wvpUhtezXj7fGBwb7.jpg","credit_id":"565521469251410191000a52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":120573,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Meggie McFadden","original_name":"Meggie McFadden","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5655215e9251410188000a2d","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.C.
