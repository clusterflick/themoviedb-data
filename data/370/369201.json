The film tells about the fate of four wolf cubs left without a mother. How their character is formed and skills are acquired. How, by instinct, wolf cubs learn to hunt and survive in the wild, where they have many enemies. The cubs have learned the first lesson that life in a pack is much more reliable than alone. In the course of the film, we follow their short but courageous lives. Our heroes have grown up, but the main law of the wild nature - the war for territory, has become the most difficult for them.","popularity":0.4446,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf Law","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1994,"name":"wolf"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":232116,"name":"wolves"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
