This is not entirely correct, because they are friends, anyway, and always have been. They play cards together and go to each others’ birthday parties, have wives and children and probably mortgages.

Either that or it’s a home movie, shot with a video camera, to an improvised script or no script at all.","popularity":0.2055,"poster_path":"/obuvxmccvyOyz6HbnDljctygrtk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223,"logo_path":"/pdthRbCuXNlrGNwnmLFRxv5Zy3t.png","name":"Les Films du
