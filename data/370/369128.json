It includes excerpts from many of his films, and interviews with second wife Ann and biographer Roger Horrocks. Len Lye himself is often heard, outlining his ideas of the ‘old brain’ and how Māori and Aboriginal art influenced his work. The grandeur of his ideas are only matched by their scale, with steel sculptures designed to be \"at least 20 foot high\".","popularity":0.1865,"poster_path":"/A0M7tE19Bw1Ga9Mk1gIcw4oMa60.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Koninck Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doodlin': Impressions Of Len Lye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Len Lye","original_name":"Len Lye","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/rGNL1Bzvje4x7wWxtapS3en2NVO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cfc0574d67910139ee8f84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4200778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Lye","original_name":"Ann Lye","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cfc06185090f010691be16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cfc06b303c850100b137ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096254,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Barnes","original_name":"Paul Barnes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cfc12d6d4c97014f42954d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357280,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roger Horrocks","original_name":"Roger Horrocks","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/rw9dYbZ5Cv8PCdaai8yGOnzsIOA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cfc4786d4c97012e8b5757","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Griffiths","original_name":"Keith Griffiths","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/o8L1E5SnGVsSVuwIv5m5WotVUQL.jpg","credit_id":"564c9e6ec3a3682a1a002175","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6428,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arpad Bondy","original_name":"Arpad Bondy","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfc495549dda011c285088","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Griffiths","original_name":"Keith Griffiths","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/o8L1E5SnGVsSVuwIv5m5WotVUQL.jpg","credit_id":"64cfc4c64d679100acf0dfaa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553162,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nigel Edwards","original_name":"Nigel Edwards","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfc4b06d4c97012e8b576f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33302,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Bluck","original_name":"Richard Bluck","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfc4876d4c9700ec57fc19","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4200845,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ali Duffey","original_name":"Ali Duffey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfc4a04d67910139ee913b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410871,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Larry Sider","original_name":"Larry Sider","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfc4d7303c8500e338fcc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0340674","wikidata_id":"Q123288692","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A0M7tE19Bw1Ga9Mk1gIcw4oMa60.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hNRlMHPocHVbB1I31HOEZX4Dvwe.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
