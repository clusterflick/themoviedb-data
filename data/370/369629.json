In the village, however, Anna has been hostile for quite some time. The reason: It defies the plans of the municipal council to open up the region for mass tourism. In the charming Johannes Wallner Anna first thinks she has found an ally - until she discovers that he is actually working for the unscrupulous tourist group. Only through the love of Anna does Johannes begin to question the plans of his clients.","popularity":0.3448,"poster_path":"/rxJ65yMpC6VzaVuFwD8EnvRwMId.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Tal des Schweigens","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Neubauer","original_name":"Christine Neubauer","popularity":0.572,"profile_path":"/jk8UUqjCmfda7wsbJw50YM0Vfd9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anna Christeiner","credit_id":"5652103f9251414b0a00b810","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sascha Hehn","original_name":"Sascha Hehn","popularity":0.3197,"profile_path":"/9TcZJbtJxaBOowuMmEluECTJAar.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Johannes Wallner","credit_id":"565211b19251414af900b2b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronika Fitz","original_name":"Veronika Fitz","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/dc4TXxjXONgN7BWC6cDutBsBO7d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zensi Christeiner","credit_id":"565211a2925141645f007d10","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Peach","original_name":"Timothy Peach","popularity":0.1661,"profile_path":"/og3ImGqoxz2s8ljpYRo7eaZ9bpW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Markus Wallner","credit_id":"565211e19251414af900b2b8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronja Forcher","original_name":"Ronja Forcher","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/6rDRVFbEcnIppw2hQhWNQktxeCf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elise Christeiner","credit_id":"565211f49251414b0a00b851","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Held","original_name":"Alexander Held","popularity":0.4981,"profile_path":"/zE9NoMX4657qMX52EMFah9pHYSI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stadlhuber","credit_id":"5652121d925141645f007d22","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1539486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Froschauer","original_name":"Franz Froschauer","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Penzinger","credit_id":"5652123c92514112390027eb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sämann","original_name":"Peter Sämann","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5652101ac3a368070d00b8ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1240193","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhZaQAamtqewDbYAMKX1737q7MZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1614,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rxJ65yMpC6VzaVuFwD8EnvRwMId.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1262,"name":"mountain"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
