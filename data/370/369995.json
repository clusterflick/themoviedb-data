To stop them, the American agent must masquerade as a smuggler and join the gang. Meanwhile a young revolutionary is captivated by the brave words of her leader and pretends to be a singer while she looks for smugglers to sell her the weapons her group so badly needs. The agent is doing well until the smuggler he impersonates shows up and blows his cover. Fortunately, the authorities arrive before the agent is killed.","popularity":0.974,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Toughest Man Alive","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dane Clark","original_name":"Dane Clark","popularity":0.4492,"profile_path":"/SJ5xuhll3lGfSRZaB8ZdLSmPvs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lee Stevens","credit_id":"63661d259653f6009141517b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":176873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lita Milan","original_name":"Lita Milan","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/3XLWyTpZJxTXwST6zfVJ4R0F7Nu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lida Velasco","credit_id":"63661d30e004a6007e8266ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Caruso","original_name":"Anthony Caruso","popularity":0.7058,"profile_path":"/8eDPQrngmyQW8NrNbZ9oOfOM9ti.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pete Gore","credit_id":"63661d41e004a6007e8266bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Elliott","original_name":"Ross Elliott","popularity":0.2941,"profile_path":"/f7IMm8AhhbYauIqm1KEr4IHfZCu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Security Agent Cal York","credit_id":"63661d510d2f530091998294","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrna Dell","original_name":"Myrna Dell","popularity":0.1859,"profile_path":"/qzAmIJL3jh24x29HfQAJPd6dLrt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nancy","credit_id":"63661d61d7107e008d779190","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Browne Henry","original_name":"Thomas Browne Henry","popularity":0.2369,"profile_path":"/wnTeUTLHbYxPV3DpVeRzinHzfXg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dolphin","credit_id":"63661d6f0d2f5300919982a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":116989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Levitt","original_name":"Paul Levitt","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Don","credit_id":"63661d7d22af3e0089ef0064","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Eldredge","original_name":"John Eldredge","popularity":0.2512,"profile_path":"/4h1JgoOD9sHGYvRa6SNw4twxdIv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ingo Widner","credit_id":"63661d8a22af3e0089ef006a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dehl Berti","original_name":"Dehl Berti","popularity":0.2527,"profile_path":"/m5ROSGIGWJGRlRQE2dOnVsEJiaM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Salvador","credit_id":"63661d99d8d329008271d1a3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Seymour","original_name":"Jonathan Seymour","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Chief","credit_id":"63661da4350398007acc6a70","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidney Salkow","original_name":"Sidney Salkow","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63661cecbd588b00908289a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0048741","wikidata_id":"Q42048526","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
