The hall boy shows him to his room, puts down his grips, and then disappears through the ceiling. Drummer pushes button five times for a drink, and waiter appears through the floor. Drummer turns to sit down on the bed it disappears. He fights with the waiter, is overcome, and waiter locks him in a trunk and sits on it. After a while he opens the trunk; behold, it's empty. Drummer appears mysteriously, picks up a big book, hits waiter on head, and drives him through the floor. Drummer dances in delirious glee.","popularity":0.0963,"poster_path":"/2jYxMHOTN25H4RFMIN0gtlIiYOH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1899-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Adventure of New York Drummer","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James H.
