All suspects in crimes that strongly shook the nation - Shoko Asahara from the 1995 Aum Tokyo subway gas attacks, Masumi Hayashi from the “poisoned curry” murder case in Wakayama, an unnamed minor from the murder case of a mother and her child in the city of Hikari - have all been sentenced to death.  64-year-old Yoshihiro Yasuda is a lawyer who defends the ‘undefendable’: the death row convicts in court, while suffering slander from the Japanese public and media.  This documentary analyzes a number of death-row cases in Japan, and attitudes towards the accused and to the death penalty itself.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/iJvWmZ48hZzwZT9qQNc0GEYwv0F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Defender of Death-row Convicts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2670371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun'ichi Saito","original_name":"Jun'ichi Saito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e6e2f71bf26600602d7f03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iJvWmZ48hZzwZT9qQNc0GEYwv0F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
