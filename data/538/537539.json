For one New York firefighter, Don Eichin, water has not only acted as his weapon of safety, but also a source of recreation. In New York, a strong community of surfers dwell underneath the ashes and uniforms. These warriors have risen about sea-level to conquer fire, as well as submerge themselves to dominate water. The only element stronger than their honor and skill is the bond of their brotherhood.","popularity":0.1272,"poster_path":"/5jG1gJeHjilcfYJAjJetJ4zEqJQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fire and Water","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Eichin","original_name":"Don Eichin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b5674459251416dd1026419","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Machado","original_name":"Rob Machado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b56745c9251416dc202777d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1516986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janek Ambros","original_name":"Janek Ambros","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/1Uzg58n1T0UnG2N15n5f0NvFvhA.jpg","credit_id":"63b7b10324b33300931b96ec","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas W.
