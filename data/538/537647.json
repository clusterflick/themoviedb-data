In 1961, 5 women died from drinking poisoned wine in a small village gathering in Nabari City in Mie Prefecture. After his arrest, he appealed his innocence on the grounds that the police coerced his confession. He was found not guilty in the first trial. However, it was overturned and he received a death sentence in the second trial, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1972. Since then, Okunishi has continuously appealed for retrial, fighting against the horror of capital punishment.  This TV dramatization of the Nabari Poisoned Wine Case depicts Okunishi in an isolated cell, his mother’s unwavering belief in his innocence, and the effort of people who have rallied to Okunishi’s defense.","popularity":0.3778,"poster_path":"/tsH9NYgd16LOlwslvXLTnLol3Xs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Promise: The Nabari Poisoned Wine Case, The Life of a Death-row Inmate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinobu Terajima","original_name":"寺島しのぶ","popularity":1.7311,"profile_path":"/tOk9ggHemFL5FCvhfYeIkyS3Fk9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"611f4ed72dc44e002c48d7ca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuya Nakadai","original_name":"仲代達矢","popularity":0.6795,"profile_path":"/4LygOe0vFQplLIft5IUWI5OewPX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"611f4f37ac4161005cdebaa5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirin Kiki","original_name":"樹木希林","popularity":0.8554,"profile_path":"/oYLAHVS8BbPRhM2InVob8yWFZQn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"611f4f4d54a8ac002b4d6cc3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shizuo Amano","original_name":"Shizuo Amano","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"611f4f732e06970073574f94","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taro Yamamoto","original_name":"山本太郎","popularity":0.5793,"profile_path":"/1cxXOgY8Z12La1jf0b9BVKgMCjM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"611f4fafd1a893005c2b7194","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2670371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun'ichi Saito","original_name":"Jun'ichi Saito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611f4e972dc44e005c672a74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2670371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun'ichi Saito","original_name":"Jun'ichi Saito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611f4efe9f0e190044105892","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2714902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1682,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tsH9NYgd16LOlwslvXLTnLol3Xs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
