They documented the activities at a huge construction site, street life in Hellâ€™s Kitchen, New York harbor traffic, and rare glimpses of nature. Then the footage was left unedited. In 2017 Kirchheimer (DISCOVERY IN A PAINTING, TALL: THE AMERICAN SKYSCRAPER AND LOUIS SULLIVAN, STATIONS OF THE ELEVATED) took up the challenge of editing it. Once the picture was set he searched for music and sound effects that would mesh with the surrealism of the material. The result is a dynamic and compact symphony of a city.","popularity":0.0569,"poster_path":"/wleKA461dJAoVgurrfAgjE0v6rq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream of a City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"5bb97177c3a368241b01f8bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gM90y7rsWVApF2cYgSUfWkoiYCL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1238,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wleKA461dJAoVgurrfAgjE0v6rq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":826}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
