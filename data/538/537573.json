Despite their age and the world of rapid change, they try to comply with the rule set over ten centuries ago ‘ORA et LABORA’ each day. Our protagonists – nuns Anuncjata and Benedykta (40 years in convent) – introduce us to the world behind the wall telling us about their lives and decisions in a specific way. They show us the world of convent in true colours, without stereotypes, often touching and amusing at the same time. This is the film about silence said aloud.","popularity":0.1563,"poster_path":"/xlpny0WmFzhjFSln6j0g3WfNmNk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Сёстры","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374888,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcin Wojciechowski","original_name":"Marcin Wojciechowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6552957c903c5200ac6d26ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1873161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michał Hytroś","original_name":"Michał Hytroś","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/ueYe8BqcDJ04wOXvkejCpK7h7tU.jpg","credit_id":"5b56a192c3a3685c8803151a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1873161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michał Hytroś","original_name":"Michał Hytroś","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/ueYe8BqcDJ04wOXvkejCpK7h7tU.jpg","credit_id":"5b699fd5c3a3685375066ab9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808225,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bogdan Klat","original_name":"Bogdan Klat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b69a024c3a36818970ece78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101619,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Janusz Szymański","original_name":"Janusz Szymański","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b699fe3c3a368189d0eb1a7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8630068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iBdtNVKjpIwSnNYxqaClQk76plM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/xlpny0WmFzhjFSln6j0g3WfNmNk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":523},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a8H4J3rdmC3F61NsUa5zxSmVClK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wrS7SgaennGTXsmZjUID59S2zbd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Koszalinski Festiwal Debiutów Filmowych 'Mlodzi i Film'","release_date":"2018-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
