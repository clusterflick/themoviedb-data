She was one of the greatest American photographers of the 20th Century. From her portraits of the avant-garde taken in Paris during the 1920's, to her documentation of New York in the 1930's, to her science photography of the 1950s, and her studies of small-town America, Abbott's genius is in the incredible range of her work. Filmed during her 91st and 92nd years, the open-hearted Abbott takes us on a guided tour of her century. The tour teaches history, perseverance, courage, and single-minded dedication to one's chosen field. A brilliant film about a brilliant American artist!","popularity":0.0834,"poster_path":"/jxutJqdSJrt4AtPn3W1V5aK6vfm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106934,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ishtar Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berenice Abbott: A View of the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berenice Abbott","original_name":"Berenice Abbott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b55483f0e0a2673d600e1c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kay Weaver","original_name":"Kay Weaver","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b55484fc3a3685c9700ded8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Wheelock","original_name":"Martha Wheelock","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b554859c3a3685c8b00d438","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kay Weaver","original_name":"Kay Weaver","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5548610e0a2673cd00d889","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Wheelock","original_name":"Martha Wheelock","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5548699251416dda00c38a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Wheelock","original_name":"Martha Wheelock","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5548700e0a2673cf00dcd9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4172734","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxutJqdSJrt4AtPn3W1V5aK6vfm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Los Angeles","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
