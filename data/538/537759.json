Settling into this interstitial expanse of Shirin Neshat’s Soliloquy (1999), viewers become mediators, with the series of scenes on each screen flowing not past, but through this audience – asking them, perhaps, to act as witnesses to the ensuing visual dialogue. The titles begin, in English and Persian; then, the sole character appears, clad in black robes and played by Neshat herself. She is looking out of two different windows: one in Albany, New York; the other in Mardin, Turkey, not far from the artist’s native Iran.","popularity":0.1312,"poster_path":"/7sr1LiZPKy83uLq5rkZnlJ6Ym7S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soliloquy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirin Neshat","original_name":"Shirin Neshat","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/st1h4deZVh1HWBIdynagR445zdK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef0dabc283ed900368e444d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirin Neshat","original_name":"Shirin Neshat","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/st1h4deZVh1HWBIdynagR445zdK.jpg","credit_id":"5b57ca249251416dc603faa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0963949","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7sr1LiZPKy83uLq5rkZnlJ6Ym7S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
