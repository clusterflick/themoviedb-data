Lock filmed the achievements and daily rituals of his fellow communards, his camera bearing witness as a community assembled and dispersed. The resulting film uses poetic strategies, including logograms and other graphic disruptions, to extend its themes of renewal and rebirth, and to mark the encounter between reason and imagination, the concrete and the abstract. A landmark work of Canadian underground cinema, a film diary with mystic and symbolic overtones.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/vV848W8VGPvNvIFHeMouyEMNTZC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Everywhere Again Alive","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Lock","original_name":"Keith Lock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b560d560e0a2673cd01fab8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0250367","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vV848W8VGPvNvIFHeMouyEMNTZC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ea1fsLuoxk15Dvxcb0EwmyA4Wee.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4rXtfb2zZR4m1fUP3NQptBPcrjt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything Everywhere Again Alive - Excerpt","key":"20627001","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-03-04T01:11:40.000Z","id":"5d2f2dc26a300b5922a535d1"}]}}}
