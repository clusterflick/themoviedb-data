The video explores combinations of geometrical formes, building up corresponding sounds. Consious of their roots in historic avantgarde animation, but the same time drawing in structural cinema, the two filmmakers compose a \"picture\" which evolves from rectangels that appear on and disappear from the blank screen. White background, dark \"windows\", in which a figure seen from above passes through at various speeds. His diagonal passage, doubled and inverted, becomes another element of geometry and rhythm. The image, taken from an old film, evokes those of closed-circuit surveillance cameras by its impersonal repetitiveness. The sound obsessivily paces the variation in form on the screen.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Moritz","original_name":"Jürgen Moritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b57d499c3a3685c97045aeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Pfaffenbichler","original_name":"Norbert Pfaffenbichler","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/5IMSPMNujEow6xaHWr1uiN8WQ9k.jpg","credit_id":"5b57d4b40e0a2673dc0452bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0307411","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
