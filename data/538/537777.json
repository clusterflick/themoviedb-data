It clicks, pounds, whooshes, hums, and crackles around the quietly resounding basic theme of the piece. The abstract visual level emphasises the soundtrack, suggesting a digital score, and is vaguely reminiscent of music applications, the user-interface of composition software. At the same time the minimalist images suggest a continual forwards movement, gliding ahead on a parallel voyage through the virtual space: mobile geometry.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"rewind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2091720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annja Krautgasser","original_name":"Annja Krautgasser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9reOHH8jklNtFKcGwCocYpy40mv.jpg","credit_id":"5b57e2090e0a2673cf045cf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
