Ronel describes her swimming pool as a holy space after the tragedy: the last place her son was alive on earth and where she still feels his presence. It’s her place between Heaven and Earth. The documentary revolves around Ronel, Jannie and the Du Plessis family’s vulnerability and mourning process. It is a sensitive exploration of how different people deal with loss and how one day can irrevocably change a life.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Tussen hemel en aarde","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
