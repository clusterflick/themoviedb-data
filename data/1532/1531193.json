From pyramids to antarctic civilizations to hollow earth to lost advanced ice age civilizations. Parroting most of his work from more notorious psuedohistorians like Graham Hancock, Filip doesn't have too many new theories, but laces all of them with a layer of personality that is rarely seen from other creators. In this video we continue our dive into his work where we will discuss topics like ancient stone moving technology, theories suggesting that the Great Pyramid was really a power plant, and the widely shared claim that the Smithsonian Institute destroyed Giant Skeletons. Finally we will tie this whole two part and four hour long video together with my final piece of advice to Filip, in hopes he will take this as a chance to turn his channel around and use it for good. Join me as we begin our final dive into the misinformation of Filip Zeba.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wXvH1aJltb4mHGluQb5aBOpzXnB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miniminuteman Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Filip Zieba Debunked - TikTok's Worst Conspiracy Theorist | Pt. 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5622899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milo Rossi","original_name":"Milo Rossi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lRL9wvnJ2OIdPp67KyqC7d2c6rE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a119b11fda8e3b0e61bc86","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5622899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milo Rossi","original_name":"Milo Rossi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lRL9wvnJ2OIdPp67KyqC7d2c6rE.jpg","credit_id":"68a119c94fbd930eeb86fb5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5630912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shahar Stiglitz","original_name":"Shahar Stiglitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a119f5bdcd3b2b590bfe6d","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5622899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milo Rossi","original_name":"Milo Rossi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lRL9wvnJ2OIdPp67KyqC7d2c6rE.jpg","credit_id":"68a119ff74174b14ef744bc5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5622910,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cale Oglesby","original_name":"Cale Oglesby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a11a11cef007ce5b744d8d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5630911,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Milena Muranyi","original_name":"Milena Muranyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a11a1dd1fd6bffb602cedc","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5622904,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gianfranco Botto","original_name":"Gianfranco Botto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a11a2bfb7b4a1059744c31","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5622899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milo Rossi","original_name":"Milo Rossi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lRL9wvnJ2OIdPp67KyqC7d2c6rE.jpg","credit_id":"68a11a3fc0342b8fdded1544","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wXvH1aJltb4mHGluQb5aBOpzXnB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":940}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
