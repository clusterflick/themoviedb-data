Two gentlemen in suits enter a laundry and dispute over the soaking linen which washing powder is better - Radion, or Schichtal. Their discussion gradually develops into an argument and finally into a fistfight. The next frames present a collage composed of photographs of the washing powder Schichtal, a seductive sphinx and a little head of a man accompanied by text recommending products from the Schicht company (Radion, Schichtal, Kalodont, Elida and Ceres).  The commercial for the Czechoslovak-based Schicht company was filmed abroad. Information as to whether the film was submitted for censorship is unknown. The title originates from the text presented at the beginning of the commercial and the year of production was estimated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schichtal, or Radion?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Schichtal oder Radion das ist jetzt die Frage","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
