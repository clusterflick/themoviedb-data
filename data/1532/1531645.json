In the morning, the Sun in the sky wakes up little angels who start cleaning their teeth with Kalodont toothpaste immediately. At noon, they clean their teeth again under the supervision of St Peter, while in the evening their mouth hygiene is overseen by the Moon. The angels use the same toothpaste in the morning, at noon as well as in the evening. The Moon observes Earth through a telescope, watching a beautiful girl who also prefers Kalodont toothpaste.  The commercial for the Czechoslovak-based Schicht company (Jiří Schicht a. s.) was filmed abroad. The Bulletin of the Ministry of Interior only provides the German title of the film; information about the existence of the Czech distribution title did not survive. The given Czech title was translated from German.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Sky and on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Im Himmel und auf Erden","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
