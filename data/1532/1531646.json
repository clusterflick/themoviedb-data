She's been frequenting a local club and has taken to a dancer named Jewel. Jewel is paid to take notice, and she fancies Sonique as well. Unfortunately, the club owner has taken notice, and after weekly \"reports\" take place, an international crime syndicate decides to use this \"connection\" to it's advantage. They pay off Jewel to \"befriend\" Sonique and ultimately get information. Jewel already knows who this \"regular\" is and welcomes the opportunity to get closer. Although she doesn't care about extracting information and certainly holds no allegiance to this crime syndicate, she hates dishonesty. She recognizes somebody closeted from 10 miles off and she decides she can use her position to \"out\" Sonique. After a staged \"attack\" and Sonique coming to the rescue, it's back to her place for a \"thank you\" and glass of wine. The rest goes from there as Jewel works her magic.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liberation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5546394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ophelia H.
