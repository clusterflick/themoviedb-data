Chris Hemsworth and Marvelous are a couple, much to the chagrin of Chris' ex Sunder. Finding out on live television her longtime boyfriend broke up with her and her best friend is now dating him, sends Sunder reeling. Recently escaped convict Reyna takes advantage of Sunder's temporary weakness and uses her connections to division to hatch a plan to capture, humiliate, and destroy Marvelous. The setup works perfectly and Marvelous is shocked to find herself working against both Reyna and Sunder. Although Marvelous and Sunder are matched, the addition of Reyna and her prisoner collar courtesy of Division pose too much for the poor heroine as she finds herself outmatched, humiliated, and defeated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/osY3tf6VUD6ed4REgHVUQAfrcj0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Betrayed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5546394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ophelia H.
