It explores who Lourens was before South Africa’s democratic transition in 1994 and examines his role during a time of deep political division. After the election, Lourens is tasked with a profound challenge: to protect Mandela – a man labelled a “terrorist” by the former regime. The film delves into the complex, often conflicting truths surrounding his time in office, as well as his adjustment to life after leaving the presidency. At its core, the story follows the evolving relationship between Lourens and his son, Luan – a powerful exploration of loyalty, conflict and eventual reconciliation between two generations.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Verander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
