Felix the Cat sails the sea as a cabin boy, and the boat founders even though Felix and the captain spot the upcoming storm in time. The two survivors are captured by a local tribe of cannibals; they are imprisoned and seem to face death. Yummy Yum, the king of the cannibals, however, has a conceited daughter Ufrfina and decides to reprieve the two captives in order to meet her wishes, as well as the wishes of his subjects - only the men have to buy themselves out by the things from the list submitted by the cannibals. The desperate captives have no idea where to get so many things so fast. A magician hears their weeping. He conjures them two beetles who get them everything the cannibals crave. Felix wonders at this and the beetles confess to owning the Brouk and Babka department stores where everything is available.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":131273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elekta Journal","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cabin Boy on Salty Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1704028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Dodal","original_name":"Karel Dodal","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a24d4d170a359fa2ed1a4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1704028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Dodal","original_name":"Karel Dodal","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a24d5b272739876d87002c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1704028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Dodal","original_name":"Karel Dodal","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a24d7cfff628af4d745292","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1704028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Dodal","original_name":"Karel Dodal","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a24d8d9f918b6df361c4bd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hermína Týrlová","original_name":"Hermína Týrlová","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/vV1PsS4BaXRZ2cp5FnHjx6p4kB0.jpg","credit_id":"68a24d9dbdbb85ca8b18cddb","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
