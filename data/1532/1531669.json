Where there's prohibition, there's smuggling, and there's money to be made for everyone in the chain. We found smugglers, users, fences, middlemen, and institutions in China, Taiwan, and the US involved in this pipeline flowing export controlled GPUs to China. This is in violation of US Government law, which now includes imposed numerous restrictions on semiconductor processing capabilities, making legitimate export of high-end GPUs to Chinese companies or governments impossible without rarely-granted licenses. But while this is going on, the US Government, NVIDIA, and AMD have been negotiating a cut of sales of two specific models of GPU in order to unblock over $6 billion in combined lost revenue between the companies.  This is our first full-length, highly produced movie we've ever created. This was made possible thanks to our viewers supporting our ambitions.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":209,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Investigating Smuggling, Corruption, & Governments","title":"THE NVIDIA AI GPU BLACK MARKET","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Burke","original_name":"Steve Burke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Steve Burke","credit_id":"68a250c0ec51f3f47061c2ba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632472,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Burke","original_name":"Steve Burke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a251512272ef7a080c026f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632472,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Burke","original_name":"Steve Burke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a253400864b4d7f68702b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Burke","original_name":"Steve Burke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a2534ea8d0923f1f02d3e6","department":"Editing","job":"Lead Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632500,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vitalii Makhnovets","original_name":"Vitalii Makhnovets","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a25364272739876d87004a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632501,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Phetdara","original_name":"Tim Phetdara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a2537033c6c25af061c368","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632502,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Coleman","original_name":"Andrew Coleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a25387b2f26eaa0361c3e6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632504,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andrew Coleman","original_name":"Andrew Coleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a25398e201e6ae98632809","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632505,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tannen Williams","original_name":"Tannen Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a253a781e83663fced19a2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Benson","original_name":"Ben Benson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a253b7ae11225da061c29e","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Benson","original_name":"Ben Benson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a253c482293c7d1561c2e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"gamersnexus"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9En0dzobwiTyx4kcP9CRKyPkili.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Released on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H3xQaf7BFI","release_date":"2025-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Released on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H3xQaf7BFI","release_date":"2025-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Detained by a Government & Probably Blacklisted by NVIDIA for Our Next Investigation","key":"ltgyS8oJC8g","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2025-08-09T02:53:46.000Z","id":"68a25118d1fd6bffb602d46b"}]}}}
