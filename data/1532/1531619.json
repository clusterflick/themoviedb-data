A painter's hand adds two skinny boys to a painting. The boys have a sausage and a wandering dog steals it from them. In a while, another two younger, but also skinny boys, playing at American Indians, join the chase after the dog, running away with the sausage. The older boys, however, finally pursue the younger boys instead of the dog, who eats the sausage in the meantime. The younger boys run into a factory complex in the Prague neighbourhood of Hlubočepy. A well-nurtured cook welcomes them and feeds the hungry and skinny boys almost to the verge of bursting. When the older pursuers arrive, they are surprised how fast the two younger boys gained weight. The concluding text of the commercial claims: \"Every proper boy must feed on margarine.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See How Two Boys and a Dog Fool around These Days!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
