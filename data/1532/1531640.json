Two farmers, Malý a Moc [Small and Mighty], overlook their beet fields. The beets in the first field are bigger, because farmer Small employs artificial fertilizers. The beets in the field of farmer Mighty are apparently smaller and withering, because he fertilizes his field with manure instead of potash. At night, the hungry beets from his field rise up as soon as they find out why their colleagues from the field of farmer Small are doing so well, and they organize a protest. They sneak into their farmer's dream and start threatening him. The frightened farmer Mighty wakes up from the scream dream and immediately orders artificial fertilizers for his beet field.  The Propagafilm Prague company executed a Czech version of the commercial, while the differences between the individual passages of the original, produced by the Svend Nolden Berlin company, and of the extended Czech version are well distinguishable.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1928-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beet Rebellion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svend Noldan","original_name":"Svend Noldan","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a244a2c787e44223632830","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
