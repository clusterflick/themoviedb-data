South Africa’s unique, endemic succulents are being poached to the brink of extinction, smuggled to the East and sold to an online market driven by social media. While international syndicates pocket billions of dollars, locals are paid next to nothing to put their lives on the line. This short documentary follows the brilliant botanist Pieter van Wyk in his efforts to protect South Africa’s unique ecosystem from devastation. Side by side with dedicated conservationists and specially trained sniffer dogs, the world of illegal succulent trade is revealed. Amid the destruction, a story of resilience and hope unfolds.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Vet vannie land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
