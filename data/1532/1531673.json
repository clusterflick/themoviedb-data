At the center of this arduous modernist attitude in art is İlhan Usmanbaş, who was born in 1921 in the Ottoman Empire, whose atonal music of the 1950s influenced not only the field of music but also literature. As an essay film, Modernist: Usmanbaş both traces the composer's insistence on playing 20th century music in his compositions and visual notation and follows him in the private nursing home where he lived from the age of 100 to 103. While the film records Usmanbaş's curiosity in natural history and the intellectual structure he built between music, science and mathematics with the testimonies of the last years of his life, it also makes references to modernist art in formal terms as a meta attitude.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sJrPRx186QT5Ry2EumTArlt8HMK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":271432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atonal Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Music is math, science, and modernist openness.","title":"Usmanbaş: Modernist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4331536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"İlhan Usmanbaş","original_name":"İlhan Usmanbaş","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68a2524add19827b5c0c00be","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4859832,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Elif Dizdaroğlu","original_name":"Elif Dizdaroğlu","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a2526a9f918b6df361c54d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serdar Kökçeoğlu","original_name":"Serdar Kökçeoğlu","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a2527ffdd156779b632776","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serdar Kökçeoğlu","original_name":"Serdar Kökçeoğlu","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a253ff81e83663fced19a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4859832,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Elif Dizdaroğlu","original_name":"Elif Dizdaroğlu","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a25422a6491ec12e02d2b1","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hazal Bayar","original_name":"Hazal Bayar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a254427a8d3655a802d34d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1809,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sJrPRx186QT5Ry2EumTArlt8HMK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1290}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233556,"name":"modernism"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"},{"id":349453,"name":"atonal music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
