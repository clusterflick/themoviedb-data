A traveller wearing enormous shoes stands amidst barefoot blacks in Africa. A lion, feared by everyone, runs up and the native hunters try to kill or at least chase it away with their primitive weapons. The beast, however, keeps swallowing one after another. It only spares the traveller because he is wearing Krasa shoes. The footage then displays the text \"I'll spare you, bro, if you wear Krása shoes!\"  Despite all attempts, the researchers did not succeed in finding the title, year of production and the producer of the film. The film is incomplete and it was acquired from the Krása family archives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Krása Footwear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
