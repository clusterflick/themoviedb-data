A cow does not let him milk her and a hen refuses to give him eggs. Uncle Bobby goes for help to a magic king who lives in a forest in a mushroom-shaped cottage. The king turns Uncle Bobby into a charming commercial doll of the Schicht company. Uncle Bobby in his new guise easily milks the cow and gets eggs from the hen. He then returns to the factory with the milk and the eggs. It turns out that the story was being watched by the dolls from the theatre auditorium. Now, the curtain on the stage is pulled back and Uncle Bobby is in front of it and enjoys the applause of the audience.\r The commercial for the Czechoslovak-based Schicht company (Jiří Schicht a. s.) was filmed abroad.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":263622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excentric-Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":271430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schicht Ústí nad Labem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metamorphosis of Uncle Bobby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Onkel Bobbys Verwandlung","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
