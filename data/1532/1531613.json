A pencil draws a man and a lion, subsequently adding iron bars around the animal. The man is fighting with the lion. The cat first devours the man and then spits him out. An elephant appears - the image known from the Koh-i-noor erasing rubber - and performs some acrobatics. The rubber with the elephant erases the picture of the lion and the pencil scribbles over the man's figure.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Pencil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Zauberblei","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Granass","original_name":"Bruno Granass","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a23720c2774a02490bffac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
