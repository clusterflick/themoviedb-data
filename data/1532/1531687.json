She's got the jump on Octavia and makes quick work of the villainess and her henchman. Octavia is sentenced to 10 years hard time. She's got connections though, and after only 3 years, she manages to get released. Three years is long enough to plot her revenge and as soon as she's free, Octavia sets the trap. Red is dispatched as intelligence suggests Octavia is once again trying to illegally acquire weapons of mass destruction. Upon arrival, Red easily dispatches the two henchmen and locates the weapon. It's too easy though as she realizes the weapon is a decoy. A forcefield engages and it's too late before Red realizes it's a trap. Octavia's plan has worked so far. Find out what's in store for poor Redwing as Octavia shows no mercy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eOzrPnZwTddZdJZ6ecO7yGBsII0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vengeance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5611156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco","original_name":"Coco","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Redwing","credit_id":"68a258716c94ec6bc06328bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5546394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ophelia H.
