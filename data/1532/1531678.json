Spejbl forces his son Hurvínek to bathe every Saturday in a trough, but the son protests that the trough is outdated and unfit for bathing, because he might even get a splinter in his body. He reproaches his father for breaking the promise of buying a new bathtub. Spejbl thus writes a letter to a plumber, and the content Hurvínek soon bathes in a new, cast-iron bathtub.  The titles state that the show was performed by the Pilsner Puppet Theatre of Ferial Settlements with the approval of the author of the puppets, Professor Josef Skupa.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":271431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reklama-Slavia Praha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spejblův případ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
