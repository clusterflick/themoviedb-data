She puts their past aside and shows up quickly. She soon finds WW is not in need of rescuing and is more interested in taking her anger out on SG. WW seems to have forgotten she dumped SG but SG soon realizes WW's odd behavior is a result of a stone hanging around her neck. WW claims she received this stone from a \"secret admirer\" and before this information fully sinks in, the \"secret admirer\" shows up ready to do some damage. The heroines are weak from fighting each other and are in no condition to fully take on both the \"secret admirer\" and his support thug. It never ends well and this is no exception.
