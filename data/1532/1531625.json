We follow his story from childhood to young man to prisoner and learn about how he turned his life around in prison. After 22 years, he is released on parole, and he marries Engeline Fortuin. We take a walk with him through Westbury and see all the places that mean something to him. He introduces us to characters from his past and present. We meet Alisterâ€™s mom, Felicity, who says, to her, he was always just Alister, not Jan Bloed. Alister opens about his son in prison, Vercaino. He dreams of being a better father and a positive influence on Vercaino. As a pastor he strives to change the hearts and minds of the new generation. Will there be a relapse into crime for this family, or will they stand strong? Will they walk the straight and narrow together in Westbury, or will their paths take them in different directions?","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Jan Bloed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
