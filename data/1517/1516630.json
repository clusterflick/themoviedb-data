From early drama work at HTV on shows like Sky and King of the Castle, they became regular Doctor Who writers in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Their most iconic creation is the robot dog K9, a beloved companion to the Doctor for four years and star of its own spin-off, K9 & Company.  In this Myth Makers, Nicholas Briggs talks with Bob and Dave about K9’s origins, how other writers handled the character, the making of the K9 special, and their thoughts on it.  They also explore the creative ideas behind their Doctor Who stories and reflect on a thirty-year writing partnership that allowed for solo ventures—Dave into detective novels, and Bob into the Oscar-winning Wallace & Gromit.  And the future? Could K9 return?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/xISQm2WDhtNeFkJTETwGpuspIb3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 49: Bob Baker and Dave Martin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7315,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Baker","original_name":"Bob Baker","popularity":0.1901,"profile_path":"/wtGEsApDa7FaxZI3VJUQmtrAxuO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"687e4ffe20e51d61b7244a63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230516,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dave Martin","original_name":"Dave Martin","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/zFpqjIF2z9qzD7M0M23VFDlZzJU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"687e5015fe85a1d545244920","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xISQm2WDhtNeFkJTETwGpuspIb3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
