In the airport on the return trip, the trio began shooting scenes with the movie function on a digital still camera, then edited, scored and titled the film during the flight. Before Aaron Katz had finished the real film, Swanberg e-mailed a link to his version and claimed to have just sent his rough cut to Sundance, sending Katz into a panic until he realized he'd been hoodwinked.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Swanberg's Quiet City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Swanberg","original_name":"Joe Swanberg","popularity":0.5112,"profile_path":"/fv4N4HkrQ7FUNEYJm1XVcnhoPRe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"687db6c4585597c100f76c47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tipper Newton","original_name":"Tipper Newton","popularity":0.1546,"profile_path":"/eTe3mMQuGkwdEeS6aW4M8dm6NuT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jamie","credit_id":"687db6d12b930fb6d5528d1d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tipper Newton","original_name":"Tipper Newton","popularity":0.1546,"profile_path":"/eTe3mMQuGkwdEeS6aW4M8dm6NuT.jpg","credit_id":"687db782256e60aa3c528fbc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arin Crumley","original_name":"Arin Crumley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687db790f56b89c49b528e93","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Bewersdorf","original_name":"Kevin Bewersdorf","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687db79c50915a744e24492e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
