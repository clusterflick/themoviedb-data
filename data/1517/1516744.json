This normal guy created a normal family and thus has the kind of good fortune that anyone would be envious of. Nothing is unsatisfactory about his life, we would expect. But even so, Hailey believes something to change his day-to-day routine awaits him at some point down the line. One day, on his daily commute, he looks up from a train station platform to discover a ballroom dance studio. As he stares at a beautiful woman standing in the studio's window, a vague notion comes to him: What if he were to muster up a bit of courage and march right toward the door? Would his fortunes see a massive change? Piqued by this thought, and after much inner debate, Hailey sets foot inside the dance studio.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/35RcQROpMxktGxBlOQqOmNKVfxM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shall we Dance?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2382973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"So Kazuho","original_name":"壮一帆","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/7YrglI2DBpzDKDi4L0foDs6alxN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hailey Hartz","credit_id":"687e9a1bf9fcc95b9ad993b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2743080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayu Manaka","original_name":"愛加あゆ","popularity":0.2422,"profile_path":"/qCDvC8Hhhfwn1fNaCVUjNgAxUmK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jocelyn Hartz","credit_id":"687e9a29440b8c6121f76e26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1928411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seina Sagiri","original_name":"早霧せいな","popularity":0.1347,"profile_path":"/dXjiJcCS85rk3haOmqbaMCpLM2w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ella","credit_id":"687e9a333f67cfd7aa55d204","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2763799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masumi Rika","original_name":"梨花ますみ","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/68xv8yN6ywUO1bH5drH8iveVX8m.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Shelia","credit_id":"687e9a550f25d300c3529298","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3386244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayanagi Shou","original_name":"彩凪翔","popularity":0.149,"profile_path":"/95OopmQEAg3KCH1DSWbgE1dgLAt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"687e9a777587c4222af76f76","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3228754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakina Ayakaze","original_name":"彩風咲奈","popularity":0.1555,"profile_path":"/6WbzQjkIQLEpwXJVoSKwEZhZgFY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leon","credit_id":"687e9a863cf100600b5290f7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3378395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanato Tsukishiro","original_name":"月城かなと","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":"/ywWXHKcQJltdKGOmDHSPGFrd3JZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"687e9a9bc2adade24055d342","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3380136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sea Towaki","original_name":"永久輝せあ","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/oBZXs6LfnAljlxynkeKnjh8oGH4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"687e9aa6c2adade24055d345","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3398276,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Koyanagi Naoko","original_name":"小柳奈穂子","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/dC0kCt6iMDd5GgltfTx98HvzGti.jpg","credit_id":"687e9ab922c579e4f038dd17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6gOAE9OuPATzDnGyaim0aInX8Fe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":930,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/35RcQROpMxktGxBlOQqOmNKVfxM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":615}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
