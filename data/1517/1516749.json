This normal guy created a normal family and thus has the kind of good fortune that anyone would be envious of. Nothing is unsatisfactory about his life, we would expect. But even so, Hailey believes something to change his day-to-day routine awaits him at some point down the line. One day, on his daily commute, he looks up from a train station platform to discover a ballroom dance studio. As he stares at a beautiful woman standing in the studio's window, a vague notion comes to him: What if he were to muster up a bit of courage and march right toward the door? Would his fortunes see a massive change? Piqued by this thought, and after much inner debate, Hailey sets foot inside the dance studio.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kCocKwtJ603VN5AoGvzFBz3pWa6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shall we Dance?
