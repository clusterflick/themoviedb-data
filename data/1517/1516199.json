The film traces his journey from a small town in Galicia to a career as a groundbreaking psychiatrist in the US; his exploits as a lover, hypnotist, swindler, a spy between the two world wars, and his actions in the Buchenwald concentration camp, which led him to stand trial as a Nazi war criminal. Katzen-Ellenbogen's story is an allegory of how individuals adapt to moral darkness - and the ways they find to thrive and blossom in the darkest of times.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adaptation to Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36962574","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
