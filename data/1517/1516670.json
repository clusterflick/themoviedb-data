It was condemned by the British government and denounced in the press as sensationalist. After one of its witnesses retracted his statement, \"Death on the Rock\" became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry, in which it was largely vindicated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pTUPqYQSnNXKkrxHTtukHd1q5xJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death on the Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Dimbleby","original_name":"Jonathan Dimbleby","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/awyjKEU9bH0UD8wvOO0C3GGXs60.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"687e68bda33cb327a372cdaf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233350,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Bolton","original_name":"Roger Bolton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687e688d223102bc3e55d10a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pTUPqYQSnNXKkrxHTtukHd1q5xJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
