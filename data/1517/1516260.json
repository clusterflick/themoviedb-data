Mija exists between silent conversations and inner stillness. Things take an unexpected change as her distant friendship with Ieva shifts. Reality slowly starts to connect with dreams, memories and what could be projections of her own mind. This is a visually sensitive and atmospheric story about inner worlds, human connections and how easily one can become lost between reality and illusion.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/a2i186Pic9Q5n33FQOjXwhG3y6K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nekoks
