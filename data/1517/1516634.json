As one of Britain’s dedicated character actors David had built a career in television, theatre, radio and commercials that paid a living and still allowed him to walk down the street unnoticed. He was happy – he didn’t really want to be K9’s voice!  Perhaps it was the wealth of experience that David could bring to K9, his ability to give K9 more depth, that appealed to Christopher Barry and John Nathan-Turner when they were casting for Creature from the Pit. Whatever their reasons – they wanted David.  In this Myth Makers, Nicholas Briggs finds out why David finally took the job and the challenges and rewards he found. And why did he leave after only one season?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7WJ2hzD3rwabO4eYOrsfMgchYEm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 51: David Brierley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1746711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Brierley","original_name":"David Brierley","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/bKhQskYazMdDfIaT3xqrPrIp1U3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"687e55e44a27e542aed99365","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7WJ2hzD3rwabO4eYOrsfMgchYEm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
