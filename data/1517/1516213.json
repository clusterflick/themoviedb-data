From the production of the last Tom Baker season in 1979 to Sylvester McCoy’s third and last in 1989, John oversaw one of the most controversial periods in the programme’s history.  At locations used for The Curse of Fenric, John chats to Nicholas Briggs about his career, his ten year stint as producer, the casting of three Doctors… and puts the record straight about the reasons behind Doctor Who’s cancellation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/u5z27uGt7nhe2kcUIXI7n5pjTet.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 22: John Nathan Turner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Nathan-Turner","original_name":"John Nathan-Turner","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":"/R43WMuSn8B6ALdXtxT2RUXkbM0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"687d22b9a9c1f6893e38d64c","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u5z27uGt7nhe2kcUIXI7n5pjTet.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
