Zakir's father was martyred in the Karabakh war. He lives with his mother, and his main ideal is to return to the lands for which his father died. The hero, rejecting the voice given to him by God, chooses military school instead of mugham art. He thinks that on such a difficult day for the homeland, it is necessary to defend it with a weapon in hand.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/5msC2qNG6lrvipQcdH108UtX9BN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104565,"logo_path":"/fGWe9z12Cp50CvUVfbdSfk9Mh2B.png","name":"Azerbaijanfilm","origin_country":"AZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2007-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biz
