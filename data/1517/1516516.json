In the mountains of Huizhou, Mr. Fang, a wise elder, craftsman, and poet, shares his world with the person behind the camera, a foreigner, from his backyard.  Through deep convictions and a connection to their roots, an interaction of culture and humanity flourishes between them, organically and without barriers, inviting us to savor the essence of life's simple pleasures.  This poetic documentary embodies the truth that life, in its purest form, is often found in quiet moments, celebrating profound connections that transcend language, culture, or money, and the timeless lessons of a life well-lived.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qiang Chisel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170293,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"João Lucas Aguiar","original_name":"João Lucas Aguiar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687e18bf6585bd4edbd98ff9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
