With a chaotic evidence board and wild accusations, he presents his case: pristine new stuffed animals have invaded, he barely survived a near-drowning in the sink, and worst of all, he was abandoned beneath the bed. As he relives his supposed betrayals, his paranoia grows and fuels his belief that he has been replaced. But just when all hope seems lost, a flashback reveals the truthâ€”his owner still cherishes him, pulling him back into a warm embrace. Realizing he may have overreacted, he awkwardly revises his theory and considers the newcomers as potential allies. Still, he remains ever-watchful...because you can never be too careful.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/a1DiziNVDHFPXUUNKFutR9qX8jR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"After years of being the favorite stuffed animal, Elephant has been betrayed and is determined to document the evidence.","title":"The Plush Files: An Elephant Conspiracy","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Plush Files","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4667506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hunter Bruce","original_name":"Hunter Bruce","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Elephant","credit_id":"687f064028a6b89656d99586","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5579014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nylah Raghni","original_name":"Nylah Raghni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Owner","credit_id":"687f06519f14f68eb2244c24","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745502,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tobey Munari","original_name":"Tobey Munari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687f0673df411187b516a526","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745502,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tobey Munari","original_name":"Tobey Munari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687f0690ac0991943b16a806","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5044747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Panzano","original_name":"Alex Panzano","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687f06a8ee4cb01c3fd99498","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4667502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dillanger Higley","original_name":"Dillanger Higley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687f06d8317a5cfe9cf76e58","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4712097,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colin Kirkpatrick","original_name":"Colin Kirkpatrick","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/56IGN6z5zLlr0VO0XhdSeElGrQc.jpg","credit_id":"687f06f89f14f68eb2244c28","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745502,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tobey Munari","original_name":"Tobey Munari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687f07100e4818a9995292fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4667515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lar Ruiz De Velasco Alzaga","original_name":"Lar Ruiz De Velasco Alzaga","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687f0728e20a3e8dabf76e71","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4667515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lar Ruiz De Velasco Alzaga","original_name":"Lar Ruiz De Velasco Alzaga","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687f07379677276c5116a79e","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36937504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1226,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xQzoRWzcpuXz7EAAb53ONOg6uxQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2180},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1224,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/19ZKoJb6Ae9D6CVcTXUJBBgzEFY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2176},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1230,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8MRub0L0MoOnc2RotVTjUGKOjYf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2186},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1220,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tpEQx8M7ZfA0bJ9yT9kxljUF75U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2169},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1222,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z8tOpJjggnoimdJApfq1kBF8E6Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2172},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1226,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4bdnT82xddyKGSCpZeeZCSSZOx5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2180}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1DiziNVDHFPXUUNKFutR9qX8jR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7zkxSbLeRz7Cy4SZWBXIxoZBhWC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Plush Files - Trailer","key":"FIJGDDhTfgs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-07-22T03:43:29.000Z","id":"687f0ad522c579e4f038dedc"}]}}}
