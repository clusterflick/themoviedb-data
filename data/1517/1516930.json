In front of a similar sheet, in an empty movie theater, a mother breastfeeds her baby, immersed in deep silence. A silent film tells the story of a cow, marked with the number “432,” who wanders on a beach desperately searching for her missing calf. When the cow finds the dead calf, marked by the number “433,” the film dies with it: the sheet on which the film is projected falls onto the stage, enveloping the entire room in an even deeper silence. The number “433” evokes John Cage's famous silence, but here silence takes on a tragic meaning, representing the stillness of death. The same fate befalls the man on the bed, the embodiment of life within the film, whose movements cease simultaneously at the end of the film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hCvcKnPLDvE8lJcV78Ns8Dm31Lq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come to Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Come to Light - Vir a Tona","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4387860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ceccolini","original_name":"Marco Ceccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ef15309a8f9ddc038dd78","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4387860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ceccolini","original_name":"Marco Ceccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ef15cd43cbc8a1355d3a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4387860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ceccolini","original_name":"Marco Ceccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ef16e3cf100600b52921d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4387860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ceccolini","original_name":"Marco Ceccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ef17a096e0ed3fb72d065","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4387860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ceccolini","original_name":"Marco Ceccolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ef193cd0a0d7884f76e7b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2995,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hCvcKnPLDvE8lJcV78Ns8Dm31Lq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ANIMAPHIX ff 2025 COMPETIZIONE NAZIONALE - PREMIO GIANNALBERTO BENDAZZI","release_date":"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
