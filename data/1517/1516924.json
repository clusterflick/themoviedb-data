This ancient coral atoll, isolated for millions of years from other reef systems and mainland influences, has developed its own sub populations of unique species.  Formed more than 15 million years ago Scott Reef is home to more than 1200 species including endangered seas snakes, green turtles and spectacular corals.  Endangered pygmy whales and other rare cetaceans stop at Scott Reef on their annual migrations to feed on the abundant krill. It is one of only a few spots along the west coast of Australia where krill can be found in sufficient quantities to replenish the needs of these large creatures.  But Scott Reef is under threat.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tdoVqB9xevK3e82bqy2YONgBTAk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fremantle
