The video is therefore born from the poetics of Pirandello’s works, combined with the suggestions of the place. There is no linear narrative but it presents itself as a dreamlike journey, also conducted following the music of Lero Lero, a band from Palermo that takes up the popular songs of Sicily.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6MLZhr7zIuyw9EEQ1uE6swEPZTR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Was The Moon!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"C’era la Luna !","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5578773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simone Caramazza","original_name":"Simone Caramazza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ee2aa3855a70164244dc7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5578773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simone Caramazza","original_name":"Simone Caramazza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ee2bbb94e667f8b52933e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5578773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simone Caramazza","original_name":"Simone Caramazza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687ee2c70e4818a99952927d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6MLZhr7zIuyw9EEQ1uE6swEPZTR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ANIMAPHIX FF 2025  Competizione Nazionale - Premio Giannalberto Bendazzi","release_date":"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
