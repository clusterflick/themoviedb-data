Davis’ ethnographic research, this multi-voiced film explores how girls and women in Maithil society in North India and Nepal turn to collective art forms – storytelling, the performance of folktales and painting – and in particular the story of Sama, to reflect on changes and continuities in social rules and conventions for women over time. The film uses various styles, including dramatization, observational scenes, and in-depth conversations with participants.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sama in the Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5579034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos G.
