The magenta-shifted fragments of an educational film on \"Reaching Your Reader\" reveal their chemistry where the splicing tape ripped a \"ruby skin\" of the emulsion away from the base of the film, leaving a green tear at the edit points. Ruby Skin is a material homage to the disappearing medium and some of its idiosyncrasies.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gjhKerEMWJNQ0WNoFBXXR3y3Xw4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruby Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eve Heller","original_name":"Eve Heller","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/vowyir3HHg8GNMNd31OPcslxotp.jpg","credit_id":"63a64c5d907f260094410266","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":941,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gjhKerEMWJNQ0WNoFBXXR3y3Xw4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":627}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
