All three sites were built with certain worldviews: visions of the future and US-influenced promises of progress that didn't turn out to be the utopias they presented themselves as. Through multi-lingual texts, a site-specific soundtrack, 16mm and 3D images, the spaces and their implications are subjectively mapped, poeticized and questioned. A poetic materialism of decay, renewal, remembering and projecting, \"Center, Ring, Mall\" is perhaps a mourning, but one that desires and demands a rebirth.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/hCL4fEaBdITjOf5LRokEKlkBWUB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Center, Ring, Mall","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2714729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mateo Vega","original_name":"Mateo Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a66116fcb8cc008751ed92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32132622","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1684,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hCL4fEaBdITjOf5LRokEKlkBWUB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1191}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
