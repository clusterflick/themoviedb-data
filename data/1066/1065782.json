The images generated in the tape act according to specific parameters set by the artist. Sandin has stated \"The analog Image Processor was programmed to implement the logic equations; if square, if triangle and circle show circle.\" In this tape, Sandin is in effect arguing for a distinct video vocabulary that replaces the classical concept of perspective. This tape was produced at the University of Illinois Chicago.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":"/6G9X3bMtrmII3Le7QASbeihL58z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triangle in Front of Square in Front of Circle in Front of Triangle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Sandin","original_name":"Dan Sandin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a8f75f15a4a10082d25866","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6G9X3bMtrmII3Le7QASbeihL58z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
