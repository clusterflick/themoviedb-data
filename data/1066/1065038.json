Smith ultimately takes us on an expansive and intimate 70-year journey, from Branson's upbringing as the son of a spirited, tough-love mother in Britain, to his pursuits of extreme, personal daredevilry that serve both to grow his businesses' brands and feed his insatiable, lifelong thirst for high-stakes adventure. With added insight from family members, business associates, and journalists, and illustrated by decades of archival and home video footage, Branson reveals the ups and downs of a man driven by risk taking in both his business and personal life, reflecting on the costs and rewards of his lifelong, relentless optimism and boundary-pushing.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":252,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Branson in space!","title":"Branson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris smith","original_name":"Chris smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a64e1d8a84d200b4ce9727","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23865600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"HBO Max","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
