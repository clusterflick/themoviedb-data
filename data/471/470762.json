It has a new smell, it can’t speak or bark, and it cries a lot. FudgeFudge and Marshmallow’s parents don’t seem to have time to throw a stick or rub a belly anymore. All they do is sit and look at the new animal. The two dogs devise various ways to distract the people’s attention from the new animal. But when a new person called Grandpa comes to visit, FudgeFudge and Marshmallow decide that no matter how\r much they hate it, the new animal is theirs, and there is no way that Grandpa will be allowed to touch their animal. In this sweet and delightful movie, viewers will explore the changing dynamics of a growing family from a dog’s eye view.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/2bRLusmivi70bDq8ZejYCcIuhOC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":"/qTvhJHw5ixJX9t0cR81cF4eVvfO.png","name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That New Animal","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1683857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Jenkins","original_name":"Emily Jenkins","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63ace7f85ad76b007dc63f48","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1652530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul R.
