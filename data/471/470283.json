They were the defending state champions, and all five starters were returning for their senior year. They seemed a shoo-in to win a second straight state title, and the five guys all thought they were on a path to become “the next Jordan.”  However, the season didn’t go quite as planned. But the film, produced with Brian Robbins, was an award-winner and a hit on the film festival circuit. Tollin would go on to direct and produce feature films (Varsity Blues, Radio, Coach Carter) and popular TV series such as Smallville, One Tree Hill and Arli$$. He never forgot, though, the magic of the Morningside 5 In fact, he returned a decade later to see how they were doing and made a follow-up film on their various exploits.","popularity":0.2449,"poster_path":"/fYVQIGX3sNQE9ifuAD57BoEf9nd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morningside 5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2384647,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jared Forman","original_name":"Jared Forman","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651b3ca19d592c00c8c4053f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tollin","original_name":"Michael Tollin","popularity":0.3159,"profile_path":"/zZEUZh2Oh20wFBXaEfGvwqCBWmv.jpg","credit_id":"598c514992514107fa01009b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/izAmreBCPsFLmCatPwD33MBb4S2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fYVQIGX3sNQE9ifuAD57BoEf9nd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1383},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2vPP6rnHmHQ1QiHHN8xyN8MTZyd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1382}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
