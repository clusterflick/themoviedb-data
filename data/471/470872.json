A tragicomedy set in Marseille during the municipal elections of June 1995. In populist northern districts, they rally around the \"Nord Ambition\" of Bernard Tapie. In pushing for Tapie to take town hall, they count on his support for the northern districts, but difficulties and disappointments follow. Tapie ends up backing the very enemies of his followers, so what happens then? Big fish eat small ones. This is the fourth installment of the Marseille political saga which began with, \"Marseille from father to son\" (1989).","popularity":0.1557,"poster_path":"/sza0VE1Pno1Z8Q08Lt0Hym83k7I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":169855,"logo_path":"/owxjMUpB2uvfF0sdGrT6gQo2GY4.png","name":"13 Prods","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marseille contre Marseille","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1695349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Claude Gaudin","original_name":"Jean-Claude Gaudin","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/cz6mGFCCmf7iw7aOag94PirbR4P.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627dfa6ec92c5d009d3bd8af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marie Le Pen","original_name":"Jean-Marie Le Pen","popularity":0.0924,"profile_path":"/1BDAqc3CvawW6GUH1CuW64vN8FL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627dfa7bdfe31d0f0c392da9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Tapie","original_name":"Bernard Tapie","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/b9XYqTfSBcRjHWhgpzIIDTqqujZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627dfa846d1bb23315e4b646","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Louis Comolli","original_name":"Jean-Louis Comolli","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/jAglwT3DJjmXKe5cVQc28jQhRn2.jpg","credit_id":"5992452e9251417bef001d48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0400639","wikidata_id":"Q106519088","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1412,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/sza0VE1Pno1Z8Q08Lt0Hym83k7I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
