One cannot appreciate 20th century art without understanding the significance and genius of Paul Cézanne. Filmed at the National Portrait Gallery in London, with additional interviews from experts and curators from MoMA in New York, National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, and Musée d’Orsay in Paris, and correspondence from the artist himself, the film takes audiences to the places Cézanne lived and worked and sheds light on an artist who is perhaps one of the least known and yet most important of all the Impressionists.","popularity":0.5764,"poster_path":"/3sJsoYF9wT6PQpJd4WURoppUp5B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"The world doesn't understand me, and I don't understand the world.\"","title":"Cézanne: Portraits of a Life","video":true,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Exhibition on Screen: Cézanne - Portraits of a Life","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613d29372dc9dc0043781adb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eacf7c166469a001f5cb213","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7829490","wikidata_id":"Q50285193","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWgNqM2r2gQCLwCdrZTvM0R25bV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3sJsoYF9wT6PQpJd4WURoppUp5B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":864,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/t8OnWhYqSPgyzC0izxligWprNOf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":582},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xe8tWh2xXxzaa5HdbWV6aVHnZSj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/vz84jkX2yu78dxFndzwj15fFQvs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/5ooJJCJiyDkyxLUJuY9BK2jYtlp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":756},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/3gzJDfiV7c2zYtVXb75GsC0Psiq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":265473,"name":"exhibition on screen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PR","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fine Arts","release_date":"2023-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cézanne - Portraits of a Life | Trailer","key":"P4L_0PUMeb8","published_at":"2017-11-03T11:52:01.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5a54ab09c3a3685ec700cc2d"}]}}}
