HENNA is an experimental short film symbolizing the struggle between darkness and light inside one womenâ€™s mind. Using the symbol of Indian Henna, traditionally representing life and light, we explore a deep struggle of darkness and death. One wrong step towards the darkness means we can lose the light forever.
