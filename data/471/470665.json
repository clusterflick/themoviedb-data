In the post-war period, 150,000 people were hidden away in 120 of these vast Victorian institutions all across the country. Today, most mental patients, or service users as they are now called, live out in the community and the asylums have all but disappeared. Through powerful testimonies from patients, nurses and doctors, the film explores this seismic revolution and what it tells us about society's changing attitudes to mental illness over the last sixty years.","popularity":0.4556,"poster_path":"/nVxPmI4qhiJZYHbq9NO84fcMf8Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":238186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blakeway Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mental: A History of the Madhouse","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamsin Greig","original_name":"Tamsin Greig","popularity":0.6283,"profile_path":"/qU1ccKUdy9Qlc9OJ0y1spPMQWx7.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a428a0b9251411fd5051c60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Barham","original_name":"Peter Barham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e260b0c031deb0011c59c6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggi Chapman","original_name":"Maggi Chapman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e26146e41eee10011fa767b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3981616,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Colin Skinner","original_name":"Colin Skinner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642182ed8d22fc00ef175fed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Boulding","original_name":"Chris Boulding","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a428a280e0a264f7703a370","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Thomas","original_name":"Bill Thomas","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64662e5b33a37600e6794f64","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116700,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joe Taylor","original_name":"Joe Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e261992031deb0011c5a8eb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515980,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ian Meller","original_name":"Ian Meller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e261a09c3bffe00165b0cc5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907263,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Jessel","original_name":"Adam Jessel","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e261a3cb39e35001aa4ebe8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384495,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Richard Touch","original_name":"Richard Touch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e261a4a031deb0011c5a97d","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Boulding","original_name":"Chris Boulding","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d95678258c3c400d18463a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Scott","original_name":"Peter Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d9569b6c20fc93bd9da49f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1663170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nVxPmI4qhiJZYHbq9NO84fcMf8Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":199214,"name":"mental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
