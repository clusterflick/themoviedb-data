It's a demanding position, leaving him little time for his private life. But he is committed. At the beginning of the school year, his daughter has come to stay with him. Laura is 14 and has arrived from Tahiti with her mother for the first time after his separation, shaking up his calm existence.

Francois is more than a teacher, he's a friend and a protector.","popularity":0.5086,"poster_path":"/aNx1BABxpBqLAZnu6Lt7RpyYdZu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27807,"logo_path":"/cLfPvVsTuGafzpQ41Pw74biLVZM.png","name":"Image & Compagnie","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Principal","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marie Bigard","original_name":"Jean-Marie Bigard","popularity":0.2201,"profile_path":"/nyFEEt4RwliwFMVOJqULaVETcz6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"François Ragueneau","credit_id":"598adc6f9251414bfa02b189","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":210196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laure Killing","original_name":"Laure Killing","popularity":0.1322,"profile_path":"/ybkX3AHGHh9RpAHbwg7IZWQHVPw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"598adc8ac3a36875260271e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Caillon","original_name":"Anne Caillon","popularity":0.1994,"profile_path":"/wyJlToDga9aFKIMsmbT3iXrLh5R.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gabrielle","credit_id":"598adca19251416b50029dd9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manon Gaurin","original_name":"Manon Gaurin","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/3IDRHTVuArCbdadcg2eyvSSRFDl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lucie","credit_id":"598adcbac3a36824e201d960","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Elso","original_name":"Pascal Elso","popularity":0.2148,"profile_path":"/tE8FylEfUeyzqNpGVjGNYw7iyq4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Laplanche","credit_id":"598adcd4925141370601ffe1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Tomé","original_name":"Marina Tomé","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/pJGF3e5v6wksVNWCRDYkyafDVlF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Michèle Balint","credit_id":"598adcec9251414bac02e048","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Scotto di Carlo","original_name":"Michel Scotto di Carlo","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":"/8jVRnXgH76PHlV2dmGkSRgWrseY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Gaspard","credit_id":"598add11c3a3687865028bc5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryline Even","original_name":"Maryline Even","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":"/r5BGH44SP0cCUKS7x3eonqUGpfg.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Chantal","credit_id":"598add2b9251414bac02e08b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Moncla","original_name":"Arthur Moncla","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/1xTABW99tMqRHxkS3qGex9iw8nY.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Kevin","credit_id":"64640e3c0284200119bcb6b6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mélanie Sitbon","original_name":"Mélanie Sitbon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"64640e500284200136380b5a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1114608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Maës","original_name":"Valérie Maës","popularity":0.3942,"profile_path":"/f4MpPBV8Yl7r3WARU1C8QoOFt2E.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Isabelle","credit_id":"64640e57d05a030170c14a06","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1369234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Solignac","original_name":"Vincent Solignac","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/fkS7C2paUxlLkrF18HEMWeD41ny.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"M.
