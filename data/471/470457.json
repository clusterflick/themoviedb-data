As a young ambitious missionary three decades ago, Dan, a red-bearded towering American, decamped to the Amazon rain forest to save indigenous souls. His assignment was to translate the book of Mark into the tongue of the Pirah, a people whose puzzling speech seemed unrelated to any other on Earth. What he learned during his time with the Pirah led him to question the very foundations of his own deep beliefs. As a 'born again' atheist, Dan divorced his devout Christian wife and became estranged from his children. Having lost faith and family, his new life is dominated by the desire to leave behind his legacy. Everett's most controversial claim is that the Pirah language lacks 'recursion' - the ability to build an infinite number of sentences.","popularity":0.3858,"poster_path":"/62dDHsS6zWnwf14mcOjBCkx8Bgf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6747,"logo_path":"/uLTkpA3dpMrGwBIDin8OByW39gQ.png","name":"Essential Media and Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grammar of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Amazon Code","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Kielikoodin murtaja","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Everett","original_name":"Daniel Everett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"himself","credit_id":"598dda8092514178d6015558","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172916,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randall Wood","original_name":"Randall Wood","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ddb11c3a3687524013ec1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172916,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randall Wood","original_name":"Randall Wood","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ddb2ac3a36875c0013e50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":114336,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Thorburn","original_name":"Chris Thorburn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ddb4692514178ec014c7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael O'Neill","original_name":"Michael O'Neill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ddac4c3a36875a201457a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172916,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randall Wood","original_name":"Randall Wood","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ddb1f92514178b8015c65","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael O'Neill","original_name":"Michael O'Neill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ddaeec3a36875c30163d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael O'Neill","original_name":"Michael O'Neill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ddad8c3a36875b1014130","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2145426","wikidata_id":"Q90492690","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQkrLfroK9SfRfLSOIJ1kbkdTLd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/62dDHsS6zWnwf14mcOjBCkx8Bgf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3olrzt80xrSIiCVcAHC6AXtsiOj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220414,"name":"linguistics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
