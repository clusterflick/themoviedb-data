In just three months, from August to October, the Zanskaris have to harvest and store all their food for the coming year. All the women-young and old alike-work nonstop, from dawn to dusk, and worry about the arrival of winter. Filmed from the point of view of a subjective camera by a young female ethnologist, Land of Women offers a sensitive and poetic immersion in the life of four generations of women during harvesting season. We share their rare intimacy and gradually grow attached to them.","popularity":0.13,"poster_path":"/oKWa0t8o20UUss5tHeoWfhVH1Mu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Himalaya: The Land of Women","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Himalaya, la terre des femmes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"598b1bd19251414bac032899","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20713,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Bernet","original_name":"Olivier Bernet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598b1cd19251414bfa02f6d1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866754,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manuel Catteau","original_name":"Manuel Catteau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598b1d03c3a36874f203328b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1284472","wikidata_id":"Q18633932","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pyjr739RZyVeXsm9oQe1IGnhj1I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYvoYsbpJaPnYxGhct6CbXGNVWE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1682,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oKWa0t8o20UUss5tHeoWfhVH1Mu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1123}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VOD","release_date":"2015-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
