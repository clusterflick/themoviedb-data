In Poland under communism he managed to raise popular music to the rank of true art; he also won renown abroad. He was born in 1939 in Stare Wasiliszki (today's Belarus) and his biography was largely shaped by the tempestuous history of this part of Europe. The film is a portrayal of the charismatic musician, made up of unique archive materials and reminiscences of his family and friends.","popularity":0.2119,"poster_path":"/8KllBKNWpoZNxsXMojIgMoMlh9t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dream of Warsaw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1548899,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Czesław Niemen","original_name":"Czesław Niemen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/mCEVtfqbUtTZQWsnp0TjA2BV0np.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"67cb55e5a4df97db964f616c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1870353,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Krzysztof Magowski","original_name":"Krzysztof Magowski","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599335fcc3a3687f6200161a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1870353,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Krzysztof Magowski","original_name":"Krzysztof Magowski","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59933573925141542b001715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3753858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":936,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/8KllBKNWpoZNxsXMojIgMoMlh9t.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":650},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/7yxxwg2ijvP29IR8blYTMNSxdyE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":636}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
