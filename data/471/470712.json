Many of the residents are away at a dance, and the janitor and his staff decide upon a jollification of their own. They invite their friends to a fine high tea. Everybody is having a fine time, and their spirits are running high. We are now taken to the outside of the hall door, and watch with amusement the frantic pounding and bell ringing of the residents returning from their evening engagements and seeking admission to their apartments. The gay gathering inside are too busy with their own pleasure to heed the angry crowd outdoors. A policeman is called, but all to no purpose, and the tenants are all taken to the station for quarters for the night. Returning to the janitor's quarters we see that the jollifications have been concluded and the guests are all departing. The superior officer at the station concludes to make another effort to gain admittance in the building and, with the tenants at his heels, he approaches the flats.","popularity":0.2434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Janitor's Tea Party","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1586263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Gallet","original_name":"Henri Gallet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5990a011925141674c030ff6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Pré Fils","original_name":"Louis Pré Fils","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/gcWvGga1lfHaIuWNxpqeWe350eM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(as Pré Fils)","credit_id":"5990a01a925141673e03327e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Tissot","original_name":"Alice Tissot","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/8WZGSLi8NdkIB6lsmGvXUHO2fcS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5990a022c3a368744203147d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1869032,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Albert Sorgius","original_name":"Albert Sorgius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c48a5522e4803882a46338","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Feuillade","original_name":"Louis Feuillade","popularity":0.7649,"profile_path":"/6pwcFyr5UI6RHYdIfO91za66tJX.jpg","credit_id":"5990a032c3a36874a3031c5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0208513","wikidata_id":"Q3227659","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1907-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
