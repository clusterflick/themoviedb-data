The subtext of the video is the mythology surrounding white Southern womanhood, historically cited time and time again as an entity to be protected from sexuality, in particular from the presumed hyper-sexuality of black men. Although fiction, this was the excuse for the murder of countless black men and boys in Jim Crow America. Miss Pipi’s Blue Tale is meant to be as deeply contradictory a visual tale as the Blues is in music. Delta Blues often merges broad comedy with despair, sensuality with loss and do-it-yourself urgency with structured improvisation.","popularity":0.0635,"poster_path":"/iN9QzviJDTfNWpYJZhdXi15zKTi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fall Frum Grace, Miss Pipi's Blue Tale","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1349879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kara Walker","original_name":"Kara Walker","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598ac675925141370601e23b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iN9QzviJDTfNWpYJZhdXi15zKTi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
