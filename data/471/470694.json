While most of them enjoy the meal, one man has a strange reaction: Taking a set of horns off the wall, he attaches them to his head and sets off on a rampage. After destroying the house and terrifying his hostess, her guests, maid, and neighbours, he takes to the streets. The police sends a telegraph to Spain asking for help, and in response a parade of matadors arrive in Paris, ready to slay the crazy beast-man. However, soon after the man-bull fight begins, the errant guest comes to his senses and is taken into custody by waiting policemen.","popularity":0.1235,"poster_path":"/A1JCMhbyA2JCoD9ec775psRVrvi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le monsieur qui a mangé du taureau","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le monsieur qui a mangé du taureau","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Carl","original_name":"Renée Carl","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/xKw1iQS28Z7fMGhbNhNk7gyMkYL.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"59908c37c3a368748102f26c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Bosetti","original_name":"Romeo Bosetti","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/fcIANwE4rSLFdjhlcNVhf8PUkp9.jpg","credit_id":"59908cd3c3a36874730305d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4713224","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/A1JCMhbyA2JCoD9ec775psRVrvi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1909-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Le monsieur qui a mangé du taureau (1909) The Gentleman Who Ate Bull Meat","key":"SBIoHR1Tyx0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-11T06:43:42.000Z","id":"66a8cf0148aff5d36ce0b45e"}]}}}
