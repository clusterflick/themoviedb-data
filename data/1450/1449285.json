Wow! Wubbzy!: The Best Of Walden","overview":"He knows all about science, books and art. And he's Wubbzy's good friend, too! In his first-ever DVD collection, Walden bakes a marshmallow lasagna, gets sick with Chickenitis, plays his hoopty horn for a giant Goo Goo, collects figgety-fig leaves, and keeps a mysterious secret. There are silly dances, a day at the beach, wiggle worms, noodle strudel and a trip to the peak of Mount Zubba Bubba, all with good friends. Come share in Walden's contagious curiosity as he explores Wuzzleburg for non-stop fun, fun, fun!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4J6kutEpZe0GWn3d47iHSnjJrVN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wow!
