But when he finds a mysterious book, \"Magical Rituals and Spells,\" he tries a spell to never go to school again. The next morning, he wakes up to the same day: September 1st. Trapped in a time loop, Timofey must uncover the secrets of the book, face his fears, and learn that some days—and people—are worth repeating.","popularity":0.501,"poster_path":"/7wBKluYHYdVJAGhKWVkhMmLQYQ5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back
