Only three apples tall, they live in mushroom houses and take their morning showers with dewdrops. Papa Smurf, wise beyond his 543 years, gently rules a raucous clan that includes Brainy, Jokey, Clumsy, Vanity, Grouchy, and that luscious femme fatale, Smurfette. But Gargamel, the local wicked wizard, despises the Smurf's happiness. With his fiendish cat, Azrael, Gargamel schemes to capture the Smurfs. Luckily, the Smurf village cannot be found unless a Smurf leads the way, and the Smurfs are as resourceful as they are lovable.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uuj9SbDpCAXAkNxSSlNbTkvLDC4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":300,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Smurfs: Season 1, Vol. One","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uuj9SbDpCAXAkNxSSlNbTkvLDC4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
