An essential characteristic of the lynx is that it hides from view (and from the camera). As a result, Franz Reichle takes a highly imaginative approach to tracking down the animal, including interviews with zoologists, gamekeepers and farmers. The lynx can also be seen as a barometer for ecological balance; ultimately, nature itself becomes the subject of this film","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1990-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lynx","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382674,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Franz Reichle","original_name":"Franz Reichle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5d75a24b7ebc3767bbb2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0392368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
