What strength can we draw on to remedy this? Do we need to re-read Simone Weil, of whom Camus said: “she is the only great spirit of our time”. This documentary retraces the astonishing life of this young middle-class girl of Jewish origin, driven by a thirst for the absolute, who started out in philosophy to go towards God. Simone Weil left no field of thought untouched; she dealt with everything in search of the only truth. As she herself said, “you have to write eternal things to be sure they're topical”. What if we were to talk, with her, about the spirituality of work?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2B0SoHOGBQJDDOdcIDPB3VtfUVt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183510,"logo_path":"/jZGOExPfpUe6vLVU9vaYB0eD7XL.png","name":"KTO TV","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simone Weil, la vie au risque de la vérité","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189926,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simone Weil","original_name":"Simone Weil","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/yYOCgs2z4RKLXpgZt5kBEnP1NBQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67d6ac5731538de608f1a116","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Roqueplo","original_name":"Marguerite Roqueplo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67d6ae9e191868c54ff188b9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Derenne","original_name":"Catherine Derenne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6ac9aebc30a0b48011596","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Derenne","original_name":"Catherine Derenne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6acdf31538de608f1a176","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1902269,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Fredon","original_name":"Anne Fredon","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6aed285d13921b50110f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2B0SoHOGBQJDDOdcIDPB3VtfUVt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
