Recorded at the historical Synchron Stage in Vienna, experience the thrills and swells of the Synchron Stage Orchestra - 48 string, 17 woodwind, 14 brass, 4 percussion - comprised of Austria’s finest instrumentalists, alongside a choir of 39 sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses.  Composed between 1822 and 1824 in Vienna, Symphony No. 9 in D Minor was Beethoven’s final completed symphony. The use of solo singers and a chorus in the final movement was revolutionary, and the emotional journey from the doubt and struggle to the glorious vision of a world of love and tolerance is regarded as one of the greatest and most heartfelt pieces in classical music.","popularity":0.1373,"poster_path":"/kt3gc13N7qoqFGA7lSoJ4QxjnQH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256301,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Air","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Watch the magic of the Synchron Stage Orchestra unfold in the comfort of your home - available now in cinematic quality.","title":"Ludwig van Beethoven's 'Symphony No. 9 in D Minor'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19857614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kt3gc13N7qoqFGA7lSoJ4QxjnQH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":3537,"name":"orchestra"},{"id":254831,"name":"symphony orchestra"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
