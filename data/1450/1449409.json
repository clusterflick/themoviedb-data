The aliens must find this substance quickly and without alerting any of the local life, as they think their encounter will be hostile. Unfortunately , the aliens are led into a gas station on their quest to find this fuel source, and within this shop resides a strange creature known as Dick the Clerk Johnson. Will the aliens be able to fuel their ship unnoticed, or will they get caught and dissected and eaten by the U.S. president? I guess you'll just have to watch the cartoon and find out.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrestrially Challenged","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307774,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Patrik Kancsár","original_name":"Patrik Kancsár","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b5a7ebc30a0b48011889","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307774,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Patrik Kancsár","original_name":"Patrik Kancsár","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b5b2d802309703f144d1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307774,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Patrik Kancsár","original_name":"Patrik Kancsár","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b5bdebc30a0b48011895","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307778,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Peter Bluhme Andersen","original_name":"Peter Bluhme Andersen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b5d4ebc30a0b480118a2","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307778,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Peter Bluhme Andersen","original_name":"Peter Bluhme Andersen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b5ddebc30a0b480118b5","department":"Art","job":"Prop Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307780,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael McGoldrick","original_name":"Michael McGoldrick","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b5eb13d0e96b427bdd7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307796,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jeremy Manuel Peña","original_name":"Jeremy Manuel Peña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b5fed802309703f14503","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Picher","original_name":"Michael Picher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b60dd802309703f14509","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307797,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Antonio J Patiño","original_name":"Antonio J Patiño","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6b622f6b8d57b4a7b9ba8","department":"Art","job":"Painter"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32597604","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Terrestrially Challenged (Short Film)","key":"3kLl-OH4Wns","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-06T21:30:06.000Z","id":"67d6b57ed802309703f144a7"}]}}}
