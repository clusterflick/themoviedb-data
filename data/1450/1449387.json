From martial arts training to everyday life, we follow the protagonist's point of view and a voiceover through various landscapes and tasks. In a public toilet, above the rooftops of Vienna at sunrise, in a trailer park and in a snowy landscape, we are instructed and trained to defend ourselves against a physical attack. “Dirty Care” describes the efforts that non-normative women have to make in order not to be exposed to patriarchal violence or to be capable of standing up to it. The film portrays scenes of empowerment, intimacy, resilience and companionship.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/otPFACewaKsO8MU2ue3jexYK0nv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Essayfilm","title":"Dirty Care","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67d6a9e113d0e96b427bda98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Weber","original_name":"Helen Weber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cat","credit_id":"67d6a9f4ebc30a0b4801147a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6aa45d802309703f1425b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6aa59ebc30a0b48011483","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6aa7a85d13921b5011035","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Hochedlinger","original_name":"Sophia Hochedlinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6aaabebc30a0b480114a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6aac3ebc30a0b480114be","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Katharina Pichler","original_name":"Katharina Pichler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6aae7191868c54ff1879a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3104391,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Susi Dollnig","original_name":"Susi Dollnig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6ab0331538de608f1a0c5","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307722,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tobias Schlorhaufer","original_name":"Tobias Schlorhaufer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6ab2e31538de608f1a0d9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"3D Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307724,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Terz Nervosa","original_name":"Terz Nervosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d6ab5125f01d54167bd97f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2823,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/otPFACewaKsO8MU2ue3jexYK0nv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210281,"name":"sisterhood"},{"id":348641,"name":"dirty care"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Dirty Care by Isa Schieche 2025","key":"1041162033","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-20T16:04:36.000Z","id":"67d6a960f6b8d57b4a7b9b9a"}]}}}
