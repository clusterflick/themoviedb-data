Starting in the walled city of Chester you hop on a train to Llandudno, mosey around a few castles, and take a horse-drawn carriage through Snowdonia. Clearly a holiday for the wealthier set, there's something delightfully intimate about the relationship between the camera and travellers that makes you feel part of the trip. An excellent silent travelogue from skilled producers of the early form.","popularity":0.0496,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":44771,"logo_path":"/bfyrVfFnmmcanicDhqD9PNxbUHw.png","name":"Charles Urban Trading Company","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wales, England: Land of Castles and Waterfalls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Picturesque North Wales: Land of Castles and Waterfalls","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3599168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
