He waits on customers, settles disputes and \"pinch-hits\" as barber in the store's shop. He is busy waiting on customers when an inebriated gentleman comes in and demands attention. He asks whether Al has any dry herring, and when Al admits having some, he tells Al to give them a drink. Then he walks out, leaving Al amazed. In a few minutes the same customer enters again and wants to see some canned peaches. Al hands him a can but he insists upon seeing the can that forms the keystone of a big and wonderful looking pile of cans. Al takes this can out of the pile which falls in a wreck on the floor-and the customer then decides that it is the wrong brand. The village smart aleck enters and tries to mooch a few cookies out of a barrel. But Al has had experience with grocery store loungers before and fixes up a mousetrap which discourages the cookie-mooching habit.","popularity":0.1774,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack White","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High Spots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al St. John","original_name":"Al St. John","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/u6jepFCiItOjfo9wP3yU2ZLZFgE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Clerk","credit_id":"67d5b063191868c54ff160fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Cavender","original_name":"Glen Cavender","popularity":0.3429,"profile_path":"/mkCWTmyWtInbtNiSkBaUU20DgXz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Smart Aleck","credit_id":"67d5b073191868c54ff16117","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clem Beauchamp","original_name":"Clem Beauchamp","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/tQCsQCOKSlSZfDyJPzcq99QYfsl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Nut","credit_id":"67d5b08324b7ebc3767bb3fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estelle Bradley","original_name":"Estelle Bradley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Proprietor's Daughter","credit_id":"67d5b09224b7ebc3767bb403","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":178321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lloyd","original_name":"Jack Lloyd","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/7awYfJwMn2w6ehj8s9bnwPNC499.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Proprietor","credit_id":"67d5b0a15963ebffde7bc6df","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elfie Fay","original_name":"Elfie Fay","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67d5b0ab0525f3d74f013c72","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Roberts","original_name":"Stephen Roberts","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5afcd31538de608f17c7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0474091","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
