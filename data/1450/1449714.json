Of his two daughters, one still lives with him whilst the other has become ultra-orthodox. The relationship with his immediate family is complex, as is the one with his grandchildren and the other locals in the community which, over the years, has grown increasingly religious. It is a drought year and Abraham, for whom working the field is his whole life, finds himself at a critical juncture: he stands to lose everything – his livelihood, his family; even his hatred of God which is keeping him alive. In this time of crisis, he is left with no choice but to seek out the same God whom he had forsaken; and pray.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5e7FOinngzpSHbrZQ2OiTgS391M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wasserman: The Rain Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yosef Carmon","original_name":"Yosef Carmon","popularity":0.1534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"וסרמן","credit_id":"67d7525785d13921b50137a4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1443816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Idit Shehori","original_name":"Idit Shehori","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d7521d25f01d54167bff72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1095707,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Akerman","original_name":"David Akerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d7522ef6b8d57b4a7bbaf3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7061170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5e7FOinngzpSHbrZQ2OiTgS391M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
