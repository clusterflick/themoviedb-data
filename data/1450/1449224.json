See The Smurfs for the first time, or for the first time in years. Skip along with all 101 mushroom-dwelling, sing-song Smurfs as they search the forest for truffles and try -- try -- to stay out of trouble. From the creative goldmine of Hanna-Barbera and nominated for an EmmyÂ® Award for Outstanding Animated Series, the Smurfs may only stand three-apples high, but their adventures stand the test of time. Now, 20 of their lovable adventures have been remastered and made available for the first time. We all know what the Smurfs would say about that: \"Smurfy!\" So join these small, blue creatures with the descriptive names (Brainy, Hefty, Jokey and, of course, Papa Smurf) as they sing and parade through the forest, avoiding -- and outwitting -- the wicked wizard Gargamel and his equally evil cat, Azrael.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pClCr6NLJNjA6f1J2bfZL7cg9KB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":319,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Smurfs: Season 1, Vol. 2","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pClCr6NLJNjA6f1J2bfZL7cg9KB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
