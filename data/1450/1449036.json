But what if we could hold it for a moment? \"Capturing Memories\" is a dive into the essence of the inconsistent, an invitation to reflect on the importance of preserving moments before they are lost in oblivion. Through visual fragments, the documentary reveals how small scenes of everyday life carry echoes of the past and seeds of the future. In a world where everything passes, what really remains? This film is a tribute to the art of immortalizing the moment, to the beauty of seeing beyond the present and to the need to give meaning to what may one day become a memory.","popularity":0.3349,"poster_path":"/i1onR1ozg4Nr4ta9t8nT6J1sRuF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucas Duarte Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2027-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"Documentary, Brazilian Cinema","title":"Capturing Memories","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Capturando Memórias","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Capturing Memories","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Capturando Recuerdos","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Capturer des Souvenirs","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Catturando Ricordi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucas Duarte","original_name":"Lucas Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3sW6iTc1P7ZbSMyUhteiHw8xYWR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67d5c1b031538de608f180b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucas Duarte","original_name":"Lucas Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3sW6iTc1P7ZbSMyUhteiHw8xYWR.jpg","credit_id":"67d5c1c931678cc3f801416e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucas Duarte","original_name":"Lucas Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3sW6iTc1P7ZbSMyUhteiHw8xYWR.jpg","credit_id":"67d5c1e613d0e96b427bb02f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucas Duarte","original_name":"Lucas Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3sW6iTc1P7ZbSMyUhteiHw8xYWR.jpg","credit_id":"67d5c1f731538de608f180d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucas Duarte","original_name":"Lucas Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3sW6iTc1P7ZbSMyUhteiHw8xYWR.jpg","credit_id":"67d5c20731678cc3f8014172","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/i1onR1ozg4Nr4ta9t8nT6J1sRuF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"},{"id":264118,"name":"brazil"},{"id":269412,"name":"poetic documentary"},{"id":279389,"name":"brazilian cinema"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2027-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2028-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Teaser //  Capturing Memories","key":"1066743786","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-17T21:59:39.000Z","id":"67d8bd017b4be4f26ca73062"}]}}}
