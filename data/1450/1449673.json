The ten chapters explore meanings both domestic and communal. Home is a domicile, a community, a geography, and an ideology. The film collages heterogeneous media sources like 8mm home movies, stop motion, direct animation, and archival sound to construct layers of feeling within the frame and throughout the soundtrack. 'Annie, wake up' creates a reflective space that is sometimes brooding, sometimes miraculous, perhaps both.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6IzF4d4YDxaWSYaI2hFtbDVTgp5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Home is more than a domicile.
