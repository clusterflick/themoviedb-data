Each morning, schools in Canada play the national anthem, and all students are expected to stand. In protest of the injustices that her people have faced throughout the history of Canada, Miyawata sits down instead. But will she be able to persuade the head teacher to change the schoolâ€™s land rights acknowledgement?  Miyawata is also the organiser of school climate strikes in her hometown. The climate movement in Winnipeg had enormous momentum until Covid hit, and now that the end of the pandemic is in sight, she wants to get the movement going again.","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":"/vX7XCISya0uLLeyZwlxreMvUBcB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tigerlily Two Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Won't Stand For It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712841,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikki Parrott","original_name":"Nikki Parrott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d722bcd802309703f16248","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1392435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Funk","original_name":"Tyler Funk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/tTI4WNHDduKnPSts1Z2k1S1gIGi.jpg","credit_id":"67d722d431678cc3f8018277","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998412,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ewan Denny","original_name":"Ewan Denny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d722e4577665ace5f1b6e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265880,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ashley Catherine Dick","original_name":"Ashley Catherine Dick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d722f513d0e96b427bfa75","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caroline Bacle","original_name":"Caroline Bacle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d8c0f2c4c2b520a08597d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33241994","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vX7XCISya0uLLeyZwlxreMvUBcB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
