To everyone's surprise, Burdette loses HIS fortune to Jimmie, including his estate in Long Island, NY. Stunned, Burdette wanders aimlessly through a forest and trips over a rock, sustaining a head injury. A feeble-minded local named \"Curio\" Johnson finds Burdette and takes him to his cabin, for some company. Meanwhile, Jimmie--under the impression that a depressed Burdette has killed himself--goes to New York to inspect his new \"estate\" and meets Burdette's daughter, Cynthia. The girl, however, mistakes him for a new chauffeur. Complications ensue.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72476,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paralta Plays Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Turn of a Card","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
