It captures nostalgic memories shaped by colonial history, using bamboo scaffolding to represent societal changes and mirrors to reflect surface-level modernity, hinting at deeper identity questions. The narrative weaves together collective memories and personal stories, contrasting the historical event of the queen's visit with a young woman's reflections on her past relationship. This intermingling of narratives invites viewers to explore the fluidity of identity and the evolving essence of Hong Kong amid tensions between progress and tradition.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/51s6a5RC4tdVysRc2j16eWPMjNz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100287,"logo_path":null,"name":"School of Design, Hong Kong Polytechnic University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2025-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcolonial Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5771916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","original_name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcb6948b9e1d0169275891","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5771916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","original_name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcb8aae8fa3cfe3f2aa1b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5771916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","original_name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcb8b62af12f9da7eaa64c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5771916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","original_name":"Zack Sit Hok Shing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcb8c1f57d1caf913bf36e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5771938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yip Tsz Yau","original_name":"Yip Tsz Yau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcbc77f9ca7fc67ffb67f3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1372,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6hYwAshJzVKY5vMeT2nXi0wRrpe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2443},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1372,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qDAtUhpVti7DrH3OiLpIc43Hz5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2443},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1372,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1SsZgo5ZilfFt49QAXTPNJYmMav.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2443}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/51s6a5RC4tdVysRc2j16eWPMjNz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1068}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235797,"name":"dance film"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Hong Kong Asian Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Jumping Frames - Hong Kong International Movement-image Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Postcolonial Queen | Trailer","key":"iVDNaAybYMg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-23T09:44:59.000Z","id":"68fcb2c82e8c1820cebbeb74"}]}}}
