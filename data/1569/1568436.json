Though his career has recently taken off, Reznik is haunted by the fear of terminal illness and that his days are numbered.  As he house-sits for a fellow photographer in Astoria, Queens, Reznik finds himself compelled to delve into his most forbidden fascination: vore, the macabre practice of consuming another human being alive. The weight of this dark desire lingers in the air around him like a heavy fog, as he struggles to come to terms with it before it consumes him completely.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Disorderly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5370213,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hans Lam Barboza","original_name":"Hans Lam Barboza","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Elliot Reznik","credit_id":"68fc342742da8c1092275687","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5771326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Malkiewicz","original_name":"Mike Malkiewicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bel Aire","credit_id":"68fc3447b55e911b006a72b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4673018,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jack F.
