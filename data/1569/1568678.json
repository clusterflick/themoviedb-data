Born in Valparaíso in 1923, Francia practiced medicine throughout his life, specializing in pediatrics. However, he had an intense film career that, although it ended abruptly with the 1973 coup d'état, left its mark on Chilean filmmaking in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1962, he founded the Viña del Mar Film Club, which a few years later would become the University of Chile's Film School in Valparaíso. A key driving force behind the Viña del Mar film festivals, his name is primarily associated with one of the greatest works of Chilean cinema, Valparaíso, My Love (1969).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sAc38Cxq5Rm7AMxtLz8nWcR83K8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"1994-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aldo Francia: Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano en Viña del Mar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcia Orell García","original_name":"Marcia Orell García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcec63c6f47d6cff9fa922","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcia Orell García","original_name":"Marcia Orell García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcec723474360a26fb69fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcia Orell García","original_name":"Marcia Orell García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcec7fe356753ca92aa2a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772184,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marianela Astudillo","original_name":"Marianela Astudillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcec98e356753ca92aa2af","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Poldy Valenzuela","original_name":"Poldy Valenzuela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcecb79b321f4263fb6999","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772186,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hugo Galvez","original_name":"Hugo Galvez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcecc75947eca268fb6a79","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772188,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fabrizzio De Negri","original_name":"Fabrizzio De Negri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcecf3c09fe0668b9fa923","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1434,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sAc38Cxq5Rm7AMxtLz8nWcR83K8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":956}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
