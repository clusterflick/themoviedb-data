Immediately afterwards, his supporters went to the monument that President Putin himself unveiled in 2017 for the victims of Stalin’s political oppression. The large crowds laid flowers, which were instantly removed by police. Over time, the commemorations continued and merged with opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Arrests followed, and peaceful protest has been brutally suppressed. Among the demonstrators is Alyona, a young woman with blonde curls and a pink coat. She refuses to be silenced by police batons and is taken away. Facing absurd charges, she must undergo a trial and risk an excessively harsh sentence. Her terrified mother begs her to passively endure the political repression, and avoid getting into further trouble.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When I Get Jailed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
