They have managed to complete their university studies in Tehran, from where they take a train back to their home village. The film Safar accompanies them throughout this journey in the intimate space of a train compartment. This ordinary journey, with no particular geographical landmarks, gradually turns into a journey of self-discovery, with each woman reflecting on her life and taking stock with disconcerting lucidity. As the landscape rolls by outside the window, three life stories unfold, filled with dreams and desires as well as hesitation and uncertainty.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
