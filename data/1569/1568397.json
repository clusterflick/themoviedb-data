In September 1966, New York University's Clinic for Learning, backed by a Ford Foundation grant, began an educational rehabilitation program at the school. The object: to reach apparently unreachable and disinterested students before they become drop-outs. Cameras look in on a seventh grade class, observing new approaches to working with disadvantaged youngsters: challenging students to be more aggressive in their studies; permitting class members to hold arguments pertaining to their lessons; and attempting to establish more personal contact between teachers and students.There are also problems. Discipline is poor among the students, who must be taught to have respect for themselves and for the education they can get.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/koZXvXiQQdJ79C1lOhhbo9S9gP9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way It Is","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5771206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard McCutchon","original_name":"Richard McCutchon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narartor","credit_id":"68fc136cb309e5bae29fa6e0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":991684,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeri Sopanen","original_name":"Jeri Sopanen","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fc1462aaea332036926949","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Mayer","original_name":"Harold Mayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fc14728c6406fd797949f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5771215,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zena Voynow","original_name":"Zena Voynow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fc1487cd4a8ddb15fb669c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Mayer","original_name":"Harold Mayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fc14a331576054c310f43e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5771218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lynne Rhodes Mayer","original_name":"Lynne Rhodes Mayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fc14d10efece086a9fc341","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2377251","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/koZXvXiQQdJ79C1lOhhbo9S9gP9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1967-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
