Over the course of two years, the production team ventured deep into primeval forests, using fungi as the narrative focus. Through the lens of a one-square-meter habitat, the ocean on land, and the concept of fungi giving rise to all things, the documentary gradually unveils the mysteries of the fungal kingdom from point, line, to plane, presenting a systematic and holistic perspective. It tells the story of the habitats within national parksâ€”their ecology, the endless cycle of life, their diverse and fantastical nature, as well as the indispensable role fungi play in the ecosystem's cycle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"documentary","title":"Fungi Kingdom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
