Resolved to recover her fortune in the easiest manner possible, Norma poses as the wife of her silly but wealthy suitor, Cuthbert Van Zelt, and soon she is invited to a number of lavish social affairs. At one such party, Norma steals the Duke of Duffield's family jewels but replaces them upon learning that they are made of paste. Next, she bets the duke that his jewels are fake and thereby wins a large sum of money. The duke persuades Norma to secure some old love letters from the man who is blackmailing him, Emerson Trent. After accomplishing this task, Norma discovers that Trent is not only the man who ruined her father, but the uncle of the man she loves, Oliver Garrett. Impressed by her courage, Trent promises to make amends, and Norma, her financial worries ended, marries Oliver.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164069,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bessie Barriscale Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All of a Sudden Norma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1371716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Barriscale","original_name":"Bessie Barriscale","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/ajsGYDEx28oG76cK4WibgdgtyDt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Norma Brisbane","credit_id":"68fc07d4af9dcac57f9fc32a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
