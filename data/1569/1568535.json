The search for ancient power begins as they use an 'explores warp scroll' and defeat a dragon (the Sea Serpent), acquiring the first Legendary Blessed Eye (an Ender Eye mask) which is capable of summoning minions. The journey takes them into the Bumble Zone, where they encounter a 'rat compressor' and an Ice Dragon which is quickly destroyed by their weaponry. Despite being turned into a vampire and needing an Altar of Cleansing, Lachlan demonstrates the \"engineer mindset\" by experimenting with bizarre technology, including the Meat Shredder, Mechanical Fusion Anvil, and a whoopy cushion. After searching for the Ancient Remnant, the episode concludes with the discovery of 10-armor plating and a successful ride atop the previously hostile dragon.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oUB5glJuFWfQMaJlkjKiJaVu0ET.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":67,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Key lies in the Quest Book","title":"Lachlan's Lovely World Rebooted: Episode 3: Eye Spy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1eH2ndNRAHG2NRsf4S1mjlk5E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oUB5glJuFWfQMaJlkjKiJaVu0ET.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
