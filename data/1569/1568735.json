Through these recollections, Devenir traces his painful passage into adulthood and entry into a society that rejects difference. The film explores how fear, shame, and internalized oppression shaped his sense of self, turning social hostility into a private wound. It becomes a journey into the world of the “Other,” revealing how living under constant threat transforms one’s inner life, yet ultimately contributes to the formation of identity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/78quWr7OVlqMHXnIs9qkin43NU8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devenir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Devenir, autour de quatre souvenirs de jeunesse d’un vieil homosexuel de la province française","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"FR","iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/78quWr7OVlqMHXnIs9qkin43NU8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
