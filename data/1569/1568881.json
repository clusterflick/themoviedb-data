After an operation restores her sight, Laura is disillusioned and embittered by the sordidness of her environment. She falls under the evil influence of the gang's leader, Dennis Sullivan, who teaches her the art of safecracking. Just as Laura is about to perform her first job, her three benefactors are released from jail because of insufficient evidence and rush to the scene of the robbery to prevent Laura's corruption. The owner of the safe gives the four a ranch in reward for thwarting the robbery, and they all start a new life in the West.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zaJm5gyB8qhgsyDo4Pk1YN09C3J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyes of the Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.482,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"68fd4f877ac8cfb7b7275b6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Burns","original_name":"Edmund Burns","popularity":0.4335,"profile_path":"/nm91OSyVUWeegGhh1yCuwkpj7a8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mike Hogan","credit_id":"68fd4ff088566afd95275c44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Littlefield","original_name":"Lucien Littlefield","popularity":0.7024,"profile_path":"/65jnSJmU2BC4Jrpg2Nfg6glU6wN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Whitey","credit_id":"68fd501767ed119f56275cae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Midgley","original_name":"Florence Midgley","popularity":0.596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sal","credit_id":"68fd507477a09bb710fb6c00","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burton Law","original_name":"Burton Law","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/1Bn1if7PS8BhVp7UNckOqtMZFoQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"68fd509cd927b68bb0926e53","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cook","original_name":"John Cook","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"John Dunn","credit_id":"68fd5111c063bd436d3bf652","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.A.
