As his friends move on with their lives, he must repeat his final year, haunted by the fear that this may be their last summer together. His best friend Finn drifts away, and Noah’s relationship with his on-and-off girlfriend Maja falters as she flirts with others. The group’s hot, hazy summer of skating and drinking unravels when a shady photographer lures them into a morally dubious situation. Humiliated and isolated, Noah’s anxieties and longing for connection surface—but in an unexpected twist, he finds fragile comfort in the very man who exposed him, a photographer grappling with his own past losses.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tFkRA9bE6Wn2XNUvIx0wnYoNnJU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If June Never Fades","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
