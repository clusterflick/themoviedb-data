Disguised and hiding out in the steerage of a boat, Yvonne meets violinist Luigi. She dances to Luigi's accompaniment in a Greenwich Village cabaret, where she is discovered by David Marston, the producer who had negotiated to bring the famous Yvonne to America. Marston signs the supposed unknown performer and intends to bill her under the name of Yvonne, whom he believes has broken her contract with him. Apache dancer Cecile claims to be the real Yvonne, but matters are straightened out with the arrival of Aunt Marie. Yvonne marries Lawrence Bartlett, the author of the play that features her in America.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/h6IPW6KXi1c81DagSdmXtZDWNh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7486,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yvonne from Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.482,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Yvonne Halbert","credit_id":"68fcbf76f95776b5e8938549","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Forrest","original_name":"Allan Forrest","popularity":0.3468,"profile_path":"/jhGHhMlLlprXT3VBQuvVHFw9Ht1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lawrence Bartlett","credit_id":"68fcbfa0f5295e9dfa2aa1cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Lewis","original_name":"Vera Lewis","popularity":0.5525,"profile_path":"/2mKt5b7EAPEjvRFbUHzTD8oGoxV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aunt Marie Provost","credit_id":"68fcbfc40a89ba2a7afb68c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
