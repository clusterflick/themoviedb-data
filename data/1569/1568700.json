Told through fragmented imagery and sparse narration, the film meditates on grief, lost potential, and the quiet ache of what might have been. A portrait of a man haunted equally by war itself than by the tenderness he abandoned.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bxaM9vf29WIRL7OgrcxRJGqqa2d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the ashes, a memory breathes.","title":"ashesknowpeace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Webb","original_name":"Michael Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcf7efc063bd436d3bf4cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Webb","original_name":"Michael Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcf83366e6702088275b44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Webb","original_name":"Michael Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcf84adab517c555275976","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5772258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Webb","original_name":"Michael Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fcf86947f925a8e03bf5a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bxaM9vf29WIRL7OgrcxRJGqqa2d.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bnTa2no3CvhCO381FQNGHBQxrnW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
