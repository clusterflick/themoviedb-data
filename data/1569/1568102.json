The father dies and leaves his son papers that could convict the rest of his gang of henchmen. John falls in love with Frances, the daughter of Armitage, another politician. Frances is not interested in John, but marries him to save her father from exposure. The gang tries to get the papers away from John, who has taken his wife back to the woods. When John exposes the crooked politicians, including his own father, he wins Frances' respect and love. John staves off the revengeful ward gangsters with a single gun until Frances rounds up the other lumberjacks who come to his rescue.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rough Neck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Apfel","original_name":"Oscar Apfel","popularity":0.6359,"profile_path":"/1HxUEleoPk99JVDqzEDzaljMLih.jpg","credit_id":"68fb7ba92ec0801b0d094831","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010644","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1919-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
