Resnais’ film, on the surface a documentary portrait of the National Library of France, has commonly been understood as a meditation on the crisis of memory, knowledge and ethics after the horrors of World War II. Toute la data du monde takes some of Resnais’ images and questions as inspiration and applies them to this new current crisis of memory, knowledge and archivization in the age of AI. Through surreal, meditative and entirely AI-generated images, it suggests what the libraries of artificial intelligence and data might look like.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toute la data du monde","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5129659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evelyn Kreutzer","original_name":"Evelyn Kreutzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fd4c24f1e8924a339fab77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
