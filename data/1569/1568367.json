Within a shifting frame, cut-out fragments of animals and humans slip in and out of view, forming and unforming as creatures that vomit, expel, and rearrange their own parts. The work resists stable form, instead embracing mutation, rupture, and play as its guiding principles. The soundtrack is composed by artist-musician duo Diane Christiansen and Steve Dawson with an exuberantly eclectic, “everything but the kitchen sink” sensibility, that mirrors this unruly choreography—layering clamor, rhythm, and unexpected sonic textures. Together, image and sound conjure a surreal pageant of grotesque humor and unsettling vitality, where the boundaries between species, bodies, and objects dissolve into a restless state of becoming.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Now That I've Lost My Buffalo, I Don't Know Who To Grind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessie Mott","original_name":"Jessie Mott","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fbfeb570ea4481d6701967","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5771112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandra Trigoso","original_name":"Alejandra Trigoso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fbfef49d2ad5dd9ebbe982","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diane Christiansen","original_name":"Diane Christiansen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fbfefecd4a8ddb15fb6610","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
