When John learns that Fairchild secretly paid for his education, he tries to repay him, but the proud Fairchild refuses. John marries Fairchild's daughter Eleanor, with whom he is infatuated, so that Fairchild can benefit, although Eleanor marries only for the half-million dollars involved. After Whipple returns and pursues Eleanor, John offers her a divorce if she will sign the money over to her father. When Whipple makes her suspect that John loves a young widow, Eleanor writes a note of farewell and leaves, but she is stopped by Whipple, who wanting to elope, embraces her. When John sees this and fights Whipple, Eleanor shields John from a bullet and is wounded. She recovers, and, learning that John loves her, declares her love.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Steel King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Apfel","original_name":"Oscar Apfel","popularity":0.6359,"profile_path":"/1HxUEleoPk99JVDqzEDzaljMLih.jpg","credit_id":"68fc00daa28d1498419fc322","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0011733","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1919-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
