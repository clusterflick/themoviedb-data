Supported by a montage of archival material, the film told their story, which was shaped by the dictatorship under Salazar. Now, a quarter of a century later, De Sousa Dias returns with a sequel that questions and reflects on her earlier film. She describes how she first encountered the archive material that led her to the sisters’ story in the early 1990s.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Post Criminal Case","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","original_name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fbbe14241712b24904f98a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam","release_date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
