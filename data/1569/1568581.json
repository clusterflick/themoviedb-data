Upon leaving the restaurant, he accidentally takes the overcoat of antique jewelry dealer Grayson Blair. When Phyllis is unable to pay her bill, Grayson, attracted to her, picks up the check, but after he arrives home and discovers that a valuable Hindu necklace he had stored in his coat pocket is missing, he suspects Phyllis as the crook. Dressing up in her brother's clothes, Phyllis finds the necklace, suspects her brother, and seeks out Grayson, whom she has discovered to be the jewel's owner. After a series of mix-ups during which Rhi, who has been trailing the necklace to return it to the Hindu idol from which it was stolen, tries unsuccessfully to kill Grayson, the overcoat is recognized, everything is cleared up, and Grayson and Phyllis become engaged.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7486,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bit of Jade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.482,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Phyllis King","credit_id":"68fcc49a07b661f626275943","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Forrest","original_name":"Allan Forrest","popularity":0.3468,"profile_path":"/jhGHhMlLlprXT3VBQuvVHFw9Ht1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Grayson Blair","credit_id":"68fcc4c1d13717ce402aa215","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1089913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Howard","original_name":"David Howard","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Cuthbert King","credit_id":"68fcc4fd851733089e926d26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Lewis","original_name":"Vera Lewis","popularity":0.5525,"profile_path":"/2mKt5b7EAPEjvRFbUHzTD8oGoxV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Abigail King","credit_id":"68fcc5291d088d944dfb68ef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Ferguson","original_name":"Al Ferguson","popularity":0.4635,"profile_path":"/pqsu8OuPrGPMwuvvPsL1cVMzEMr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rhi","credit_id":"68fcc55fe4dee033299fa7f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":1.6042,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Lantz","credit_id":"68fcc583a96c68e96d93855c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Sloman","original_name":"Edward Sloman","popularity":0.4508,"profile_path":"/8NpMGdBGVMvZOzig3Jj3dwvRRQM.jpg","credit_id":"68fcc42bd3bdef8364bbeca3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400020,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karl R.
