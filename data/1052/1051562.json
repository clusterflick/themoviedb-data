Unable to go through with this meeting, she takes refuge, clandestinely, in the house of an elderly couple. A dramatic event changes everything and forces Anna to forge an impromptu relationship with Victorine (Louise Turcot). The strange cohabitation of these two women will help them find the courage to face their trials.","popularity":0.2853,"poster_path":"/nG872mnqLtbT35C4xLBWWAmyX5R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115328,"logo_path":"/aMsQQKo26BKOVoC4h25ltJoQ50j.png","name":"Bellefeuille
