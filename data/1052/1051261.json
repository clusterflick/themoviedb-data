This is an American documentary of Argentina commissioned by the Philadelphia department of education in 1969, it contrasts city and suburban life in Argentina through scenes of gauchos and ranch life, scientific farming methods, and examples of Spanish architecture and furnishings.This film was manipulated by dying it, sewing on it and combining it with an original 16mm film.
