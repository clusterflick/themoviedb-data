Bill's Run: A Political Journey In Rural Kansas captures Bill's journey through the primary, a comical and sometimes painful quest of quixotic proportions, as he takes on the Republican incumbent and fights to preserve a lifestyle quickly disappearing from rural America. A strong supporter was his mother, former U.S. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, who proved both a rose and a thorn to his campaign. The exciting outcome shows, once again, that every vote counts.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill’s Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bill's Run: A Political Journey in Rural Kansas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706754,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Kassebaum","original_name":"Richard Kassebaum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c6001bcf8c9007c066403","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0426985","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bill's Run: A Political Journey in Rural Kansas - Trailer - POV 2004 | PBS","key":"7NWnHG-CH90","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2014-12-18T22:22:48.000Z","id":"6500da04d7dcd2011c60820b"}]}}}
