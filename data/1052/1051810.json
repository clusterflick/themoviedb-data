Since being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, those moments on the ice were the only times the strong and confident man in him reappeared. The arena deserted, his wife France offers him one last chance to be the young hockey player again, one last time around. And now, on this icy stage, the love of her life re-emerges, reliving his moments of glory. The game was his life; his very existence passed through the connection between skate and surface. As he takes his final lap, he savors every moment. From the echoing sounds of this empty arena emerges an unaffected younger man. Alone in the stands, France shares her husband’s emotions. Because with the coming darkness, this is her time to say goodbye as well.","popularity":0.1198,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":186779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Production les Insolents","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LAST TIME AROUND","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Parizeau","original_name":"Sophie Parizeau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c19a69a358d0091515234","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936319,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Asselin","original_name":"Steve Asselin","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c19f4d2b20900d6a0e1be","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Tomassini","original_name":"David Tomassini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c1976d2b2090093b98514","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797638,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yvan Thibodeau","original_name":"Yvan Thibodeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c19e907faa200e3e63903","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638258,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Guillaume Couture","original_name":"Guillaume Couture","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c19dc156cc700ca0308af","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vicky Bounadère","original_name":"Vicky Bounadère","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c19b3bb260200e3da336c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Tomassini","original_name":"David Tomassini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c19cf105611008ad99ec2","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
