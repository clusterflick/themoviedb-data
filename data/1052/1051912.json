They lead typical American lives: they have children, pursue successful middle-class careers, and live in the suburbs. If you did business with any of them over the phone, you would probably have no reason to suspect they are anything but typical. If you were to meet them, however, you'd be surprised to find that they are all dwarfs, with the exception of John Lizzo, the tall, rangy fellow who married Karla.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Enough","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Krawitz","original_name":"Jan Krawitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c5bf5d2b20900f3bf3e2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0398768","wikidata_id":"Q4905654","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
