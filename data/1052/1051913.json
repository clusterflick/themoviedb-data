One year later, O'Neal fled the charge, and for over 30 years, he has lived in Tanzania as one of the last American exiles from an era when activists considered themselves at war with the U.S. government. Today, this community organizer confronts very different challenges and finds himself living between two worlds â€” America and Africa, his radical past and his uncertain future.","popularity":0.5622,"poster_path":"/kMUvXuZ1unmQnwUuaZjOlhOVIkF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Panther in Africa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Matthews","original_name":"Aaron Matthews","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c5cc1bb260200b1a7b61e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0910747","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMUvXuZ1unmQnwUuaZjOlhOVIkF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
