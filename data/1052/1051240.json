Using only 35mm analogue camera. Some of the photos are archival photos during the production of GMIII: Essay 23-28 (short film project) while several other are taken in a nauseous state. During the state, the photos are barely planned and to be thought of, in resulting a pure sporadic irregular experimentation of black and white medium. An attempt of visualization the concept of duality (black (+) white) and human irrational yet vivid visual of sickness.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nauseous","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3795597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bayu Kusuma","original_name":"Bayu Kusuma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637a8f5bf056d50079bff559","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
