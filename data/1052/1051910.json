Ex-cop Brenda Kitterman and environmentalist Mike Raiman wanted to do something to address the local tensions, but the community was torn. Many residents were losing their jobs in timber and mining, and blamed environmentalists. Adding fuel to the fire was a radio talk show host who declared environmentalists \"an enemy... to be annihilated.\" Over a stormy two-year period, The Fire Next Time follows a deeply divided group of Montana citizens caught in a web of conflicts intensified by rapid growth and the power of talk radio.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fire Next Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrice O'Neill","original_name":"Patrice O'Neill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637c5b20b2e07401949e4e7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0932139","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
