Designed for the vital role of reconnaissance, they ranged ahead of the advancing Panzer spearheads to assess enemy strengths and intentions. Whether on four wheels or employing the more distinctive eight wheel configuration, German armoured cars would be seen as much a symbol of the Blitzkrieg as the Panzers themselves. This programme covers all these vehicles and includes rare footage of the late war 'Puma' armoured car in Normandy.","popularity":0.0496,"poster_path":"/fw1l6FYTuGZPhKKJ0TT3pglBrYh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"German Military Vehicles","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":909,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fw1l6FYTuGZPhKKJ0TT3pglBrYh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":604}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
