Chaim, from the Chabad Lubavitch community in Crown Heights, starts his journey reading the anti-homosexuality verse for his Bar Mitzvah and ends it by defeating the conversion therapy group JONAH in court, proving them of fraud. Lieba starts her journey by converting into Jewish orthodoxy and moving to New York to study at Yeshiva University and ends it by falling in love with a woman and having a coming out party. Chaim and Lieba's stories are contrasted with the Orthodox perspective with interviews and scenes from the community themselves.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1rU5WNJSikXQzXeJukrMZmsFubW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queer and Frum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chaim Levin","original_name":"Chaim Levin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d698e83dc31300864b0798","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lieba Swartz-Brownstein","original_name":"Lieba Swartz-Brownstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d698f4c15b55008e43d7cc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3796974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miki Katoni","original_name":"Miki Katoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637b9ff363aad200762022e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3796974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miki Katoni","original_name":"Miki Katoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6983222df2e00df3d76d9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897003,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Tensuan","original_name":"James Tensuan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6985712b10e00b5712ba1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897003,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Tensuan","original_name":"James Tensuan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6984d22df2e0079769d66","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3796974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miki Katoni","original_name":"Miki Katoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6982c3dc313008231d87b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897004,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Vega","original_name":"Alan Vega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6986d12b10e007b775c64","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897006,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Wasserman","original_name":"James Wasserman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6988912b10e00851c300b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032491,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Steven Wetrich","original_name":"Steven Wetrich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d6989a955c65008c7a6929","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23180942","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"queerandfrumdoc","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1rU5WNJSikXQzXeJukrMZmsFubW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Queer & Frum short film, audience feedback Nov. 2022 LGBTQ+ Toronto Festival","key":"6sKOqWYn8GI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-20T16:49:51.000Z","id":"63d6922222df2e00797699dc"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DOC LA - Queer And Frum","key":"754921785","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-28T23:18:52.000Z","id":"63d69211c15b550079fb19cf"}]}}}
