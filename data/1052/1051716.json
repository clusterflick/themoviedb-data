Out of all the candidates he picks Daniel, seemingly the least suitable for the job, a young loser immersed in virtual games. Jacob teaches him 'the ancient art' of dog walking; the lessons are a funny, absurd mixture of memory, history, and fantasy. - Manhattan Odyssey is an unusual 'love story' between two men, a woman and a dog, if it is love story at all. It leads us from an everyday activity such as a dog walking to the liminal space of the human animal becoming either animal or human.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":"/xeVkyXgCCxTEmqVvGH5hbqQTumV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Senka Božić","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manhattan Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zdenko Jelčić","original_name":"Zdenko Jelčić","popularity":0.1688,"profile_path":"/kR5OBOR2jNwpB1GkxpHuyNJejX3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jakov","credit_id":"637bff844fd1410082c59e08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mladen Vujčić","original_name":"Mladen Vujčić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"637bff8e38469a00b4b96852","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Cerovečki","original_name":"Marta Cerovečki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nikolina","credit_id":"637c000ce263bb00844cc5da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Cvitaš","original_name":"Ana Cvitaš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c0016ce6c4c00cee8e911","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iva Peter Dragan","original_name":"Iva Peter Dragan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c0024ce6c4c007f17a207","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marija Cvitaš","original_name":"Marija Cvitaš","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c002f006eee0083990dd2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karla Lebhaft","original_name":"Karla Lebhaft","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c003855937b00cd9824a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Orlić","original_name":"Olga Orlić","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c004038469a00b4b9686e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matea Božić","original_name":"Matea Božić","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c004a88b14800ab99841f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoran Beroš","original_name":"Zoran Beroš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c0053006eee009587190d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4428199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dusko Petrovic","original_name":"Dusko Petrovic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"6579ea6ba1d33200febe7ac0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filip Dubrovski","original_name":"Filip Dubrovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"637c006a88b14800c8b461f7","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797478,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mario Vrbančić","original_name":"Mario Vrbančić","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637bff6c38469a007594ca2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797478,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mario Vrbančić","original_name":"Mario Vrbančić","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637bff7188b148008e823ec1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12922900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xeVkyXgCCxTEmqVvGH5hbqQTumV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
