Once in his room, he listens again to a voice message on his cell phone: his lover tells him she is breaking up with him; he is not spontaneous; she has found someone else; don't call. He throws his phone down. When he reaches beneath the bed to retrieve it, he finds a Polaroid photograph of a partially nude woman posed provocatively; it includes a phone number and a sexual question. He opens a beer and stares at the photo. If he calls, what then?","popularity":0.2508,"poster_path":"/pAHA6ek2bNWTj77J71M1W3mvcdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Business Trip","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Canet","original_name":"Guillaume Canet","popularity":1.448,"profile_path":"/yxerAhXValEezb1EuV9XWc9L8KC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jean-Paul Clément","credit_id":"52fe48db9251416c9109a8f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mélanie Laurent","original_name":"Mélanie Laurent","popularity":2.4478,"profile_path":"/i99ogEo4gQyanCmHWYYoS6hsUqL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Réceptioniste de Hôtel","credit_id":"52fe48db9251416c9109a8f7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Ellis","original_name":"Sean Ellis","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":"/b0YRn81Hxm1Lcsfzuctl9wSpJoB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48db9251416c9109a8ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Ellis","original_name":"Sean Ellis","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":"/b0YRn81Hxm1Lcsfzuctl9wSpJoB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48db9251416c9109a8e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2390102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Celine Quideau","original_name":"Celine Quideau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d590c5571083a0017667dd7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1320307","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAHA6ek2bNWTj77J71M1W3mvcdn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
