Moved into boxing training centers, these boys and girls undergo a rigorous regimen that grooms them to be China’s next Olympic heroes but also prepares them for life outside the ring. As these young boxers develop, the allure of turning professional for personal gain and glory competes with the main philosophy behind their training – to represent their country. Interconnected with their story is that of their charismatic coach, Qi Moxiang, who – now in his late thirties and determined to win back lost honor – trains for a significant fight.","popularity":0.1393,"poster_path":"/uRofdZ3igTVD6L8OEqfZUCvxvGI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20532,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNEX Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":38993,"logo_path":"/c4T0Dik4WZ9Nou4oD4ZXY5sgtPN.png","name":"EyeSteelFilm","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":150449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yuan Fang Media","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":22233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sundance","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-05-11","revenue":10481,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"China Heavyweight","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"En fight för framtiden","type":"TV Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"China Heavyweight","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yung Chang","original_name":"Yung Chang","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/ySzHfZflnyr5byvrdNPCJmwaEBd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c9109b073","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3133962,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sun Shaoguang","original_name":"Sun Shaoguang","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d32cf7e54d5d0047bc67ae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2082232","wikidata_id":"Q3736095","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x0bjGXr7mGpb7LSMP4EWZXYHKeR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bcdcvemQkAnANIxPiwrhD72WDoS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uRofdZ3igTVD6L8OEqfZUCvxvGI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gaXVINRLsRJgpXHB9g4eo2Ol97G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1382},{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":2765,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/at59uZrXYQ7Oo5J9SBVpSVOzaL9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2012-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"China Heavyweight Official Trailer #1 (2012) - Documentary Movie HD","key":"8utBPHp88PY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-05-29T19:51:07.000Z","id":"60d32ccf957e6d0046010964"}]}}}
