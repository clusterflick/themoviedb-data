The movie begins with his funeral, as he speaks from beyond the grave in a bitter tone about his fate, and takes us through his fame, as he ruins it with womanizing and drink, and his fall, as a lonely, bitter old man unable to reconcile his life's disappointments. The movie is based loosely on the life of Buster Keaton.","popularity":2.8431,"poster_path":"/tHDfVim67fP1hfQk1cXCWuHPKG7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acre Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A funny new motion picture that tells Hollywood like it was!","title":"The Comic","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Van Dyke","original_name":"Dick Van Dyke","popularity":2.0643,"profile_path":"/qC352VsuULdYtHnATOSDjFbS6NC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Billy Bright","credit_id":"52fe49129251416c910a1c8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Lee","original_name":"Michele Lee","popularity":0.6101,"profile_path":"/a8C8GqgTtQ9M6lgFdmz3tOpFJ0A.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Gibson","credit_id":"52fe49129251416c910a1c93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Rooney","original_name":"Mickey Rooney","popularity":1.0004,"profile_path":"/eYuayEC3xhXQf3Z1Cy6AVMEcgZb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cockeye","credit_id":"52fe49129251416c910a1c97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornel Wilde","original_name":"Cornel Wilde","popularity":0.3235,"profile_path":"/1IJ9DLHUCgAWuYgj2zJMC5Mca8S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frank Powers","credit_id":"52fe49129251416c910a1c9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":164777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Wayne","original_name":"Nina Wayne","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/45Ci7f44eALP8E2OwOhFtnZiLmL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sybil Atlas","credit_id":"52fe49129251416c910a1c9f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":179384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pert Kelton","original_name":"Pert Kelton","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/xTFARq5lohHXJv6mH9swroYYQha.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mama Bell","credit_id":"52fe49129251416c910a1ca3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Allen","original_name":"Steve Allen","popularity":0.4207,"profile_path":"/smfesYmaX6pfZefpYU6L69ePwiG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Steve Allen","credit_id":"5682e02fc3a3682abc00e9df","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2701248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Heller","original_name":"Barbara Heller","popularity":0.2052,"profile_path":"/pXBqkO4IMc0Q13tbjI827gTFHDz.jpg","cast_id":31,"character":"Ginger","credit_id":"5f0090bd7caa470036ddaa46","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Peck","original_name":"Ed Peck","popularity":0.2599,"profile_path":"/eqNphTRvcIuH9PeHRfowR55ReuU.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Edwin G.
