It has arisen at a key juncture in history, when humans have come to rival nature as a power determining the fate of the earth.","popularity":1.2605,"poster_path":"/pugNAh2UdzEWX3tRPpElhpSDCJE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3095,"logo_path":"/AgLxsYktHv5yKq8NCSyWBCvUFRp.png","name":"Whitewater Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":29570,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fierce Green Fire","video":false,"vote_average":5.833,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Fierce Green Fire: The Battle for a Living Planet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meryl Streep","original_name":"Meryl Streep","popularity":2.6996,"profile_path":"/g5cVxQBAQ3AXt3LhdBXtbbN47Uc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Judd","original_name":"Ashley Judd","popularity":3.3881,"profile_path":"/5771ZxVIs5rQbI1SV8TOlAFcF15.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Redford","original_name":"Robert Redford","popularity":1.7409,"profile_path":"/hNiy78lk26xTE6tjisSCowcOVw0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Allende","original_name":"Isabel Allende","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/3509p9F5b4qjYgUerxXLiLLtQqy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Van Jones","original_name":"Van Jones","popularity":0.1615,"profile_path":"/lh6KOxZiM90jk2swWpsRB0UxTW0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2023631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Brower","original_name":"David Brower","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/oPrjhbOVfnXdWHYArN3ufSUOk4D.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6667c37f9c0998ff301c3d55","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kitchell","original_name":"Mark Kitchell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kitchell","original_name":"Mark Kitchell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2c3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282525,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonathan Beckhardt","original_name":"Jonathan Beckhardt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2c9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":162953,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ken Schneider","original_name":"Ken Schneider","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1118823,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Veronica Selver","original_name":"Veronica Selver","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c9109b2d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1539489","wikidata_id":"Q114274604","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pugNAh2UdzEWX3tRPpElhpSDCJE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ssFLBZcfVAKYINuc7zfdpvKXMLm.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":963},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/FKZYiUisgKDjM1uWJnUC1BQCcw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2012-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2014-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
