During 2006, he and his three sons, open a new Le Cirque, taking four months longer and $4 million more than planned. The film follows this process, the new restaurant's opening, and the emotional impact of two New York Times reviews over the next few months. Maccioni, in his 70s, seems tired, chained to his work for his sons's sake; then, the restaurant opens and his indefatigable charm returns. It's a roller coaster ride. At the film's end, Maccioni, with a small Gucci bag on his hip, receives communion in a church in his home town of Montecatini Italy.","popularity":1.4578,"poster_path":"/2sOJLAtUIrSNc16XMsQkXG5YOrd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Cirque: A Table in Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Bennett","original_name":"Tony Bennett","popularity":0.3889,"profile_path":"/gcbLJMKNsbhkvOobTDOT7DfdDZF.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f315","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Collins","original_name":"Joan Collins","popularity":1.5519,"profile_path":"/jmXqOnp2xBDl2EMuU5Rj39uHzUQ.jpg","cast_id":1012,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f31d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Cosby","original_name":"Bill Cosby","popularity":0.9078,"profile_path":"/oN2wqTSYNrMliATEijuBYV4vi9z.jpg","cast_id":1013,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f321","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Reagan","original_name":"Nancy Reagan","popularity":0.3361,"profile_path":"/eqQwZhkI9RXpeIBQh8eOGoiUQBy.jpg","cast_id":1014,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f325","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert De Niro","original_name":"Robert De Niro","popularity":9.1089,"profile_path":"/cT8htcckIuyI1Lqwt1CvD02ynTh.jpg","cast_id":1015,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f329","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Giuliani","original_name":"Rudolph Giuliani","popularity":0.2991,"profile_path":"/jcDZkl6E5nhpNCqdi7PwqWiCiBy.jpg","cast_id":1016,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f32d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bloomberg","original_name":"Michael Bloomberg","popularity":0.204,"profile_path":"/uJq3orJqLcZvxT0mjWAPSm2v9Ne.jpg","cast_id":1025,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5687b7ffc3a368227b01812d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Joel","original_name":"Billy Joel","popularity":0.3871,"profile_path":"/wXlIKgFnXK2Af6cetw9oF0kGcRc.jpg","cast_id":1017,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f331","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":533195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Kissinger","original_name":"Henry Kissinger","popularity":0.5265,"profile_path":"/91UzhTU4tZUFNloNdn0lakKFdbH.jpg","cast_id":1018,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f335","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Egidiana Maccioni","original_name":"Egidiana Maccioni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1019,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f339","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Maccioni","original_name":"Marco Maccioni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1020,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f33d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Maccioni","original_name":"Mario Maccioni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1021,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48fe9251416c9109f341","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931018,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gregory P.
