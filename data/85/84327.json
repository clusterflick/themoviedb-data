We open on the triumphant construction of the biggest house in America, a sprawling, 90,000-square-foot mansion inspired by Versailles. Since a booming time-share business built on the real-estate bubble is financing it, the economic crisis brings progress to a halt and seals the fate of its owners. We witness the impact of this turn of fortune over the next two years in a riveting film fraught with delusion, denial, and self-effacing humor.","popularity":1.2422,"poster_path":"/9VxMIPT3nGusKhr8084m26vdeTj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1030,"logo_path":"/bus7KzJshT0VMXuKR7dwK5bqPSO.png","name":"Magnolia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":47940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evergreen Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14909,"logo_path":"/8fLjVGiX8adkseQMCIBYt3UYFiO.png","name":"Impact Partners","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10029,"logo_path":"/dvWOehJOwxDSCHiHspvKEmaaWsO.png","name":"Candescent Films","origin_country":""},{"id":107390,"logo_path":"/1QXh9Ych967FsJ0BlP2XGaTbHJG.png","name":"Plus Pictures","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":50510,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Storyville","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-07-06","revenue":714544,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen of Versailles","video":false,"vote_average":6.892,"vote_count":204,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Η Βασίλισσα των Βερσαλλιών","type":"Greek"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Siegel","original_name":"Jacqueline Siegel","popularity":0.0576,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Self (as Jackie Siegel)","credit_id":"52fe48eb9251416c9109ca85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Siegel","original_name":"David Siegel","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48eb9251416c9109ca89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Nebab","original_name":"Virginia Nebab","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Self -
