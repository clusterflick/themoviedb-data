Manfred, a faculty psychologist, jumps at the career opportunity of a lifetime, spurred on by his girlfriend, Therese, who is also a co-worker. Then a new psychologist joins the staff, jeopardising his plans. It pains Manfred, who bends over backwards to curry favour, no end to see his new colleague, Poul, win over the institute chairman with his smooth, easy-going style. It is time, Manfred figures, to tip the scales of justice.","popularity":0.3918,"poster_path":"/auaWtyGn4JBTdqmkGDB0gAx9tGj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tju Bang Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2008-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moving Up","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gantzler","original_name":"Peter Gantzler","popularity":0.2447,"profile_path":"/1oL9VT7YLfaly3BwAcKj5xquoCo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Manfred Finnemann","credit_id":"52fe45479251416c9102cf35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stine Stengade","original_name":"Stine Stengade","popularity":0.183,"profile_path":"/pDfD4IwsYGYerUXVMdFtgcepSOL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Therese","credit_id":"52fe45489251416c9102cf39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Prip","original_name":"Henrik Prip","popularity":0.3248,"profile_path":"/z9ppJpTJWZqAuWZyQFyTz96pKJl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Poul","credit_id":"52fe45489251416c9102cf3d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels Weyde","original_name":"Niels Weyde","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":"/eWP43BfRV5khGLN0vzGdvpx71kO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Knud","credit_id":"52fe45489251416c9102cf41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Gylling Mortensen","original_name":"Tina Gylling Mortensen","popularity":0.2694,"profile_path":"/lEfHPhvBRoOgzNlwVZ35sZN7Twb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anita","credit_id":"52fe45489251416c9102cf45","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1430280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Signe Vaupel","original_name":"Signe Vaupel","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/l6R5WhQJPPM3nt9YRRiHTX8W6vR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"5b682d340e0a267ee70c972c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1683235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morten Hemmingsen","original_name":"Morten Hemmingsen","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/hhcUC9cyhulHxhrKMXWqV44Q8XP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kasper","credit_id":"5b682d550e0a267eed0cf16a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla Bisgaard","original_name":"Camilla Bisgaard","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Secretary","credit_id":"5b682d62c3a368189d0be424","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Dyekjær","original_name":"Christian Dyekjær","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zenrgxcANF1pfHaEyb6m0eHPVwQ.jpg","credit_id":"5668775fc3a36836a60038ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Dyekjær","original_name":"Christian Dyekjær","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zenrgxcANF1pfHaEyb6m0eHPVwQ.jpg","credit_id":"56687766c3a36836af00365c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1546908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nynne Oldenburg","original_name":"Nynne Oldenburg","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56687774c3a36836a60038b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1133603","wikidata_id":"Q12336669","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXoIkGWm9vFzU9L1keFelUsXXaT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dhsqFoSuNd4rKhh1rrafH86xdda.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/auaWtyGn4JBTdqmkGDB0gAx9tGj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/2evGBzpnIdwJgPCqFNhTJV3XpSd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD release","release_date":"2008-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
