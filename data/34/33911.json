Berta is a single nurse raising her deceased sister's three teenage children in a Spanish port city. The two boys are neo-Nazis with a flaming hatred for African immigrants, and the girl has a boyfriend who runs an underground business smuggling illegal aliens from Africa. Into this time bomb comes a cop, Eduardo, who is investigating the vicious assault of a black man. He and Berta fall for each other and make tigerish love in scenes that are much hotter than you might expect from middle-aged actors.","popularity":0.3493,"poster_path":"/2HscsQClBeidGmew1hpt78g7SQJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2001-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savages","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Paredes","original_name":"Marisa Paredes","popularity":0.3535,"profile_path":"/71esuRUCyeSyib35mTFPkR24zH7.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45429251416c9102c457","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imanol Arias","original_name":"Imanol Arias","popularity":0.3272,"profile_path":"/lbBiRaDzDzojfs6VbMfgzsf6QnI.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45429251416c9102c45b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Morón","original_name":"Manuel Morón","popularity":0.2436,"profile_path":"/kK9liGaocGdahQc4RnnMxm5U7V5.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45429251416c9102c45f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Casamajor","original_name":"Roger Casamajor","popularity":0.2469,"profile_path":"/1UQozr5Y4C9HlFAWvsjsLPvThLF.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45429251416c9102c463","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Isasi","original_name":"María Isasi","popularity":0.1473,"profile_path":"/ajVnJ9OSiQIUbOWxhTruXNUTrqv.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45429251416c9102c467","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Molinero","original_name":"Carlos Molinero","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45429251416c9102c453","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0295581","wikidata_id":"Q6117853","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2HscsQClBeidGmew1hpt78g7SQJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
