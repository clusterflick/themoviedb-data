Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in partnership with New York Women in Film & Television in 2004.","popularity":1.6613,"poster_path":"/ellKxaweJC09DShpyvMESZZW9cO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7942,"logo_path":"/jcPtOtTkjEhvdJE6libr8ReqUch.png","name":"Cabin Creek
