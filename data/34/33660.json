On the road, he meets young Marty Preston and follows him home. The boy immediately forms a bond with the dog and names him Shiloh. His stern father won't let him keep the dog because it belongs to Judd Travers, a local hunter. After Shiloh is mistreated again, he runs away and returns to Marty. Knowing his father will once again make him bring Shiloh back to Judd, he makes a home for the dog in an old shed up the hill from the Prestons' house and hides him from his family. His secret is soon discovered when a stray attacks the dog one night and he must turn to his father for help.","popularity":2.8627,"poster_path":"/rcgucx2QaFnqlIVLTQUSfi0js4r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Dog Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Utopia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeta Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a boy who risks everything to save his best friend.","title":"Shiloh","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":71,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Shiloh O Melhor Amigo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"El Precio de Una Promesa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"Shiloh: El Precio de Una Promesa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Shailo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ビーグル犬 シャイロ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blake Heron","original_name":"Blake Heron","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":"/mJJfFA56PD3dZjlbwAo1hEryTSB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"52fe452d9251416c91029f3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":156432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
