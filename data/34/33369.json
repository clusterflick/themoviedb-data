When the kids discover this dark truth, all hell breaks loose...literally! The mother bites the son, who grows fangs and becomes consumed with blood lust. Meanwhile, all this vampire activity wreaks havoc on the daughter's romance with her handsome, dashing fiance. It all leads to a foray into the occult that ultimately proves true love can live on forever, but not before a mob of angry villagers and avenging priests take on the Devil himself in a climactic battle between good and evil. Set in nineteenth century Mexico and performed by a Filipino cast, \"Blood of the Vampires\" has something for everyone: blood-soaked action for the guys, tender romance for the ladies, and unleashed demonic rage for the frightened child within us all.","popularity":1.22,"poster_path":"/7Qc0ReYlqhiZ7mPaoKkwGzVM0ew.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinematic Titanic: Blood of the Vampires","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trace Beaulieu","original_name":"Trace Beaulieu","popularity":0.3297,"profile_path":"/2AB4g7ZSEU3Q5C5Bt6xthvOYK87.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45119251416c91026647","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Conniff","original_name":"Frank Conniff","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/dWiyYrczRjH78n6ppe9YiSU1u52.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45119251416c9102664b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30024,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Joel Hodgson","original_name":"Joel Hodgson","popularity":0.3018,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45119251416c9102664f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Jo Pehl","original_name":"Mary Jo Pehl","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/huWFK2lnHxDcocuk0uMpMrkwOcO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45119251416c91026653","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
