He learns he has a disease that will soon kill him painfully, so he hires a stranger to arrange his own death. With one eye on the calendar (he's allowed a few days' grace before his murder), he pursues a final case, the serial killing of young women. Emmett develops a profile of the assailant. Meanwhile, his fixer hires an ex-cop to kill Emmett, a lonely security guard whom the fixer taunts and belittles. In this limited time, can Emmett sort out what's important?","popularity":1.1743,"poster_path":"/z33ANbYqbxQWqQ4bsMFSl8dRIHl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In order to avoid the debilitating effects of a terminal illness, a young detective orders a hit on himself.","title":"Killing Emmett Young","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"There's No Way Out","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Contratto Con La Morte","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Emmett's Mark","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Killing Emmett Young","type":"Video Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Wolf","original_name":"Scott Wolf","popularity":0.8226,"profile_path":"/pg1K2DNuX5LWZ1KqYpX6ykdeLYa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Emmett Young","credit_id":"52fe452a9251416c910299c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Byrne","original_name":"Gabriel Byrne","popularity":1.6866,"profile_path":"/9r9oDGENg92VYYFMkV4C09IUlrb.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jack Marlow / Stephen Bracken","credit_id":"544da4b10e0a2608d0003535","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Roth","original_name":"Tim Roth","popularity":2.2064,"profile_path":"/qSizF2i9gz6c6DbAC5RoIq8sVqX.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"John Harrett / Frank Dwyer","credit_id":"544da534c3a3682429000bb5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Wood","original_name":"Greg Wood","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/rpOK5GEHI0FH0EnTXZutLUKkcpx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Dan Kilbannon","credit_id":"52fe452a9251416c910299cd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira Hawkins","original_name":"Ira Hawkins","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/dhLiPCj1GW33hl5qwGWevXxPtdg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Det.
