Psychedelic magickian. Outer head of the Illuminati. Quantum psychologist. Sit-down comic/philosopher. Discordian Pope. Whatever the label and rank, Robert Anton Wilson is undeniably one of the foundations of 21th Century Western counterculture.Maybe Logic follows a reality labyrinth which leads through the hollows of human perception to the vast star fields of Sirius where we find one man alone, joyfully accepting his status as Damned Old Crank and Cosmic Schmuck. Beaming with insight, frustration, compassion, and unshakable optimism, the ever-open eye of Robert Anton Wilson penetrates human illusions exposing the mathematical probabilities and spooky synchronicities of the 8 dimensions of his Universe.","popularity":0.2413,"poster_path":"/jrUXztonmpqJIGnhIBiOrYA8tvq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deepleaf Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maybe Logic: The Lives and Ideas of Robert Anton Wilson","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Anton Wilson","original_name":"Robert Anton Wilson","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe452e9251416c9102a19d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Rushkoff","original_name":"Douglas Rushkoff","popularity":0.2127,"profile_path":"/uDdnrbIEmPyEHyy5oTUITEgHMPM.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5306c1fe92514113c5000102","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Corral","original_name":"Valerie Corral","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5306c2189251411306000143","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Krassner","original_name":"Paul Krassner","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/Annp8olwRTkkzNrqa4mo3LJnXms.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5306c22e92514113c500010a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Robbins","original_name":"Tom Robbins","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/cy5UkhnU0q2lOXtnhGirDPq3i1w.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5306c24292514103e3000121","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.U.
