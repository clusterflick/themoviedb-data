Russian troops destroyed Mykolaiv's major infrastructure and most of the city's residents have left – including Vitalii's wife and children – but the factory has delivered bread to the besieged population every day since the full scale invasion broke out. Lost in memories of the past and an uncertain future, Vitalii finds solace in the continued rhythm of the factory.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87763,"logo_path":"/Ah77uoGeiXGkaUpghqcZWfdSejy.png","name":"The Guardian","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ukrainian Factory: two years of war for a Mykolaiv key worker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitalii Velychurov,","original_name":"Vitalii Velychurov,","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"65ea3f6d72c13e0185c592b0","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
