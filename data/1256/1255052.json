Their focus is on two of the most impressive engineering creations of the ancients: the Temple Mount, a holy icon larger than 20 football fields, and the man-made mountain of Herodium, an opulent palace built on top of millions of tons of hand carved rock.  Both structures were created by King Herod the Great - known as one of history's most reviled characters, but also known for his visionary engineering. From the iconic Wailing Wall to deep into the dangerous West Bank, Steve and his team travel across Jerusalem and beyond on the trail of King Herod's remarkable building ambitions. Using cutting-edge laser technology to analyze constructions made at the time of Christ, they discover new revelations about the skills of Herod's ancient builders, and answer long held mysteries about his magnificent structures.","popularity":0.1798,"poster_path":"/yHdNcRMI5AUIaMYHwc4Se6c5rBe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8172,"logo_path":"/z8wiYrvJAwbm2jcPSj8qVqWh4RP.png","name":"Atlantic Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Scanners: Jerusalem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Burrows","original_name":"Steve Burrows","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65e80081c15f89018616a778","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dallas Campbell","original_name":"Dallas Campbell","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/lBr4n544irZKPgm4Fg6x0Tg9kGB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65e80096344a8e017d3ee5ba","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Taylor","original_name":"Jay Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e800f49638640181c93c50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Geffen","original_name":"Anthony Geffen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e80114a6c1040187e93d75","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3692648","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":2051,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yHdNcRMI5AUIaMYHwc4Se6c5rBe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
