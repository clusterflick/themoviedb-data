Having summarily received a sentence to hell, she demands an appeal. This sets her on a path of spiritual discovery, shepherded by three strangely familiar characters. It should be noted that this film is psychological and spiritual in focus, but definitely not a mainstream Christian film. The film does contain adult themes and some strong language.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":222657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shaffer Media Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Appealing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Warren","original_name":"Kelly Warren","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Christine","credit_id":"65e7eeb0344a8e017d3ec13d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Manfred","original_name":"Michael Manfred","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Father","credit_id":"65e7eec842f19f01878d210a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse DeLozier","original_name":"Jesse DeLozier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Son","credit_id":"65e7eed3c15f890186167866","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin Greene","original_name":"Austin Greene","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65e7eeed9638640161c86ddb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4575479,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Valerie K.
