Their goal is white supremacy. They organize themselves in online forums, run dating sites only for whites, or parade through small German towns like Wunsiedel in Bavaria every year with burning torches. They make no secret of their contempt for democratic institutions and want to specifically infiltrate the police and army. The ultra-right are no longer just agitating at the regulars' table, but are also showing an increasing willingness to use violence. In France, security authorities are also monitoring right-wing extremist groups. In 2022, French media revealed that there is a right-wing network within the French army that is openly committed to Nazi ideology. The racially motivated murder of Federico Aramburú in 2022 or the case of the right-wing agitator Daniel Conversano put the authorities on alert.","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":"/cdOesbHSI8xypoxi9j07ReCFpnQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slug News","origin_country":""},{"id":222858,"logo_path":null,"name":"M6","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultra-right and Neo-Nazi Groups: The New Terrorist Threat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Ultra-droite et groupes néo-nazis : La nouvelle menace terroriste","type":"alternative spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Enquête Exclusive: Ultra-droite et groupes néo-nazis -
