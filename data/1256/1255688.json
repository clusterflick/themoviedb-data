Despite using the building as a congregating element of the different stories exposed in the film, its protagonists are the memories and stories of those who became emotionally involved with the building.  These memories, as well as the ballast with the same name as the title, serve as support for the \"building-ship\" that is slowly sinking.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nVLjxjPBGVUnaapgYaDdtelAZDz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballast - São Pedro Hotel Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katia Pinto","original_name":"Katia Pinto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e9e938389da10148d61014","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lúcio Brasileiro","original_name":"Lúcio Brasileiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e9e94a3d7454017db9f406","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umbelina Walraven","original_name":"Umbelina Walraven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e9e9623396b9018684db33","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Helena","original_name":"Lucia Helena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e9e970af95900161dc4f56","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salim Neto","original_name":"Salim Neto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e9e97c3d7454017db9f45c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Lima","original_name":"Michelle Lima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e9e9a26beaea01867a7b9c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeca Prado","original_name":"Rebeca Prado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e9e9dc3d7454017db9f4ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeca Prado","original_name":"Rebeca Prado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e9ea1372c13e0185c52ee9","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebeca Prado","original_name":"Rebeca Prado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e9ea2c389da10180d7f90f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578116,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rebeca Prado","original_name":"Rebeca Prado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e9ea4972c13e0185c52f6c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578117,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rômulo Fonseca","original_name":"Rômulo Fonseca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e9ea9d6beaea01867a7d82","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578120,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rodrigo Gondim","original_name":"Rodrigo Gondim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e9eab36a22270130949b87","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4578122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Gondim","original_name":"Bruno Gondim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e9eae65aba3201306f4075","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vxOSILXQeV4SZIKSrs6Io1CUOB5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/nVLjxjPBGVUnaapgYaDdtelAZDz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
