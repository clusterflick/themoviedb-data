In the room next door lives an old inventor, a good friend of Pat and Patachon\"s. He’s been working on a television set for some time now, and it seems that his efforts will bear fruit. Patachon has caught the inventing bug and wants to come up with smokeless and noiseless gunpowder. All the while, Pat becomes increasingly worried about his friend. Two shady gentlemen are now attempting to steal the valuable drawings for the television invention, and Pat and Patachon become suspects in the case. Fortunately, the real thieves are caught, and Patachon gets the opportunity to demonstrate his ingenious invention.
