Bennett implicates the Prophet Joseph Smith and Porter Rockwell in the crime. Though these accusations are vehemently denied by Joseph and his supporters, arrest warrants are issued for the Prophet and his protector. Joseph's warrant is dismissed; however, Porter Rockwell, not yet thirty, is arrested. After spending nine months in jail, Porter is finally brought to court for a grand-jury hearing to determine if there is sufficient evidence to indict him-a hurdle the state of Missouri must clear to proceed with a full criminal trial. This taut courtroom drama brings to life the friendship of Joseph and Porter and the original story behind the larger-than-life, legendary Porter Rockwell.","popularity":0.1429,"poster_path":"/ry55ugWCRj0YRHTxgm99SeBxm1L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mainstay Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Covenant Communications","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trial of Porter Rockwell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Breinholt","original_name":"Stephanie Breinholt","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Rockwell","credit_id":"662fd05124f2ce01232b2adf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Lyde","original_name":"John Lyde","popularity":0.2019,"profile_path":"/3OqB073x5rbXNR9QZQXTd5qNLLo.jpg","credit_id":"662fcf8224f2ce01262b2a04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joshua Michael French","original_name":"Joshua Michael French","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/uUawrtiBezZJz9p8rEYKUK9Dg4p.jpg","credit_id":"662fcf9d1f0275012714e785","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10367686","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1510,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ry55ugWCRj0YRHTxgm99SeBxm1L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1022}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
