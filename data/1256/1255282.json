When glaciation took hold some 34 million years ago, interconnected rivers of ice combined to produce the Earth's vast ice sheets. As temperatures slowly warmed glaciers developed a unique balancing act; advancing and retreating to calibrate their annual winter accumulation against summer melt. Sometimes calving colossal icebergs into the sea. A positive feedback loop that has regulated the movement of ice for millions of years.","popularity":0.3018,"poster_path":"/aZECikZ8wSAyH25c2V8o9DBdPWa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council Norway","origin_country":""},{"id":114951,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Union","origin_country":""},{"id":149723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldsmiths, University of London","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2024-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moving Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Schuppli","original_name":"Susan Schuppli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e8b6892b1b4401876a55a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Schuppli","original_name":"Susan Schuppli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e8b696c15f89018617b34b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4576363,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Faiza Ahmad Khan","original_name":"Faiza Ahmad Khan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e8b6a7a6c1040164e900b4","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aZECikZ8wSAyH25c2V8o9DBdPWa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6305,"name":"pollution"},{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":195966,"name":"glaciers"},{"id":279414,"name":"ice"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"EYE Film Museum","release_date":"2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
