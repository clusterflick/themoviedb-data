Featuring LIGHT, Dandelions, Bluebells , Campions, Buttercups and Forget-Me-Nots.  This observational video was made hand held in a long continuous take with an emphasis on the importance of light, duration, and visual transformation and how changes in light affect our perception of space. It was filmed silently with no sound track to focus predominantly on the visual and to provide a contemplative and reflexive experience for the viewer.  \"If every tiny flower wanted to be a rose, spring would lose its loveliness\" St Theresa of Lisieux","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/mD3y5e68Hwel9ar29O8XtuznYav.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1707437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Woodman","original_name":"John Woodman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e87f6942f19f01878dea51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mD3y5e68Hwel9ar29O8XtuznYav.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
