Subsequently, other murders follow one another, including that of the real murderer, who was only a hitman, of the witness and of the witness's best friend. The suspect thus thinks that it is his business partner who wants to get involved but the truth turns out to be even more tangled.","popularity":0.25,"poster_path":"/wvyqimmvYFyAzAjz95zOeydaJHk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un Uomo in Trappola","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ugo Pagliai","original_name":"Ugo Pagliai","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":"/nvKs6N0xXGFsJUFoY1j3dHZOdk5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Giorgio","credit_id":"65e8660ea1a9ba0162be5569","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorenza Guerrieri","original_name":"Lorenza Guerrieri","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/9WbCH4wvjYyRub5xpD8znsPSrej.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Giovanna","credit_id":"65e86647eb093201871c931b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Diberti","original_name":"Luigi Diberti","popularity":0.1024,"profile_path":"/lNLDMKKAyGIGCEmHln82jB5Sdd0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luca","credit_id":"65e866549638640181c9f0f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Jean","original_name":"Christiane Jean","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/zsQuxLiKLkVs44EiQb6P2IARmRS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Patrizia","credit_id":"65e8666a3fe160017b5da21c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Chatel","original_name":"Peter Chatel","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":"/xWlshh3F6fLXqHvgLo863bei8x1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Avvocato Freddi","credit_id":"65e866793fe160017b5da233","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Interlenghi","original_name":"Franco Interlenghi","popularity":0.2307,"profile_path":"/8YPUzX1WAkQxK8m6OGbiNO41Jd7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pratesi","credit_id":"65e86686caab6d0185966609","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Lopez","original_name":"Massimo Lopez","popularity":0.1658,"profile_path":"/bEZRRclQ0EfgUXIUKFjRBVcxSv7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Commissario","credit_id":"65e866949638640181c9f161","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Sofia Ricci","original_name":"Elena Sofia Ricci","popularity":0.3855,"profile_path":"/6SKKF1MWQXydnPJPQwrRE6WO0oW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Angela","credit_id":"65e866a3a6c1040187e9e89f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Chauvin","original_name":"Hélène Chauvin","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"65e866b1ea4263017b228825","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2395934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Borgogni","original_name":"Cristina Borgogni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Simona","credit_id":"65e866c4344a8e01643ea0db","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Mariotti","original_name":"Guido Mariotti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Marchese Mainardi","credit_id":"65e866d4a1a9ba0185bf25a1","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934929,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gianfranco Calligarich","original_name":"Gianfranco Calligarich","popularity":0.0796,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e86733ea4263017b2288b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittorio De Sisti","original_name":"Vittorio De Sisti","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e866f7a6c1040187e9e905","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0218693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wvyqimmvYFyAzAjz95zOeydaJHk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
