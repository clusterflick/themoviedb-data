Shannon begins having doubts about going away to college. On her last day at work, ghosts from the past help her find the courage to reach for her dreams and fly into her wonderful future.

life.","popularity":0.1255,"poster_path":"/xq0uVySgZAnKZPQ4lcR2wZLmyjX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Garage
