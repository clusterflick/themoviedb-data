But some may not know that his mother Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti was also a legend in her own right, as a women's rights activist unabashedly pushing for equality in Nigeria at a time when people weren't having those conversations. \"Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti\" the film emerges as a new vivid exploration of Ransome-Kuti's journey. From growing up and learning about the importance of education, to her groundbreaking step in becoming the first girl to attend Abeokuta Grammar School at just 13, going to London and then becoming emboldened to return to Nigeria to step into her role as an educator and organizer.","popularity":0.5371,"poster_path":"/2oxvgNFBLEKw2yBK0yMPHm7hKB3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124270,"logo_path":"/w30moDFz3SD3ZLTk4JEqNjgpDod.png","name":"BAP
