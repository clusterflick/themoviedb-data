Through the writings from within - the voices of the letters, diaries and testimonies of the internees - the labyrinthine and crumbling rooms come back to life and evoke the painful past of the psychiatric hospital. They tell of the electroshocks and tortures on adults and children carried out by Doctor Giorgio Coda, the \"electrician\" from Collegno. They tell of the official trial against him for torture and of the proletarian trial that Coda suffered at the hands of a Prima Linea group, led by one of his \"patients\". Only at dawn, with the story of the closure of the mental hospitals, will we see the light again.","popularity":0.1048,"poster_path":"/4EVyQ6Z5pvwzjF1HCf2UzxGUrGX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88675,"logo_path":null,"name":"EIE Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Scritti dall'interno","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Ferrone","original_name":"Federico Ferrone","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iWjPNertlspitktCNsIm9A0vf6T.jpg","credit_id":"66bf273ec6a85414fb92fdbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718527,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paolo Spaccamonti","original_name":"Paolo Spaccamonti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf27d8217d4f9e7f50ec87","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Manzolini","original_name":"Michele Manzolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p6kWxdqyVhPkiVkdNXw6Fi2sBeL.jpg","credit_id":"66bf27799d7ac070ae9ada7d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2128986,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Fantastica Valmori","original_name":"Maria Fantastica Valmori","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf27ba43e3bd93aa9adac6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Manzolini","original_name":"Michele Manzolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p6kWxdqyVhPkiVkdNXw6Fi2sBeL.jpg","credit_id":"66bf272c1604b60f26405be5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Ferrone","original_name":"Federico Ferrone","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iWjPNertlspitktCNsIm9A0vf6T.jpg","credit_id":"66bf278a7ba075160350edcd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845848,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zelia Zbogar","original_name":"Zelia Zbogar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf28031c15ca9349405c6f","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791672,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simone Rivoire","original_name":"Simone Rivoire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf27acbfd7eebb3b49dd3a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2201795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mirko Guerra","original_name":"Mirko Guerra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf27e88c3d8e993897c12e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1749072,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alessandro Carroli","original_name":"Alessandro Carroli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf28122b3f8d6b8792fe42","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184993,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emidio Clementi","original_name":"Emidio Clementi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf27c92b8a2c0f879a0517","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Manzolini","original_name":"Michele Manzolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p6kWxdqyVhPkiVkdNXw6Fi2sBeL.jpg","credit_id":"66c2426d9aa8442fb444e4a5","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Ferrone","original_name":"Federico Ferrone","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iWjPNertlspitktCNsIm9A0vf6T.jpg","credit_id":"66c24264ae8df56d1889a694","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1031,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4EVyQ6Z5pvwzjF1HCf2UzxGUrGX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":687}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190007,"name":"mental hospital"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
