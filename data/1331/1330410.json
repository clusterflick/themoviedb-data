Sam (played by Pezzullo), a painfully narcissistic and delusional theater producer, attempts to make a musical version of his favorite movie, SCREAM, at a local theater in Sag Harbor, New York, encountering a series of awkward and outrageous scenarios along the way. Supported by a cast of quirky characters and real life locals, the film is both a love letter to and a satirical commentary on the Hamptons that breaks the mold of traditional storytelling, described by the filmmakers simply as a mockumentary about a documentary about making a musical about a movie.","popularity":0.0866,"poster_path":"/s0VKWRRLCczGDMGLcqoPZXzOAJG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Made Out East","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Premiere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Pezzullo","original_name":"Sam Pezzullo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"670bfa05f58a9206aa410683","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marissa Ruben","original_name":"Marissa Ruben","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66be56ee746306a90c979971","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2606154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Brown","original_name":"Christina Brown","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/jcYLxf1A5gymNqa69BCRKYL28wR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66be56f221bd03dfd49b8672","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2441694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Dougherty","original_name":"Tim Dougherty","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/psVjKGwMeMeor5MwnxttPVAHnqO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66be56fa0000dc40c19799e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Ceppos","original_name":"Alan Ceppos","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/j4vKQyFlZvc7yiFHV46Nlmr0Ptz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66be56ff7b3a952eb803b836","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendy Federman","original_name":"Wendy Federman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66be57051c15ca93494039f2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2134280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenni Ruiza","original_name":"Jenni Ruiza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/zx5YELXk9fd7xpt1Ha11a4AsFB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66be570b746306a90c97997c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Pezzullo","original_name":"Sam Pezzullo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66be56dad464b2a070979ae3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Bouckoms","original_name":"Christopher Bouckoms","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66be56e3c2fddd06c28292ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26771891","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1226,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s0VKWRRLCczGDMGLcqoPZXzOAJG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":820}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hamptons International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
