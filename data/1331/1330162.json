It also aroused great interest of the film's producer, Walter Scheuer. However, the film was based on Stern's visit, and other content could not be covered too much. After winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1981, the film was screened in Europe and the United States. Foreigners were eager to understand China, which began to reform and open. When Tan visited the United States, Britain, France and other countries in the 1980s, people often greeted him and recognized him as Professor Tan who spoke in the film. Therefore, as the producer, Scheuer felt that he should make another documentary to introduce Tan's legendary and extraordinary experience.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":236479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hopewell Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gentleman From Shanghai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"来自上海的绅士","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4887207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tan Shuzhen","original_name":"Tan Shuzhen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tan Shuzhen","credit_id":"66bdde099d39cb8b1ac37f54","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2293197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heather Greer","original_name":"Heather Greer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bddce1ec41c32760e14203","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"谭抒真 来自上海的绅士 The Gentleman from Shanghai 1999","key":"JrTNgPYSJnk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-16T13:14:20.000Z","id":"66bddf96005ae827cc2a4312"}]}}}
