The film follows Hamid and Yasser over six years as they contend with the life threatening conditions they and their families have to face to survive.  A rare insight into the plight of the Kurdish people, this is an elegant portrait of a marginalised people, where the palpable sense of risk and danger is contrasted with the gentle rhythms of family life under harsh conditions.","popularity":0.2167,"poster_path":"/dhSmR8T0U24Z922LHzHF8IoWhwC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Mountains Give","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamid Alimohamadi","original_name":"Hamid Alimohamadi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66be8eb10b3fa0b04855914f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasser Dadrast","original_name":"Yasser Dadrast","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66be8ecf596c0bfb039b88ae","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arash Rakhsha","original_name":"Arash Rakhsha","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66be8c9c610373cd5c05ca04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arash Rakhsha","original_name":"Arash Rakhsha","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66be8eee5bf68c090a9b8464","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arash Rakhsha","original_name":"Arash Rakhsha","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66be8f0147ad9d534a50ccd2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32881217","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dhSmR8T0U24Z922LHzHF8IoWhwC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193749,"name":"folk"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":296186,"name":"kurdish culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ku","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
