The doll, unable to leave the island, recalls a distant memory of the violent separation from her owner and herself. A butoh dancer embodies a castaway doll and performs in a shifting landscape of disappearing bodies of water from intertidal phenomenons. Butoh, also known as the ‘dance of utter darkness’, is a post-war Japanese avant- garde art form. Like the elemental changes of states from water to vapour, she senses something present but unable to be seen. A more invisible performer takes precedence, the PD150, an attribute to forgotten and lost objects. Memory becomes the act of ‘vanishing’ and follows the sensation of ‘missing’ through a span of space and time with objects, locations and people.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/a6Zj9elyYfxmeP2gWyZiMUPfnpT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body missing body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2889631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Song","original_name":"Grace Song","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/nCbkpQ2gXfB9HB3J5w9UhTKS7hT.jpg","credit_id":"66be4c677ba075160350c98d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2565239,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shaun Neo","original_name":"Shaun Neo","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66be4c79149af50a6603b7ba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Lee Sze wei","original_name":"Alexander Lee Sze wei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66be4ca6c21f0aa8469c9fcb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a6Zj9elyYfxmeP2gWyZiMUPfnpT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
