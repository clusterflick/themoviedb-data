During interrogation, they recounted their struggle to secure grant funding. Using an AI application developed by their friends at Anarko, Santosa and his crew, who failed to obtain a grant from the ministry, resorted to manipulating an online lottery to get the production money and submit their film to a festival. After completing the shoot, they were arrested by the police and sentenced. Two months later, thanks to the efforts of their editor, Asep, who wasn't arrested, their film won a festival award.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/zWGkG3wsyrPp5dBRzVBLE4ii3ve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pemburu Hibah","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"id","file_path":"/zWGkG3wsyrPp5dBRzVBLE4ii3ve.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1497},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"id","file_path":"/cGaCyqn1sfYKVjDuHkAKl73pgGa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
