The band was formed by Dave and Donette Smith, who are brother and sister. This short documentary is about their passion for music, their first group, Street Legal, and their regional rise to success with their next band, Ivory Star. At one point, Ivory Star sold over 20,000 copies of their self-distributed compact disc, Vicious Circle, which climbed to #21 on Album Network Magazine's Coalition of Independent Music Stores Sales charts. The band also opened for many major name acts. In addition, Ivory Star had 13 major record labels interested in signing them at that time as well. However, not all dreams come true in the music business.","popularity":0.095,"poster_path":"/w5aZOZSTc2ZepbCgMCgyfHutzrM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They were a brother and sister with a dream","title":"Time To Shine","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4886620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Smith","original_name":"Dave Smith","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66bd4126c4525601f688fc88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4886622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donette Smith","original_name":"Donette Smith","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66bd41377a5b02800fe11f58","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Fields","original_name":"Jim Fields","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bd4184742534434280042c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Fields","original_name":"Jim Fields","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bd416cc2fddd06c282654a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4886632,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"christine young","original_name":"christine young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bd41d2efab099fced05e57","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Fields","original_name":"Jim Fields","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bd4198d60a17dc65e99b2b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4886629,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph William Simmons","original_name":"Joseph William Simmons","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bd41b4efab099fced05e4b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32509336","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ljiQTETUkil2K7YkxTQZJ4Aormv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1653,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w5aZOZSTc2ZepbCgMCgyfHutzrM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1102}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":336177,"name":"ivory star"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Time To Shine Trailer","key":"XbcMQ5N_Ag4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-18T14:39:10.000Z","id":"66bd425819aa4bdf0acf59d4"}]}}}
