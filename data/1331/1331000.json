Barroso employs various techniques to tell the story, contrasting images of the official offices of the authorities responsible for investigating the murder with interviews with family members, testimonies from residents of Alagoa Grande, and the public outcry surrounding the event. It's a gaze that does not waver when confronting the harsh Brazilian reality of violence and impunity, but also of the resilience and courage of the people in the face of injustice.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margarida always alive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
