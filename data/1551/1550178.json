From the film we learn that when asked about the causes of problems with Warsaw public transport, the authorities typically give the same answer: \"objective difficulties\" are to blame. The author of the documentary, the author of many films devoted to the faults and thoughtlessness of Warsaw officials, managed to identify 8 basic difficulties that make the use of public transport in the capital city in the early 1970s a nightmare. The degree of their \"objectivity\" can be decided by the viewer himself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Very Objective Difficulties","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerzy Dmowski","original_name":"Jerzy Dmowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d09047b5d34a05e1fe99a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
