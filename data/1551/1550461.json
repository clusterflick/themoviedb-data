Los Angeles premiere!\r The 2018 film document of Douglas Dunn’s Corner Dance (1972) for solo dancer, performed by the choreographer in a freestanding corner installed at his studio loft in SoHo was shot on 400 ft. of expired 16 mm color negative film stock with a 100 ft.–capacity spring-driven hand-cranked Bolex H-16 Reflex camera. A black-and-white work print was struck from the color negative. The length of each shot was determined by the camera’s fully wound spring-driven mechanism, allowing for a maximum length of approximately 18 ft. of film to advance, i.e., 28 seconds at 24 fps (frames per second).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corner Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Gibson","original_name":"Sandra Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d155deeef2f2daa0cd7b96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Recoder","original_name":"Luis Recoder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d155ed2a67c0821f97df29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
