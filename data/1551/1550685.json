Assuming our parents only have 30 more good years left and we make an effort to visit them twice a year, we realize that the number of cherished visits with our loved ones is equivalent to the amount of seconds in a minute. What if you could count them on your wrist? A countdown that tracks your limited and precious social interactions, we want to tell the story of a girl living her last interactions in life. In this dystopian world, everyone wears a smartwatch that displays the number of interactions you have left in life. Malu is down to her last 4, and she must decide between a love interest at work and spending precious time with her sick mother.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caterina Rossiti","original_name":"Caterina Rossiti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Malu","credit_id":"68d1ac01e99679837c7a4dba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Rossiti","original_name":"Adriana Rossiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Malu's Mom","credit_id":"68d1ac0827c236f3c1cd7db1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dhruv Gogia","original_name":"Dhruv Gogia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Shrub","credit_id":"68d1ac33db4c421484d41f27","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Marquet","original_name":"Adrien Marquet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1ac4709fbe406a1d41f28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705268,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Auden Kucharic","original_name":"Auden Kucharic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1ac7033e4eab140ac88ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041052,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stéphane Normandeau","original_name":"Stéphane Normandeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1ac8d1ec443b100cd7d6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4690791,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kriish Bagga","original_name":"Kriish Bagga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1aca1ddf045e02b97ded3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705268,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Auden Kucharic","original_name":"Auden Kucharic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1acb8b9737cbd25cc3d1d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705271,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte McDowell","original_name":"Charlotte McDowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1acce2a67c0821f97e0f9","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Marquet","original_name":"Adrien Marquet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1acf92a67c0821f97e0ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705281,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Skye Solmes","original_name":"Skye Solmes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1ad9c2a5e7c0a45cec98d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
