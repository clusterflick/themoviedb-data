The central dumping site in Ochota has already become an urban legend. The narrator provides us with statistical data, he also, in a literary way, develops the legend of treasures and treasure hunters. The rubble from Warsaw, ruined by the war, was taken to Szczesliwice, including any lost valuables. The protagonists, junk collectors, talk about the things they find there. The landscape of the dump is shrouded in fog, it looks like a post-apocalyptic desert in the city. There are people wandering around it who seem hypnotized by the vision of fortune. Today, after land reclamation, Szczesliwicki Park and its facilities are located there.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Szczesliwice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4540282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Włodzimierz Pomianowski","original_name":"Włodzimierz Pomianowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d05d6c5bdbe7d348fe9668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
