Matsura is the story of Frank (Sakae) Matsura, the orphaned son of a samurai, who emigrated to Washington State in 1901, eventually settling in remote Okanogan County. There he embedded himself in a community of Native people and newly arrived settlers and immigrants, including miners, ranchers, shopkeepers and cowboys. In short order, he became the region’s leading photo-chronicler and, to many, its most beloved citizen. Through his lens, Frank Matsura offered up remarkable retellings of life in the American West and gave people new ways of thinking about themselves. A century later, the people of the county and the Colville Confederated Tribes still have pride and a sense of connection to the work he created.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rDlkDEFagzOUloAs6vRNejmT6xa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Our Mr. Matsura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth Harrington","original_name":"Beth Harrington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1c0a0c86d723729cecd05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705410,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hatsumi Asaka","original_name":"Hatsumi Asaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1c0dec86d723729cecd18","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nora Colie","original_name":"Nora Colie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1c0f2ca7c17934aac8ddf","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francene J.
