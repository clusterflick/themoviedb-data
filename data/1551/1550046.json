The public loves him for his image of a macho with an impenetrable face. One day, Dmitriy receives an offer from a stern but very rich businessman from Siberia, Sergey, to star in a crime drama about the 90s in the lead role of a cold-blooded killer. Sergey offers Dmitriy's agent a fee 10 times higher than usual. They agree. During the filming, Dmitriy is accidentally wounded by a shot. After a simple operation, he is ready to return to the frame, but faces an unexpected side effect: now he constantly smiles, and any emotions are expressed with laughter. Dmitriy has no chance to stop filming and \"upset\" Sergey, who clearly knows firsthand what he is making a movie about.","popularity":0.1643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205604,"logo_path":null,"name":"Infiniti Content","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2026-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Человек, который смеётся","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Chelovek, kotoryy smeyotsya","type":"Transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Chelovek, kotoryy smeetsya","type":"Transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Человек, который смеется","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Kott","original_name":"Владимир Котт","popularity":0.2459,"profile_path":"/tCrWLYfwCqTWCowxdERF2QsjrvU.jpg","credit_id":"68d059e0c86d723729cec52f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046019,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgy Malkov","original_name":"Георгий Малков","popularity":1.1391,"profile_path":"/n7qYfFRXUFXYYyIatNu0YDsBizk.jpg","credit_id":"68d059ec92880c6571ac8146","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2217102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergey Stegniy","original_name":"Сергей Стегний","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/jay0iKMXxmaDODfClzC8oWaWqTd.jpg","credit_id":"68d059f5883e551320cec535","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4200116,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Filatova","original_name":"Анна Филатова","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d059ff4a73372dcdcec4cf","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5703071,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anastasia Somova","original_name":"Анастасия Сомова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d05a20363ebc1fc197d95f","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4692165,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aleksandr Berezhnoy","original_name":"Александр Бережной","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d05a3d65f7a745d2cc3546","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5557197,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maksim Koliganov","original_name":"Максим Колиганов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d05a472fa1f650eefe941d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
