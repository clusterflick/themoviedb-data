After her husband dies in an accident, she is left homeless and must raise her children alone. With the help of a kind stranger, she works tirelessly to give her sons a good life, only to be betrayed and abandoned by them, leaving her back on the streets.  Refusing to give up, Bharati starts over and builds a small food business into a five-star hotel empire. Years later, her now-destitute sons return to claim her fortune. When she refuses to acknowledge them, they take her to court and hire a sharpshooter to kill her. In a dramatic courtroom climax, Bharati's powerful testimony moves the killer, who turns his gun on her sons instead.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/LpetTGAbDEKKE2VzTDQI287LvN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bharat Ni Dikri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lUhzsrkAixmrS8BPTs8Ds2I2nmb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LpetTGAbDEKKE2VzTDQI287LvN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U/A 13+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"gu","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bharat Ni Dikri | Prinal Oberoi | Official Trailer | New Gujarati Movie Trailer 2025","key":"0tafeqyTKBY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-09T01:45:06.000Z","id":"68d082be1890269e05ac82e1"}]}}}
