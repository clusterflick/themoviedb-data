Storm has been abused and, having not responded to previous training, is scheduled to be put down. Stevie and Carol notice that Drew seems more than preoccupied with Pine Hollow operations, but are even more concerned that Lisa is heading for an emotional fall if efforts to re-train Storm are unsuccessful. When Stevie & Carol are cleaning up Drew's office they discover the source of his concern: bank loans are due and Pine Hollow is in deep financial straits. With the banker demanding payment, Red decides to sell the surrounding land and riding trails. The Saddle Club girls must help save Pine Hollow and the magnificent horse, Storm.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saddle Club: Storm at Pine Hollow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
