Thanks to her imagination, she sees fragments of a play focused on the history of Silesia, precisely German repressions experienced by the inhabitants of the region during World War II. When she joins a theater group in her free time, it turns out that she is the winner of a drama competition. Barbara Tkacz took first place in the School Youth National Competition. The participants had played in the \"Jedenastu\" play. We watch fragments of this spectacle at the beginning of the film. It is staged by the \"Reduta Śląska\" People's Theater from Chorzów. The history of this amateur organization dates back to 1933. It features non-professional actors, however, the theater employs professional directors, set designers, and composers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imagination Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4239343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoni Halor","original_name":"Antoni Halor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d08a5ee99679837c7a49f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
