With unprecedented access to the unpublished diaries in which Golding recorded his dreams, the film penetrates deep into his private obsessions and insecurities.  His daughter Judy and son David both speak frankly about their father's demons, and the film follows Golding from the impoverished schoolmaster whose first novel, Lord of the Flies, was published when he was 43 years old, to his winning the Nobel Prize for literature in 1983.  Other contributors include Golding's biographer John Carey, philosopher John Gray, writer Nigel Williams, the dean of Salisbury Cathedral, the Very Rev June Osborne and best-selling author Stephen King.  Benedict Cumberbatch, who starred in the 2004 BBC adaptation of Golding's sea trilogy To the Ends of the Earth, reads extracts from his books.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dreams of William Golding","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch","original_name":"Benedict Cumberbatch","popularity":3.1549,"profile_path":"/wz3MRiMmoz6b5X3oSzMRC9nLxY1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Reader","credit_id":"68d1d7f11342356566ac8a6d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Low","original_name":"Adam Low","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1d810b6836bc42997e08f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Rosenbaum","original_name":"Martin Rosenbaum","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d22f03aaaef8e9deced206","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
