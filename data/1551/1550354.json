Upon discovering it, her neighbour Hotaru joins her in holding a quiet, heartfelt funeral. This small event becomes the catalyst for the family to come together once more. For their own reasons, Yoshiko's three daughters return to the family home one by one, resuming life under the same roof. During their time together, the initial distance and unspoken tensions slowly give way to understanding. Thirty years of misunderstandings begin to dissolve through shared daily moments: quiet conversations in the kitchen, silent gestures at the dining table, and afternoons spent tending the garden. Each ordinary act brings a renewed sense of warmth and connection.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/32HQb15c2dDuuMcNlLF5Vc0wj6P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"茜色日落","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Sei","original_name":"Naomi Sei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68d129da40fc881b937a496d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aruhi Tachibana","original_name":"Aruhi Tachibana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68d129e8f04d6e5013fe99c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Ozawa","original_name":"Yuri Ozawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68d129f8c9beb2ffcbd41c36","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4057814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamaki Mahiro","original_name":"まひろ玲希","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/b4S6EGJjDSrB1DddPozUYkHPBPu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68d12a078091feb0e8cc38b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yamada Youji","original_name":"Yamada Youji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68d12a164b6b03ae6bfe99c3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miao Zhuangzhuang","original_name":"Miao Zhuangzhuang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d128f98ed9bcc2427a49b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miao Zhuangzhuang","original_name":"Miao Zhuangzhuang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d129032a67c0821f97ddd1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPpNGbcdoSbq9KGg7bimWSXWfaM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1707}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/32HQb15c2dDuuMcNlLF5Vc0wj6P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pingyao International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
