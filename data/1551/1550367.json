Bound by anemoia, a haunting nostalgia for a world they’ve never lived in, they escape into vintage clothes, old films, and midnight wanderings that blur the lines between past and present. But even as the glow of nostalgia draws them close, the weight of reality begins to pull them apart. Dreams, disappointments, and the interference of Sarah, Casey’s manipulative friend with eyes on Michael, fracture their fragile bond.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":275040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diamond Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Anemoia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Remi Lane","original_name":"Remi Lane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Casey","credit_id":"68d12e0bd8fd93ce17cec61a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Callum Miller","original_name":"Callum Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"68d12e1502048cfe22ac87b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isla Krieser","original_name":"Isla Krieser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"68d12e38eac6849073cd7c40","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4930721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benn Wintle","original_name":"Benn Wintle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hTzLOIxpbR3hHbestuZcEg68d7Y.jpg","credit_id":"68d12e59bdfacb84a7cd7f7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5092607,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicci Venter","original_name":"Nicci Venter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d12e6fddc148b09f7a4979","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4159899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Tatsiy","original_name":"Alexander Tatsiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d12e867e792b4cb07a488a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clayton Schelfhout","original_name":"Clayton Schelfhout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d12ea9b5d34a05e1fe9bef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5704157,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sophia Moldrich","original_name":"Sophia Moldrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d12ef4c535fe8294cec722","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emma McClughan","original_name":"Emma McClughan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d12f48b29b8a6d72cec7ee","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
