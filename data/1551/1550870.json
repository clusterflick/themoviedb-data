Though years apart create initial awkwardness, drugs, heartfelt conversations in nature, and late-night music sessions help them reminisce about the past and ponder their futures. However, buried tensions surface when it becomes clear that Vish is seeking to rekindle a closeness Manu may no longer want. Fear of vulnerability, emotional confrontations, and a near-drowning push their lifelong bond to its limits.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short film about friendship, change, and everything unspoken.","title":"My Brother, My Friend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
