Without her usual inspiration, she contemplates stepping away from holiday-themed books altogether. In an attempt to rekindle her creativity, she returns to her hometown of Pinewood, where she reconnects with her grandmother and old friends. She also meets Callie, a charming bookstore owner and single mother, who encourages Noel to help judge a Christmas story contest. As Noel immerses herself in the town’s festive spirit and grows closer to Callie and her daughter, she rediscovers her love for Christmas—and perhaps finds a new love story of her own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tPsh88I7W1IpiHpQBQQQh69QIjK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christmas on Main","origin_country":""},{"id":119154,"logo_path":"/97OWtUjBFLxtztMrplqrOhYtMzD.png","name":"Tello Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Christmas Writer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelby Allison Brown","original_name":"Shelby Allison Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Noel","credit_id":"68d0bcf97c3544784aac8542","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Callie Bussell","original_name":"Callie Bussell","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/3Yh4lO5cuewwVDCpcoUmoAYYpKz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Callie","credit_id":"68d0bd05c99158857dd421b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Tuss","original_name":"June Tuss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pepper","credit_id":"68d0bd10eef2f2daa0cd7928","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2103487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen M.
