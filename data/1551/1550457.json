Intermittent machine-precision line scratches on black opaque film provide the basis for this dual projection performance. The “performance” consists in an open set of carefully choreographed projector movements, including the alignment-misalignment-realignment in the distribution of the projected light or light incisions across the screen. Micro adjustments in the optical bending and diffraction of light introduce an uncanny sense of mobility that seems to transcend the fixed parameters of the loop form.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alignments for Linea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Gibson","original_name":"Sandra Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d154e9dfa54f5659d41d50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Recoder","original_name":"Luis Recoder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d154f8d8fd93ce17cec6f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
