The jujubes you didn’t catch is an exploration of the intersections of queer identity, Koreanness, and family. Flickering, overlapping images create a world that fluctuates between utopian and deeply personal, hinting at queer East Asian club nights, family photographs, and abstract glows of shape and colour. The video is cyclical and non-linear, weaving together memory, fantasy, and familial expectations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the jujubes you didn’t catch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Warner","original_name":"Ellen Warner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d07e594813db10cffe963b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
