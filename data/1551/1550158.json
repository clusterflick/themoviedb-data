An extraordinary undertaking closer to a heavy Himalayan expedition than to rock climbing. Climbing mainly on weekends in the fall and spring with companions whose level of skill was of little importance to him, Warren Harding spent a total of 47 days (spread over 17 months) on the face. 675 pitons (including 125 expansion pitons) and several thousand hammer blows were necessary to build his legend, despite the displeasure of the \"Christians of the valley,\" as he somewhat sardonically nicknamed Royal Robbins and his cronies, who swear by style.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/3G9A55MVqT4OFs8BJXbtiakNc9p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274989,"logo_path":"/3oulW8cv5GTcZ39ij8zgkPc4HbD.png","name":"Downward Bound Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warren Harding - Recollections of the First Ascent of El Capitan in Yosemity Valley","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1721022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Harding","original_name":"Warren Harding","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/5z5hkDs6C14v9JLh5ZNhrzsrNdR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d093f163370bc3d1ac81bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Bromet","original_name":"Jane Bromet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d094257c3544784aac84ae","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Derryberry","original_name":"Roger Derryberry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d0911b8ec1c32f4497dc16","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Derryberry","original_name":"Roger Derryberry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d091232a73b3a4eb7a4844","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703504,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trey Solberg","original_name":"Trey Solberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d091cb4d9f637b84d41ab1","department":"Camera","job":"Video Report"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703504,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trey Solberg","original_name":"Trey Solberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d0922847a71578de7a48e2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703513,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gene Rose","original_name":"Gene Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d092c35315e3b9e2749a40","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5703514,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kingsley Roberts","original_name":"Kingsley Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d092f27c3544784aac84a4","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5703545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Caldwell","original_name":"Dean Caldwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3Mc83FssFdoXkxTaVWz2m1sKrDk.jpg","credit_id":"68d09fdeb29b8a6d72cec5e2","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/si5kNZstNT6Uxe0V89L9MKZtcWc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3G9A55MVqT4OFs8BJXbtiakNc9p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":272233,"name":"escalade"},{"id":307173,"name":"warren harding"},{"id":320832,"name":"arrampicata"},{"id":349930,"name":"yosemite el capitan climb"},{"id":349939,"name":"mountaineering documentary film"},{"id":353046,"name":"yosemite national park"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
