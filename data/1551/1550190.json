The least damaged area during the Second World War, its tenements and wooden houses from the turn of the century remained intact. Praga has its representative part in the Art Nouveau Śródmieście district. Its small-town soul could be seen at the back of the streets, the suburban part may be noticed on the outskirts of the city. Apparently, one could be born and die without leaving the surrounding buildings, Praga satisfied all the needs of the inhabitants. The voiceover mocks the artistic aspirations of \"better people\" preserved in the facades of the tenements. It appreciates the architecture of the wooden houses, the workshops of old crafters. Through the architecture, the story of the district is told.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Praga Farewells: Album","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tadeusz Makarczyński","original_name":"Tadeusz Makarczyński","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d095b6c372f8082697dcf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
