Her life in Barcelona is stable but suffocating: a dull marriage, a grown son about to make her a grandmother, and yet another Christmas far from her hometown. On Christmas Eve, something snaps. After feeling provoked, she assaults a man in public — an impulsive, violent act that seems completely out of character. Suddenly she’s thrust into a hostile system that puts her sanity and womanhood on trial. The world says she’s lost control, but something deeper has been set in motion.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":156860,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegra Films","origin_country":""},{"id":228441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nocturna Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Face of Grace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4970204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Martí Domingo","original_name":"Anna Martí Domingo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d277eac535fe8294ceccec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Santos Martí","original_name":"Laura Santos Martí","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d277f7c835f4eb2ccc3d69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579213,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mayca Sanz","original_name":"Mayca Sanz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d278068ec1c32f4497e490","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2353057,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Rubirola","original_name":"Laura Rubirola","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d27812552d66bc3e7a5060","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4970204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Martí Domingo","original_name":"Anna Martí Domingo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d278a44b6b03ae6bfea0b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Santos Martí","original_name":"Laura Santos Martí","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d278abead97b3744cc402b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":107,"name":"barcelona, spain"},{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
