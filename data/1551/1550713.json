In 2011, the Statimc (aka Lillooet tribes) celebrated the 100 year anniversary of the Declaration of the Lillooet tribe, which firmly asserts their rights and title to their land. This film weaves personal interviews, ceremony and song into an experience the audience won't forget. The magic of these wild landscapes and rugged mountain ranges is brought to life through time-lapses and stunning cinematography. Personal testimonies heal deep wounds set in by residential schools, colonization and assimilation. Victory is triumphant in the hearts of this proud nation. Told with great symbolism and imagery, this story relates to all first nations in Canada.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"St'at'imckalh ~ Spirit of the People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2262214","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
