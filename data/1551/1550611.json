Mesmerised by the sight, Zoe sets the device in Motion until she notices that one of the figures breaks free from its position and begins to overtake its predecessor. Triggered by the zoetrope, the impossible begins to spill into Zoeâ€™s reality. As she overtakes her future self, her life begins to spiral out of control, piece by piece.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Zoetropolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Fautz","original_name":"Janina Fautz","popularity":0.2282,"profile_path":"/7W6pbHcbGTrjV5n1BgNlSBpHqLI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68d190304ff8731467cd803a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Stegmann","original_name":"Anna Stegmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d190fc8911150f37fe9e0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5705059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Sumit Becher","original_name":"Jules Sumit Becher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d191135f5f09eac0d41de5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950508,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Pia Klein","original_name":"Pia Klein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1913f4106f3b8fcceca8d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
