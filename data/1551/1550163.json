Their conversations regularly cover the subject of the various issues that tailors and seamstresses have to deal with in their everyday lives. But when customers make complaints and comments about tight jackets and crooked jackets, they can only count on aggression or saying it can’t be helped. All for all is the title of a poem by Julian Tuwim, starting with a stanza: \"A bricklayer builds houses, / The tailor sews clothes, / but where would he sew if he didn't have a flat\". Kindergarten children learn from the poem that every job serves some purpose and we need each other. Paweł Kędzierski in his documentary ironically shows that the devil is in the details.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wszyscy dla wszystkich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Kędzierski","original_name":"Paweł Kędzierski","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/5qTzXi4yKgsveAGmaXLhG8ST4v6.jpg","credit_id":"68d089ff36ea691370cd796c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leszek Tarnowski","original_name":"Leszek Tarnowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d08a09519f725d68cc378b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
