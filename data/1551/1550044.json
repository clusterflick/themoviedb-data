But tragedy shatters every pretense of normalcy: to have her father back for herself, Viola mercilessly kills those she considers \"the two intruders.\" This is a shocking tale of how a girl can drown day after day in absolute, silent, and unexpressed despair, and how a father struggles to remain a father even in the face of the most extreme evil.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qualunque cosa accada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35270287","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
