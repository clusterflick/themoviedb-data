The verticality of the filmstrip’s passage through the projector is the subject matter of the work, emphasized not only be the absence of intermittent motion which normally arrests the filmstrip into so many frames-per-second, but also by the placement of a Plexiglas cylinder directly in front of the lens, thus elongating and stretching the light source.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lightline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Gibson","original_name":"Sandra Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d1546e3c2aefb468749d54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Recoder","original_name":"Luis Recoder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d154822b7b99047bac8657","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
