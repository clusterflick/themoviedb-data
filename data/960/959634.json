The Amoco-Cadiz supertanker tanker sank off Portsall, a small port in northern Finistère. This film sets out to demonstrate the misleading information campaign that followed the accident as well as its disastrous ecological consequences. René Vautier denounces the ridiculous measures then taken by the governments, the financial interests, the traffic of oil tankers and those of the tugs and the role of the media complicit in this policy. Faced with this, the anger of the Breton people and local elected officials who were never consulted.","popularity":0.0845,"poster_path":"/ekbNMcLFgblLaFtv34BR0wY4GK2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marée noire et colère rouge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"624e0a4e387651009a060b54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0323203","wikidata_id":"Q109044380","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1437,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ekbNMcLFgblLaFtv34BR0wY4GK2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
