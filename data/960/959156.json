Final preparations are underway for the premiere of \"Women's House\" for its benefit performance. The artist is besieged by journalists, directors and documentary filmmakers. The anniversary makes her reflect on the meaning of her own life and work. The actress, although surrounded by admirers and friends, feels lonely and misunderstood. Her reflections are contrasted with the manner of the manicurist Angelika (Emilia Krakowska), a woman not burdened with popularity and the stresses and sacrifices associated with her. Klara's deliberations are interrupted by a call for the jubilee premiere.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klara i Angelika","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868146,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maria Dąbrowska","original_name":"Maria Dąbrowska","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6698326bed6c94a836bfb1c4","department":"Writing","job":"Short Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irena Kamieńska","original_name":"Irena Kamieńska","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669832858844d151c32986c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138549,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Władysław Terlecki","original_name":"Władysław Terlecki","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6698327d0dea309d110f507f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0400582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1977-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
