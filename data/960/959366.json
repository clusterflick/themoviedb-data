She was given the sin of “anger” and began by putting an advertisement in The Village Voice that read, “What makes you angry?” Along with fellow filmmaker Joel Gold, she recorded the conversations with the people who replied. This exploration lead to a heart-wrenching and emotional film that shows the complexity of anger and its origins.  Thirty four years later, Anger continues to resonate, especially as health, economic and political turmoil place anger at the forefront.","popularity":0.1108,"poster_path":"/t2hFYoDHJ12W8mP2Wwa9gbYFc5V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1986-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495342,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Brilliant","original_name":"Robert Brilliant","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d55045be00e0067d56e61","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2256175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ethan Mass","original_name":"Ethan Mass","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d5544d7107e005380521e","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxi Cohen","original_name":"Maxi Cohen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ttCQX2G9tE6q65X1BEBfxWA46ie.jpg","credit_id":"624d52745be00e0051741696","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxi Cohen","original_name":"Maxi Cohen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ttCQX2G9tE6q65X1BEBfxWA46ie.jpg","credit_id":"624d54a9bb2602004fa06e15","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxi Cohen","original_name":"Maxi Cohen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ttCQX2G9tE6q65X1BEBfxWA46ie.jpg","credit_id":"624d54b4f495ee0052083f9f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Gold","original_name":"Joel Gold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d54de18864b006be749d5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495343,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ron Lieberman","original_name":"Ron Lieberman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d5539bb26020065fc22e0","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Gold","original_name":"Joel Gold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d54c30d1e7f00a6e8a7a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961608,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Trilling","original_name":"Peter Trilling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d54f3b2681f0054dbb32b","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1027,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eBO2D5ZvKHHwPOKVZSZcQ8Ccx9Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1825}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":901,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t2hFYoDHJ12W8mP2Wwa9gbYFc5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ANGER - Maxi Cohen (Trailer)","key":"ipxWVu5iKFo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-10-14T21:03:22.000Z","id":"624d5437c3926600642c9984"}]}}}
