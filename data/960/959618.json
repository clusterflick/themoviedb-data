This intimate film recounts the story of Benjamin and William Deng, brothers joined in the struggle of a seemingly never-ending exile, who are then separated when one is accepted into a United States resettlement program while the other remains in a Kenyan refugee camp. It is not only a film about the two brother's dreams and reality, it is also a film about war and suffering in their beloved South Sudan, lost childhood and innocence, the trials of life as a refugee in foreign lands and the existing realities of survival. Real life in the so called \"Land of dreams\" â€“ America, is not an easy adjustment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zxTtHOGLTJO5wjdhHbSnsAs2NRe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benjamin and His Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Howes","original_name":"Arthur Howes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624df92c6f43ec0099d16e46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":891,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zxTtHOGLTJO5wjdhHbSnsAs2NRe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
