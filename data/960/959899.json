A film  documenting a year in the life of skateboarding  sensation Oskar ‘Oski’ Rozenberg as he  transforms from cool street skater to celebrity  sportsman competing in the Olympics.  The demands of being a sportman with  a shot at the gold medal in Tokyo weighs  hard on Oski. It’s obvious that he is not your  everyday athlete. Can his sport, and his culture  survive the transition from underground to  mainstream? And will he loose himself and  everything dear to him in the process?  'Oski' explores the history of  a subculture at a pivotal point in its history  and how a humble and different thinking  athlete, loved and adored by thousands of  skateboarders all around the world, struggles  to find his own path in life as an adult and  sportsman.","popularity":0.7706,"poster_path":"/3s2BPQhkylOc0hVWeZC0v17lRlV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luckyday
