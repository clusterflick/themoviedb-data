The commentary partly takes up the language of the dock workers and blends wonderfully with the black and white photographs. The two together result in a precisely constructed reportage about work and leisure in the port environment and its social conditions. Three moving film sequences interrupt the photo sequence and thematize the photographic form.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tEIEKYxwZoqUL0sIoEPgkLMlZYm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Tag eines unständigen Hafenarbeiters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3495882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hubert Fichte","original_name":"Hubert Fichte","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yPuCM0PaYbjB1j605JSWi7RH5pB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"voice","credit_id":"6616c5f177c01f017ca4812a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3495885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonore Mau","original_name":"Leonore Mau","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4Dqvz8WBSQ3hAAGYCu12cO5Ni4r.jpg","credit_id":"624dde103d35570067459049","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3495882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hubert Fichte","original_name":"Hubert Fichte","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yPuCM0PaYbjB1j605JSWi7RH5pB.jpg","credit_id":"624dde0743999b009d0350c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3495885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonore Mau","original_name":"Leonore Mau","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4Dqvz8WBSQ3hAAGYCu12cO5Ni4r.jpg","credit_id":"6616c8100f1e58017d46a5b6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3495882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hubert Fichte","original_name":"Hubert Fichte","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yPuCM0PaYbjB1j605JSWi7RH5pB.jpg","credit_id":"6616c82b77c01f017ca4830c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":988,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tEIEKYxwZoqUL0sIoEPgkLMlZYm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":659},{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1030,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxIbfPm8qx96RLWDZ2owbbIuCBp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":737}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
