When they performed and recorded all nine Beethoven Symphonies at the Academia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, the nationwide Italian newspaper La Repubblica simply called it: “The most wonderful symphonic cycle of the past decade.” Each of the symphonies is of course a masterpiece in itself – each represents the composer’s musical idiom at a particular stage in his development. Be it the famous Pastorale, his 6th symphony, the popular 9th, with its characteristic motifs, the less commonly performed 4th or the 7th, which marked his leaning toward romantic undertones – Abbado’s interpretations are the fruit of decades of involvement with Beethoven.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":"/6jejHMm2rd1C0uTN2z0WJp7axMM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abbado – Beethoven: Symphonies 2 & 5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2897270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","original_name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Orchestra","credit_id":"664d910a894d4e07c70612f9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Abbado","original_name":"Claudio Abbado","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/v6zf1YHJ3gMAvQ5xmrTYkd4A12.jpg","credit_id":"664d90f882a2ffadf09ac0c7","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6jejHMm2rd1C0uTN2z0WJp7axMM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
