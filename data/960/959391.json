Shot over three days by leading opera director Brian Large, this recording benefits from the ideal technical conditions made possible by a closed session. Alden, one of the most iconoclastic interpreters of classical opera, stirs up the visionary, erotic, and archetypal elements in Wagner's work. The cold, forbidding aspect of the stylized and predominantly monochrome sets and costumes by Roni Toren and Buki Shiff manifests the strait-jacket of tradition from which Tannhäuser seeks to free himself in this powerful opera.","popularity":0.1673,"poster_path":"/zI58XcuIdKIuh8iheFpc51fIVvD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":193,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wagner: Tannhäuser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Kollo","original_name":"René Kollo","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/zUi9xsOeYwzEAXl8vlNG26BcRvg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tannhäuser","credit_id":"67193d605d0de89042d8cd44","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waltraud Meier","original_name":"Waltraud Meier","popularity":0.2063,"profile_path":"/pk4rLWSbJmsKqxkoYFPm16re0zC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Venus","credit_id":"67193d6c34c0fabd681c42f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Weikl","original_name":"Bernd Weikl","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/r8NkIhBstdKCq1FPqE1yn8sRVCu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Wolfram von Eschenbach","credit_id":"67193d9134c0fabd681c4312","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Secunde","original_name":"Nadine Secunde","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elisabeth","credit_id":"67193db434c0fabd681c4320","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan-Hendrik Rootering","original_name":"Jan-Hendrik Rootering","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hermann","credit_id":"67193dce5be9e8759da6bdc9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claes-Håkan Ahnsjö","original_name":"Claes-Håkan Ahnsjö","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Walther von der Vogelweide","credit_id":"67194035769107d77b4769b7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Günter Nöcker","original_name":"Hans Günter Nöcker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Biterolf","credit_id":"6719405a6e4210780f78a05c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Anderson","original_name":"James Anderson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Heinrich der Schreiber","credit_id":"6719408a6d6b705dc8711d6d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhard Auer","original_name":"Gerhard Auer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Reinmar von Zweter","credit_id":"671940a11ea33928297cde04","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Pohl","original_name":"Johannes Pohl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Hirt","credit_id":"671940b9e833d92ef05fbe29","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zubin Mehta","original_name":"Zubin Mehta","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":"/yqPAUNt9QLvLSLOBcVjXboe9s5W.jpg","credit_id":"67193de3e833d92ef05fbd9a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Alden","original_name":"David Alden","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67193dfee833d92ef05fbdb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zI58XcuIdKIuh8iheFpc51fIVvD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2209,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4cVTYjCrW76ZPTLDS5kj74P7FrU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1473}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TANNHÄUSER (Trailer) | Richard Wagner | David Alden | Zubin Mehta | Bayerisches Staatsorchester","key":"s00FhSsQvzw","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-08-30T12:18:21.000Z","id":"67193f541ea33928297cdd3e"}]}}}
