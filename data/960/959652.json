I have to say what I think.\" George Edelstein has always adhered to this principle: both in his former secular life and during his years of church service. A man of an amazing fate, complex as the century in which he had to live. Not a Soviet person in Soviet society. A connoisseur of freedom, who does not like being called a dissident. A village priest, to whom Ronald Reagan returned the parish, and whose son became an Israeli politician. A man who always spoke the truth – about the state that persecuted for the faith, and about the church hierarchs who participated in it. \"My duty is not to be silent. In silence, I am convinced, God is surrendered.\"","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Duty is Not to Be Silent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"ОБЯЗАННОСТЬ – НЕ МОЛЧАТЬ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1950470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Kara-Murza","original_name":"Vladimir Kara-Murza","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/tkpPxj2cmH1fOertvNJb31bTGsy.jpg","credit_id":"624e1e776f6a990065d045a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
