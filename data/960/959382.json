Sharing one of the recurrent stylistic motifs of the Georgian documentaries shown here, an uncanny atmosphere is created by the use of post-production sound and chiaroscuro lighting. In effect, the removal of the bread from the oven is witnessed with the same sense of wonder as would greet the appearance of a flying saucer. When sticking the dough to the tandoor, the baker moves half of his body into this dungeon – an image at once frightening and mesmerising. Nowhere else has bread been seen like this, save perhaps for Night of the Living Bread (Kevin S. O’Brien, 1990). But this is hardly a parody: here the most essential human foodstuff meets an expressionist sensibility. In fact, along with Manoel de Oliveira’s O Pão (also showing this year), Khabazebi presents some of the most beautiful images of our daily bread on screen.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/aTUHds4QcEaw4UQtHYwKxEdmCfj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1970-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bread Makers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Хлебопёки","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495402,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nutsa Shoshitaishvili","original_name":"Nutsa Shoshitaishvili","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d62374cbe120065b9ed87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bidzina Rachvelishvili","original_name":"Bidzina Rachvelishvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d61dcf495ee0052085072","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liana Gogelia","original_name":"Liana Gogelia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d6246abdafc0064421a8a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034422,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gia Badridze","original_name":"გია ბადრიძე","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d61f14cbe120065b9ed19","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273426,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tsiuri Koberidze","original_name":"Tsiuri Koberidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d622772a2c90069615825","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495400,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tristan Kandelaki","original_name":"ტრისტან კანდელაკი","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d62194cbe1200985841a7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495399,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giorgi Barnaveli","original_name":"Giorgi Barnaveli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624d620718864b006be75e56","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTUHds4QcEaw4UQtHYwKxEdmCfj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"In cinemas nationwide","release_date":"1970-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
