The other boys haven't exactly tried to understand why Dad opened up his family's home to Miyeko, a survivor of the Hiroshima Atomic bomb. Although she is only in America a short time to have surgery on her badly scarred face and arm, her visit reveals just how many ignorant and intolerant attitudes still exist 10 years after the war's end. But Johnny, who also resents Miyeko at first, becomes one of her fiercest defenders after he makes the effort to look past her outward appearance. Only then can the scars begin to heal.","popularity":1.4762,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Emotional scars are always the last to heal.","title":"Hiroshima Maiden","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Blakely","original_name":"Susan Blakely","popularity":0.7339,"profile_path":"/xfl66Wa4LYdcRwoXd9ojn8V55eF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Betty Bennett","credit_id":"55bba1ca9251413e5500014e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamlyn Tomita","original_name":"Tamlyn Tomita","popularity":1.0115,"profile_path":"/jiopYBG0cpYcPmHa1KL6F24bd99.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Miyeko","credit_id":"55bba1e1c3a368653400017d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Dorff","original_name":"Stephen Dorff","popularity":2.4779,"profile_path":"/kuFyGa2HZB7hAQTUn3WKlgKAVjm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Johnny Bennett","credit_id":"55bba1f1c3a368652d00015f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Masur","original_name":"Richard Masur","popularity":0.8558,"profile_path":"/trGcCjXEF6GfgrTtsOaTIOxafAu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jim Bennett","credit_id":"55bba201c3a368652600013b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Masterson","original_name":"Christopher Masterson","popularity":1.0151,"profile_path":"/hOq2XG7QNtYphFcokFpJNPv4k4q.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Timmy Bennett","credit_id":"55bba2209251413e4f000119","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Morrison","original_name":"Kenny Morrison","popularity":0.2027,"profile_path":"/xr6UwL1daWK7RT2h6qq6J3aOpjc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ted Latimer","credit_id":"55bba247c3a368654000017b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Haskins","original_name":"Dennis Haskins","popularity":0.2292,"profile_path":"/kC7SeTVT9WQlGGiWpgCn2ovjYUx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hal Latimer","credit_id":"55bba2629251413e4f00011f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Crane","original_name":"Brandon Crane","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/yq0u6rVADruGtndJ8fgid8KY0nL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"55bba2819251413e5100015d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bacall","original_name":"Michael Bacall","popularity":0.3405,"profile_path":"/500hUpJJcIRknF6d3rBzzwJiKuU.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"55bba290c3a3686540000189","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1216927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.
