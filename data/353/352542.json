Albany talks about the great musicians and singers he worked with - Billie Holliday and Charlie Parker among them - and how so many succumbed to drugs and died young. He is followed around at home, work, on the bus, and in other settings as he is interviewed by director Carole Langer. His sharp observations and dry sense of humor enliven the stories.","popularity":0.1814,"poster_path":"/6z77SmKpKAAX2PAVaShT2Nvn1CK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Albany: A Jazz Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Albany","original_name":"Joe Albany","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uLfBQQWQWga1HXDurfmHaYEsxoT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55bc1b0cc3a3686534000e32","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492487,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonathon Smith","original_name":"Jonathon Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bc1a229251413e4b000c5e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1492488,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Schenkein","original_name":"Michael Schenkein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bc1a649251413e49000c65","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristin Van Buren","original_name":"Kristin Van Buren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bc1a9a9251413e51000d02","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carole Langer","original_name":"Carole Langer","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bc19e19251413e4b000c4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0080965","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mKIWPh93fu2GG5zokP5lL7IhPm7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6z77SmKpKAAX2PAVaShT2Nvn1CK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"JOE ALBANY...
