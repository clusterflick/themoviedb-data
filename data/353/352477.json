Adults don’t usually believe in talking dogs, but Max is certain that the tip from the would-be assassin’s pet dog is a sure thing. As he and his human and animal friends set out to put a stop to the sinister plan, his parents, the police, and even his bodyguard discredit his suspicion. When Agent Clyde finally begins to catch on, time is running out, and they must act quickly to save the president’s life. The story reminds us that doing the right thing isn’t always easy, and heroes come in all sizes.","popularity":1.4941,"poster_path":"/93rwwqWD3OsL5eM86igzOYdtabT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Undercover Kid","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"How I Saved the President","type":"video title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Pierce","original_name":"Bradley Pierce","popularity":0.8385,"profile_path":"/j6iW0vVA23GQniAPSYI6mi4hiEW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Max Anderson","credit_id":"55bbb4ab9251413e4b0002db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melora Hardin","original_name":"Melora Hardin","popularity":1.5958,"profile_path":"/ymH5zoBrtEfFWIkgKAhiEbtiAg4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clyde","credit_id":"55bbb4b69251413e490002bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Surovy","original_name":"Nicolas Surovy","popularity":0.2879,"profile_path":"/zePSB2dRIumv9nb7xjYvRZYfikQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ronald Andersson","credit_id":"55bbb4d0c3a368652200031a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1492238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Dolan Stevens","original_name":"Susan Dolan Stevens","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/fLqri2AlkMuf6muj6UhsKF1A23D.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miranda Andersson","credit_id":"55bbb4e59251413e4b0002e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erick Avari","original_name":"Erick Avari","popularity":1.236,"profile_path":"/aO53uKgLUCID9rCI0SRAIEdsIex.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Brach","credit_id":"55bbb4f99251413e490002c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trishalee Hardy","original_name":"Trishalee Hardy","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Buzzy","credit_id":"55bbb5149251413e510002f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Knepper","original_name":"Robert Knepper","popularity":3.1062,"profile_path":"/lRncjvgCIm1muIkK94zJSH2i3d6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bo the Dog","credit_id":"55bbb527c3a3686522000323","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Jackson","original_name":"Victoria Jackson","popularity":0.381,"profile_path":"/mMTqZkTARaZzEtRlz60MRvK0jnw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nellie the Cat","credit_id":"55bbb5369251413e5b0002de","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven-Ole Thorsen","original_name":"Sven-Ole Thorsen","popularity":0.4407,"profile_path":"/7uhBGHXs6xLwFwzWbLEsHDgYzHP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Terrorist #1","credit_id":"55bbb546c3a368654000035d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42824,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carl Ciarfalio","original_name":"Carl Ciarfalio","popularity":0.2468,"profile_path":"/yADROfK7uJkmd8p3GyjxH8WZqRL.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Terrorist #2","credit_id":"55bbb55c9251413e5b0002e3","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Shayne","original_name":"Linda Shayne","popularity":0.1794,"profile_path":"/giUmKpvZSTqB3ibuFvspeKZBR1U.jpg","credit_id":"55bbb47b9251413e580002c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384429,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dennis Carr","original_name":"Dennis Carr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bbb48bc3a36865390002a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113345","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1856,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93rwwqWD3OsL5eM86igzOYdtabT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1237}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11477,"name":"anthropomorphism"},{"id":14548,"name":"political assassination"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
