Based on Carcase for Hounds, Meja Mwangi's novel about the Mau-Mau uprising, it is set in an unnamed country and thus offers the vision of a pan-African struggle for freedom and against colonial oppression. The central figures in the straightforwardly and powerfully told story are the guerrilla leader Haraka and his adversary, the English colonial official Kingsley. In the end, the film becomes a homage to the freedom fighters from all over Africa: the final images show Patrice Lumumba, Steve Biko, Nelson Mandela and Amílcar Cabral, among others.","popularity":0.3713,"poster_path":"/w6mJIevAEYcL5DxTrIxijRA6JWL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afrocult Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yoruba","iso_639_1":"yo","name":"Èdè Yorùbá"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Our people shall be free","title":"Cry Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Hall","original_name":"Albert Hall","popularity":0.3544,"profile_path":"/jvcOpEO0vSNy3KaDkhIldI1CoaU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Haraka","credit_id":"55be842f9251413bdc003a29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prunella Gee","original_name":"Prunella Gee","popularity":0.2055,"profile_path":"/aVSzbMDDqqGSQyrUBljlSxBNbuA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Susan","credit_id":"55be844cc3a3686526004bf3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Coutinho","original_name":"Jorge Coutinho","popularity":0.0781,"profile_path":"/elm3bCrizUocl6x4DgN8sADLnKG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kimano","credit_id":"5a81730a0e0a262aa603215a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Pirillo","original_name":"Roberto Pirillo","popularity":0.2184,"profile_path":"/wEXETSnhSIPDG7Ael6rjEYA23OK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a81732f0e0a262ab2032651","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Buck","original_name":"David Buck","popularity":0.3849,"profile_path":"/ruU1fqPWT4lvaBTyrUlne1H2Dkz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a81733d0e0a262aa603219e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ola Balogun","original_name":"Ola Balogun","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/sjDp5A8WIqHEWBEmhir8WqzMu6w.jpg","credit_id":"55be839d9251413e58004e8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ola Balogun","original_name":"Ola Balogun","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/sjDp5A8WIqHEWBEmhir8WqzMu6w.jpg","credit_id":"55be83a6c3a3686526004be3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157981,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Gosselet","original_name":"Philippe Gosselet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a817373c3a368189a031952","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1976707,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Meja Mwangi","original_name":"Meja Mwangi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a81735fc3a36818930333a8","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0082218","wikidata_id":"Q113321788","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":932,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6mJIevAEYcL5DxTrIxijRA6JWL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
