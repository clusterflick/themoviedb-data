Starrett plays Texas Ranger Steve Martin, who is dispatched to a \"renegade\" Texas country that refuses to become part of the good old USA. He discovers that the crux of the problem is a local tax collector who, with the help of a crooked newspaper editor, is systematically robbing the citizens of their hard-earned cash, all the while fomenting anti-American sentiments.","popularity":1.1783,"poster_path":"/qrLZaUIk3L3AWFXsa13AeGHOr6v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia
