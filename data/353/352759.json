The repeated ritual of Tutuguri that Tranquilino the saweame sang and danced six times in a short, strictly accurate duration. Secret words from which only emerge vowels, dance that builds a sacred space between the four cardinal points of a cross, a black and pagan sign. A native solar rite, prior to the Spanish conquest. The assembly here builds in a single plane the two poles of real time and an expanded space-time, from dual material: Tutuguri and Carreras.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1980-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tutuguri: Tarahumaras 79","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymonde Carasco","original_name":"Raymonde Carasco","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/1xochGVGe7BYbVWh8goACDfEvxI.jpg","credit_id":"55be780c9251413e5500529c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymonde Carasco","original_name":"Raymonde Carasco","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/1xochGVGe7BYbVWh8goACDfEvxI.jpg","credit_id":"5d5270e66f974600129bdb3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5219370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival International du Jeune Cinéma de Hyères","release_date":"1980-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
