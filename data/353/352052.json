He becomes the lover of Sonia, a young woman painter, a lover at heart of course. But Sonia has a provincial friend, Clotilde. One day, Clotilde pays Bona a visit. As she has just come into a large inheritance, Laurent courts her and marries her. The young couple embark on a misguided life of easy pleasures and questionable company. Clotilde's nerves crack at this game. Among Laurent's acquaintances, François, a doctor, treats her in his clinic: sleep cure, rest, etc. Meanwhile, Laurent distracts himself with other women. But Clotilde, convalescing, refuses to resume life together. Laurent turns to his former mistress, Sonia.","popularity":0.1656,"poster_path":"/AebbwD0GKtdBPVsroacIweya7TO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hoche
