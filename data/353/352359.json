Less than three years later, he founded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that today has 14 million followers and is the 4th largest religious denomination in the United States. Plates of Gold follows Joseph's early adult years and portrays the events that lead up to the publishing of The Book of Mormon and the founding of a new worldwide church.
