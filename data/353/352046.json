Based on the famous Ginga Tetsudou no Yoru story written by Kenji Miyazawa in the early 20th century, Kagaya, a digital fine artist, has breathed new life into the unique imaginary world using creativity and precise astronomical knowledge.  The starry sky is depicted as the Celestial Field made up of a river, a field of silver grasses, flowers, birds, survey towers, railway signals and more. Across this amazing beautiful scenery, the Celestial Railroad runs along the Milky Way.  It is a fantasy world in full colour, but designed with scientific accuracy.","popularity":0.8906,"poster_path":"/zoYMryPYXd821Ce27rzhCVFfbpx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Ultimate Splendor - A fusion of Scientific Accuracy and Rich Imagination","title":"The Celestial Railroad","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Ginga Tetsudou no Yoru","type":"Romanji"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Celestial Railroad","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Night on the Galactic Railroad","type":"Direct Translation"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Το Τραίνο της Φαντασίας","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shigeru Muroi","original_name":"室井滋","popularity":0.3408,"profile_path":"/83lMnQ6vW1ZhzNH4xOVPcwA5su2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cdc3f2fc3a3680fd4c51a00","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Houko Kuwashima","original_name":"桑島法子","popularity":1.0927,"profile_path":"/uZSmoh5jSdLwmkLaCnC3Xju6TTN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cdc3f479251417660ceadea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahito Ohba","original_name":"大場真人","popularity":0.1809,"profile_path":"/dixAhT3V3dplrNeppKi4ifTGfVp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5cdc3f5b0e0a2627a0cc15ee","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491317,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kagaya Rei","original_name":"Kagaya Rei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b7f29092514123e4000097","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2313307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kagaya","original_name":"Kagaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cdc3a900e0a26407dd2cc7b","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kenji Miyazawa","original_name":"宮沢賢治","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/aWoaquu9iPtivR1kJ4lybbSTzbe.jpg","credit_id":"5cdc39650e0a2627a0cc0873","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2313307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kagaya","original_name":"Kagaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cdc3a630e0a26045cd0cf41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0871988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d0KUr8oLtU1moYnktiGDeZniQ3b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eL6e2pLJ3mbGN6I5M2Ku2GrwXv8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zoYMryPYXd821Ce27rzhCVFfbpx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":18256,"name":"spiritual"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Planetarium","release_date":"2006-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer of \"The Celestial Railroad\"(English version)by KAGAYA Studio","key":"9nrYfnExZwc","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-03-16T03:17:43.000Z","id":"5cdc3ad50e0a263868d36147"}]}}}
