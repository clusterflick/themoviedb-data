At the centre is Alpha, whose scepticism about fixed appellations is also expressed in his own chosen name. In his Parisian garret, the characters debate politics, art and philosophy and negotiate Black identity and cultural heritage. The action continues on its improvised way in the cafés, parks and nightclubs of Paris until Alpha finds himself between the fireworks and the celebrating masses on Bastille Day – in the middle and yet on the margins.","popularity":0.1705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Campbell","original_name":"James Campbell","popularity":0.0781,"profile_path":"/vBgCVTJa3Ey2cD5WGx9Syyk1Jm2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3e2671c3a368506600b42d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia X.","original_name":"Emilia X.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3e2678925141144c008415","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimi Solanke","original_name":"Jimi Solanke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3e2681925141145b0077fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Hutson","original_name":"Bill Hutson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3e268b925141148f009830","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay Barrett","original_name":"Lindsay Barrett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3e26af925141145f008de9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ola Balogun","original_name":"Ola Balogun","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/sjDp5A8WIqHEWBEmhir8WqzMu6w.jpg","credit_id":"55bc8546c3a3686526001a56","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ola Balogun","original_name":"Ola Balogun","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/sjDp5A8WIqHEWBEmhir8WqzMu6w.jpg","credit_id":"55bc853dc3a3686534001f3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0069691","wikidata_id":"Q113320435","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
