Gustavo Dudamel, an awestruck fan of the musical icon, led the orchestra in a crosssection of Maestro Williams' matchless canon. Featuring Itzhak Perlman with a very special musical performance of pieces from Schindler's List as well as the Cadenza and variations from Fiddler on the Roof. Jazz elements will fill the air during Escapades from Catch Me if You Can, and may the force be with you during the iconic tunes from Star Wars.","popularity":0.2501,"poster_path":"/zqLcpABYs1PEyu9jx7EHMTHL5Ih.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bernhard Fleischer Moving
