His misguided priorities are soon challenged when he encounters a mysterious little girl. That girl takes Dickens on a strange and moving journey in which he is shown the future he could have if he doesn't change his ways and, more importantly, he is shown a better purpose for his writing as a way of speaking for the oppressed who need his help. It is these events and lessons that would inspire Dickens to write an extraordinary Christmas tale that would become his greatest work, A Christmas Carol.","popularity":0.5978,"poster_path":"/5gtMO4N5wqRAZOfsf5FogFWlQB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The untold story of a simple act of charity","title":"The Ghosts of Dickens' Past","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Heyerdahl","original_name":"Christopher Heyerdahl","popularity":1.3953,"profile_path":"/pTPZa3TFIkxRbqM5adXYE51a99s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Charles Dickens","credit_id":"55bbd2bbc3a3686528000447","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Bertram","original_name":"Jennifer Bertram","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Muffin","credit_id":"55bbd2e49251413e49000524","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Calabretta","original_name":"Tony Calabretta","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/jPnLqwPZ9AE01fNOBd8hVngGC3v.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cabbie","credit_id":"55bbd2f19251413e5e000532","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Cavalier","original_name":"Jason Cavalier","popularity":0.4685,"profile_path":"/tBiNgNX2gbj06mQg0Lm4ElNCjt4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Thug","credit_id":"55bbd301c3a368652800044d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patricia Lavoie","original_name":"Patricia Lavoie","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bbd2a7c3a368652200055d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Neibaur","original_name":"Bruce Neibaur","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bbd29b9251413e550005c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2468535,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kurt Bestor","original_name":"Kurt Bestor","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/zAq90QAOdjyjgFLX072FPOkeKEh.jpg","credit_id":"603b43254d67917688bd7d97","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0174683","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AkOPK6OrnvZ2JTYoPSpnBWkYfS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1130,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5gtMO4N5wqRAZOfsf5FogFWlQB8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":786},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1182,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4vznjW00ea3g0B6WZh0pb1PTvki.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":788}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
