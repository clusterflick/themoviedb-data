Now living in Afghanistan's remote, Taliban-infested Jalalabad province, Gittoes turns his attention to the lives of the children and outcasts of this war-torn land.  In Snow Monkey, Gittoes paints a portrait of a Jalalabad seething with humanity, adversity and hope â€“ focusing on three gangs of children: the Ghostbusters, persecuted Kochi boys who hawk exorcisms of bad luck and demons; the Snow Monkeys, who sell ice cream to support their families; and the Gangsters, a razor gang led by a nine-year-old antihero called Steel, terrifying to the core but still capable of experiencing aspects of the childhood seemingly taken from him.  With a deeply humane vision that won him the Sydney Peace Prize, Gittoes shows us the unseen nature of Afghanistan's politics, culture and society, up close and startlingly personal.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/5r6LSFXFSxS15LQFa0r3AAJX4V8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One of Australia's greatest photojournalists takes you on a riveting first-hand journey through an Afghanistan you'll never see on the news.","title":"Snow Monkey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Gittoes","original_name":"George Gittoes","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55be1f4c9251413e55004a58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4968400","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5r6LSFXFSxS15LQFa0r3AAJX4V8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1344}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
