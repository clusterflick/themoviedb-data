The island is a magnet for the scum of the earth, as well as a few honest guys who were framed. Into this den of iniquity swims socialite Dorothy Sebastian, who jumped off a yacht after apparently murdering her lecherous host. To remain on the Island, Sebastian is told that she must pay $5,000 to head honcho Fred Kohler -- and if she hasn't got the money, it is implied, there are other methods of collection.","popularity":1.2141,"poster_path":"/yMl1CEtyM0P7otxd77nqNpnB58L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showmen's Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship of Wanted Men","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Sebastian","original_name":"Dorothy Sebastian","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/3soMuXtGrf2v4haxG07xLNd94Wd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Irene Reynolds","credit_id":"55bd48039251413e5b002e60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Kohler","original_name":"Fred Kohler","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/lrJamRnwOSFxXUzEDbPiZvoRMxG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chuck Young","credit_id":"55bd480d9251413e58002fab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Ames","original_name":"Leon Ames","popularity":0.3928,"profile_path":"/QyNQUvF8jD6sNdBY0a3O3hgLSQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Holden","credit_id":"55bd48169251413e5b002e64","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Astor","original_name":"Gertrude Astor","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":"/jjIoqFS6mmfZFlhX8pcBhPVzIBJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vera","credit_id":"55bd4823c3a36869590035b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Black","original_name":"Maurice Black","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/1HQfoFmDIXwxE1e3sugCjJnTQQh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"George Spinoli","credit_id":"56e47444c3a3685a9a003eb1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Flavin","original_name":"James Flavin","popularity":0.3006,"profile_path":"/zF6D2GWaLx2TyRm4qDTqwCk6JWg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Frank Busch","credit_id":"56e4745192514109d800297a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Robards Sr.","original_name":"Jason Robards Sr.","popularity":0.3321,"profile_path":"/bTAO5oYzTCYc62FJ27Ivei0KAAl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"John Craig","credit_id":"56e47460c3a3685a9e0041bc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Evans","original_name":"Herbert Evans","popularity":0.166,"profile_path":"/tL2j1O5smA8WOdHgvrG2b1ifhdb.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Duke Finley","credit_id":"56e4746cc3a3685a9a003eb8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ince","original_name":"John Ince","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/rkU9NusaUKHsrXoCYS1ZneuTnDD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Elderly Man","credit_id":"56e4747992514103c5000bd1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kit Guard","original_name":"Kit Guard","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":"/bFd7gdZlPlJYjVZ3t5rDrmh01dx.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Crewman","credit_id":"56e47486c3a3685aa8003e28","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George 'Gabby' Hayes","original_name":"George 'Gabby' Hayes","popularity":0.5123,"profile_path":"/fnTYZNc8Vy7lLJs3xl5GWSHGVSA.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Crewman","credit_id":"56e4749792514109d8002988","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis D.
