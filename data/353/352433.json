Mol. In the film, the crystallization processes of various chemicals are shown. There are different versions of Uit het rijk der kristallen: the original silent film was given a soundtrack in the 1930s, and there is a colour version of the film which was made ​​using Dufay colour. A clip from the film, or other shots of identical crystallization processes, can be seen in Mol’s other films. The film was not only screened at educational and scientific presentations, but also resonated within avant-garde circles. The film was screened at the first show presented by the Harlem branch of the Filmliga. This was followed by a screening at Amsterdam’s Filmliga, and at ‘Studio 28’ in Paris. There, the film was screened as a ‘triptyque’, with three projectors side by side.","popularity":0.3676,"poster_path":"/oKxnAoxXqIMFqAhGqq3MERcG3zo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59776,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bureau voor Wetenschappelijke Cinematografie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Realm of the Crystals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1492122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Cornelis Mol","original_name":"Jan Cornelis Mol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nvaoWKB4dhVjo6SH5wxcJYN3jbm.jpg","credit_id":"55bb87bc92514123dd008210","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1492122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Cornelis Mol","original_name":"Jan Cornelis Mol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nvaoWKB4dhVjo6SH5wxcJYN3jbm.jpg","credit_id":"55bb80a5c3a3684aed008461","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492150,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Pointl","original_name":"Christian Pointl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60385dadc4ad590028e1a751","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oKxnAoxXqIMFqAhGqq3MERcG3zo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":174440,"name":"time lapse photography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
