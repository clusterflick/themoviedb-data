The man immediately moves in. The only thing he brings with him - hidden under a cloth - is a large cage. Acting against the man's express warning, the couple goes up to his room when he is away. Their curiosity costs both them and the tenant dearly.","popularity":0.221,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ventus Film","origin_country":""},{"id":12023,"logo_path":"/97tVKGqnkjn0hwTGGRDPRgYWbrE.png","name":"NPS","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geluk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romijn Conen","original_name":"Romijn Conen","popularity":0.1743,"profile_path":"/m8sZKJIP7VzoTi5eLfIK3RFOEJM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55bd25cec3a3686959003215","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":210979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joop Keesmaat","original_name":"Joop Keesmaat","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/hI5OTaNl1k47tuhw4RnXga78c0B.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55bd25d4c3a368652800257b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tjitske Reidinga","original_name":"Tjitske Reidinga","popularity":0.2881,"profile_path":"/sYooxbK7yor71Q14KnguI981Um8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55bd25dc9251413bed0014b5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karin S. de Boer","original_name":"Karin S. de Boer","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bd2605c3a3683921001320","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ram贸n Gieling","original_name":"Ram贸n Gieling","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bd25f79251413bed0014b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ram贸n Gieling","original_name":"Ram贸n Gieling","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bd25ef9251413e5b002b06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1492736,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Erwin Roodhart","original_name":"Erwin Roodhart","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bd26139251413e58002c58","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0763309","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11320,"name":"tenant"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
