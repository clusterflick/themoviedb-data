Fed up with the culture of motocross racing, he along with his friends set out to create a new sport. The high-stakes, often death-defying world of freestyle motocross was born and took fans of extreme sports by storm. Though Linkogle rose to legendary status with his record-breaking stunts and rock-and-roll lifestyle, his inner demons and self-destructive behavior eventually led to his demise. Narrated by Motorhead front man Lemmy Kilmister, Mind of the Demon is a morbidly fascinating look into Linkogle's brilliant yet haunted psyche. Through incredible archive footage and interviews with colorful characters and top dirt bike competitors, this award-winning documentary rebuilds the thrilling story of the birth of freestyle motocross. Past and present intertwine and drive Linkogle's story towards two possible conclusions: glorious comeback or nosedive into self-destruction.","popularity":0.9126,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":251555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lone Gut Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mind of a Demon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lemmy Kilmister","original_name":"Lemmy Kilmister","popularity":0.7451,"profile_path":"/bEwvOeeB8YBBO29eAwGNK5oucnc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67979238702f492f478f50a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Adams","original_name":"Nate Adams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wFTsePVDrsa65ggq5nmuDawbV80.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67978f40a6e41283f12b3b84","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carey Hart","original_name":"Carey Hart","popularity":0.1708,"profile_path":"/vM43fEY0CCfPpbiSRJOnhysaRIN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679791ed013209f8918f5d5e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Emig","original_name":"Jeff Emig","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679790b23f7fcf67d08f62c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Enslow","original_name":"Seth Enslow","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679790f5702f492f478f4ffa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Freeman","original_name":"Jon Freeman","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6797917b9ca029099c2b145f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trigger Gumm","original_name":"Trigger Gumm","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679791b325d2980fb0241d00","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930093,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Linkogle","original_name":"Larry Linkogle","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679792d4013209f8918f5dd1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5206944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Manley","original_name":"Beau Manley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67979315760f51e17d2b3f28","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy McGrath","original_name":"Jeremy McGrath","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67979329013209f8918f5e2f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Metzger","original_name":"Mike Metzger","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67979362760f51e17d2b3f69","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4232917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Molenkamp","original_name":"Hans Molenkamp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67979387702f492f478f5118","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82571,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dana Nicholson","original_name":"Dana Nicholson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679793f6d4ba1725f12b30bd","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Barker","original_name":"Adam Barker","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67978ef5760f51e17d2b3e50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Barker","original_name":"Adam Barker","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67978f010a30d6d059241961","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1340112","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
