An incubator for black pride and intellect, it taught values, discipline, and life skills to generations of black children. This is the story of that remarkable school, as told by Bordentown alumni, historians, and remarkable archival footage. It is also the story of black education in America across three centuries, presenting a nuanced, rarely seen portrait of a separate black space; and a much-needed preface to the growing national discussion about historically black institutions and their role in nurturing identity and accomplishment. What was lost and what was gained in the march toward equality?","popularity":0.3268,"poster_path":"/rkfVWsDPpHWKsYag6DY5ScDd52f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Place Out of Time: The Bordentown School","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruby Dee","original_name":"Ruby Dee","popularity":0.7793,"profile_path":"/eRRRVQTLkH3RU9inzRHJqWdIZkW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"659059751dcb776c2c44c2ae","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Davidson","original_name":"Dave Davidson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590594e64f716662d8eaf22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1458397","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rkfVWsDPpHWKsYag6DY5ScDd52f.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
