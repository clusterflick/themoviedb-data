Using a recreation of Marcel Duchamp's Etant Donnes, a trickster of old mythology awakens Maria Martins (played by Kim Gordon) from the dream state. She learns that her lover, a captive Marcel Duchamp, has been kidnapped by a group of terrorists and forced to recite the chess moves to a historical match. Maria must enter a deep and strange rabbit hole to save her love.","popularity":0.1782,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une Danse Des Bouffons","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Bulette","original_name":"Jon Bulette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Bull God","credit_id":"53af7c2ac3a3682edb00451c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carin Cahn","original_name":"Carin Cahn","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Etant Donnes","credit_id":"53af7c3fc3a3682ef10043a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Gordon","original_name":"Kim Gordon","popularity":0.3585,"profile_path":"/QxhtVBFDKFVn6loMj9a1AqNmUv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maria Martins","credit_id":"53af7c4fc3a3682ee20046c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Grisell","original_name":"Jason Grisell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hhWjc8klPUUzLfm19GAZ2QlIj4l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marcel Duchamp","credit_id":"53af7c5fc3a3682eee0043d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannelore Knuts","original_name":"Hannelore Knuts","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/sr0klVuYfAXuQYD5bGx7jVO0MwL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maria Martins","credit_id":"53af7c76c3a3682ef10043a9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Dzama","original_name":"Marcel Dzama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53af7c13c3a3682edb004513","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3925462,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vanessa Walters","original_name":"Vanessa Walters","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f1313c524978008efd2938","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3531514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Marcel Dzama - \"Une danse des bouffons (or A jester's dance)\"","key":"2kAfSPOjr9M","published_at":"2013-08-15T01:49:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53af7c00c3a3682ef1004398"}]}}}
