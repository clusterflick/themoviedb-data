They usually spend time in a local pub playing cards, drinking and yelling. Jure is the most successful and bragging among them, while Klempo is considered poorest since he didn't built the house or bought a car. Annoyed by poor cards, Klempo places a bet with Jure that he made more money than him. The loser must give everything to winner and then walk around the town naked.","popularity":0.1693,"poster_path":"/ub9iVEMZjZEJVJqugRxgfnbGy8c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26327,"logo_path":null,"name":"FRZ
