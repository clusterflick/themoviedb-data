It takes the viewer to the early Edison days when moving images of a man walking or sneezing were a novelty. Schwartz combines those historical sequences with contemporary animation to comment on the progress of movie-making in the twentieth century. This \"how-to animation\" with its \"tongue-in-cheek\" mix of live action, animation and xerography serves as an introduction to the concept of structuralism.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2UHIagrUoWUC9JILlklMbhP2ZQQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Schwartz","original_name":"Gary Schwartz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ae8184c3a3682ef1003137","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":993,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2UHIagrUoWUC9JILlklMbhP2ZQQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":699}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
