He drives a semi, plays the guitar and raps. Sandman looks like Woody Guthrie but sings like LL Cool J. Roll Out, Cowboy follows the 39-year-old country/hip-hop musician as he tours the American West, performing for rural towns who might not have heard hip-hop before. We witness bank break-ups and town groupies: even a brief flirtation with truck-driving. Sandman's story is the struggle of an artist trying to make a buck. In a tough economy, can your American dream still carry a tune?","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roll Out, Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Lawrence","original_name":"Elizabeth Lawrence","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5649f337c3a368260100b96d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1522267","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
