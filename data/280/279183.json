The seventh generation of their family's business, they are descendants of the buraku people, a social minority held over from the caste system abolished in the 19th century that is still subject to discrimination. As the Kitades are forced to make the difficult decision to shut down their slaughterhouse, the question posed by the film is whether doing this will also result in the deconstruction of the prejudices imposed on them. Though primarily documenting the process of their work with meticulous detail, Aya Hanabusa also touches on the Kitades' participation in the buraku liberation movement. Hanabusa's heartfelt portrait expands from the story of an old-fashioned family business competing with corporate supermarkets, toward a subtle and sophisticated critique of social exclusion and the persistence of ancient prejudices.","popularity":0.2878,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":151650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pole Pole Times","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of a Butcher Shop","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Aru Seinikuten no Hanashi","type":"Japanese"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tale of a Butcher Shop","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793672,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Junpei Sakuma","original_name":"Junpei Sakuma","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e0a67fd4a960066aeee31","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547375,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chizuna Okubo","original_name":"Chizuna Okubo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e09f8873f000066c1a921","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seiichi Motohashi","original_name":"Seiichi Motohashi","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e09a65aadc413646795d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600835,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kunihiko Ukai","original_name":"Kunihiko Ukai","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lpzOMJuBuxRuEh0iAV5FFIC8hVg.jpg","credit_id":"62a6b3f37f6c8d58eaf31975","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aya Hanabusa","original_name":"Aya Hanabusa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53afa17a0e0a265979005ace","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3385796","wikidata_id":"Q131274962","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6069,"name":"class"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Tale of a Butcher Shop\" trailer (English subtitles) JAPAN CUTS 2014","key":"moULTJL28us","published_at":"2014-06-11T14:45:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53afa1c10e0a265979005ad7"}]}}}
