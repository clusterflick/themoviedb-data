This is the classic Oscar Peterson Trio, considered by many to be the best Oscar Peterson Band ever. Oscar and the trio collaborate with trumpeters Clark Terry (Finland'65) and Roy Eldridge (Sweden'63) and re-create some of the excitement and fun of the Jazz at the Philharmonic (JATP) tours. Among the many highlights in this collection are the Oscar and vocalist-trumpeter Clark Terry collaboration on the ever-popular Mumbles ,and for the first time on commercial video, an Oscar Peterson Trio rendition of Tonight from his award-winning West Side Story album.","popularity":0.1278,"poster_path":"/djuP3jE9bda0RrwEohGyCRjEBGB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Icons: Oscar Peterson Live in '63, '64 & '65","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Peterson","original_name":"Oscar Peterson","popularity":0.3576,"profile_path":"/jqwITu95Ma2j3mMZYfWV1H9ULTQ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53af60820e0a2659750054ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Brown","original_name":"Ray Brown","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53af60ac0e0a26598000552a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Thigpen","original_name":"Ed Thigpen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53af60c60e0a26597d005503","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Terry","original_name":"Clark Terry","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/r9Cu8i1akRtnwCL9nhk7dxLw5Mw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53af60e10e0a265980005534","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gXpSnHApodgGAE1hP1z6GrsH09X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djuP3jE9bda0RrwEohGyCRjEBGB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
