This film is presumed lost. In this black comedy scene, the bottom falls out of a coffin, the corpse tumble out, and is jolted back to life. Short sequences like this, as well as street scenes and dancing geisha girls were the main subjects of early Nippon cinema, pioneered by Shiro Asano and Shibata Tsunekichi from 1897 onwards. In creating dramatic, scenes, film-makers naturally chose the most striking or bizarre. Another undocumented film, recalled by cameraman Shiro Asano.","popularity":0.3044,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145823,"logo_path":null,"name":"Konishi Honten","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1898-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resurrection of a Corpse","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Shinin no sosei","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2899444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soujiro Sugiura","original_name":"Soujiro Sugiura","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Coffin Bearer","credit_id":"5fdd31894a4bfc003e7337b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2899449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kobayashi Sugiura","original_name":"Kobayashi Sugiura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Coffin Bearer","credit_id":"5fdd3247d7107e003cc626fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2899447,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eijiro Hatta","original_name":"Eijiro Hatta","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dead Man","credit_id":"5fdd3262bbe1dd00421a99b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461508,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shiro Asano","original_name":"Shiro Asano","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cf8f252d37210042285d92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461508,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shiro Asano","original_name":"Shiro Asano","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55434c8792514158760017f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2899447,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eijiro Hatta","original_name":"Eijiro Hatta","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdd3217fd4a9600402ca405","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1992214","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13092,"name":"corpse"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1898-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
