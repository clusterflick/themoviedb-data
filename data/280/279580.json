They were struck by the amazing complexity of such a simple place. They set out to tell the story of a city and a riot. But were told the story of a place that is a pure reflection of America. This documentary is more than a view of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot. It is an analysis of social, economic, religious, and human ethics yet investigated. The residents of Tulsa guide you through the evolution, and lack of, of their city. Religious Leaders, an Attorney, a City Councilman, a Community Activist, and an Educator guide you through this seething examination of the socio-economic and racial paradoxes of America.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burn: The Evolution of an American City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Jackson III","original_name":"Harold Jackson III","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9cf72eda4b70080b65811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1571566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
