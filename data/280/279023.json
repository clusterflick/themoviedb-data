The documentary looks at Tokyo's music culture as a reflection of Japanese society and in relation to international music culture. Tokyo's reputation for an overwhelming variety of global information, media-saturated urban environment and cutting edge innovation, makes it the perfect sample for addressing a new outlook on music culture as it explores this eccentric music culture set within a modern Japanese megalopolis.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":"/ut8Q8UVUsPKF55mLPlfU64c0Iwu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live from Tokyo","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606397,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shugo Tokumaru","original_name":"Shugo Tokumaru","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64542fff33ad8f01728e4b87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4045261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Matsue","original_name":"Jennifer Matsue","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6454304fd8f44e0db19fe2a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shintaro Miyazaki","original_name":"Shintaro Miyazaki","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6454306ad48cee0136d99f6b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4045262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinji Masuko","original_name":"Shinji Masuko","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64543083091e6201234fed0e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4045263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saya Ueno","original_name":"Saya Ueno","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"645430c6c044290122cc2c9c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4045264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Ueno","original_name":"Takashi Ueno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"645430ec091e6200e4cdb9a2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3048722,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lewis Rapkin","original_name":"Lewis Rapkin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6454312d33ad8f00fef3d05b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3048722,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lewis Rapkin","original_name":"Lewis Rapkin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6454310e091e6201234fed36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1578594","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":2229,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ut8Q8UVUsPKF55mLPlfU64c0Iwu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
