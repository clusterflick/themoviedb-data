She also works part-time at her mother's side dish shop and still asks for money from her parents. Her personal life isn't in much better shape as she is seeing her best friend's boyfriend (Lee Jae-Yoon). Gyu-Jung then decides to write a novel about a vampire. This is most likely her last shot at writing a successful novel. A strange man named Nam-Gul (Park Jung-Sik) appears and rents a room at her father's lodging home. The strange man stops by the side dish shop at night and requests custom made dishes from Gyu-Jung. He specifies that all of the side dishes must not contain garlic. Gyu-Jung becomes convinced he is a vampire.","popularity":0.4183,"poster_path":"/gbr4FfcWZpNTVWVT1SyabviKU5N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mountain Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2014-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Are My Vampire","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Geudaen Naui Baempaieo","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":547972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choi Yoon-young","original_name":"최윤영","popularity":0.3833,"profile_path":"/2JuT2FEDW3bvvgRYByS4Gh1Zkkj.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Gyu-Jung","credit_id":"53b171cc0e0a26597d008201","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Jung-Sik","original_name":"Park Jung-Sik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nam-Gul","credit_id":"53b171e20e0a26598c008425","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Jae-yoon","original_name":"이재윤","popularity":0.5152,"profile_path":"/pyT8z45N8cme3YaDaZnmIKgyrk4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Police officer","credit_id":"53b171fe0e0a265983008162","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Jong-goo","original_name":"김종구","popularity":0.2485,"profile_path":"/t5CnFB7boQEoNofUmch5wcUn2w3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gyu-Jung's father","credit_id":"53b172320e0a265980008158","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahbub Alam","original_name":"Mahbub Alam","popularity":0.1745,"profile_path":"/nxQiNtST6F26kBI1OJKHtNjpPUE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bahbub","credit_id":"53b1725e0e0a265983008171","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Hyeong-mi","original_name":"Kim Hyeong-mi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Heo Ji-soon","credit_id":"53b177d40e0a26597900818d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jang Young-nam","original_name":"장영남","popularity":1.1017,"profile_path":"/u0hl8WSswFhKVaKwaMAERU0xUJk.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Nam-Gul's mother (cameo)","credit_id":"53c3ba360e0a26158500c372","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1101372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Hee-kyung","original_name":"문희경","popularity":0.4905,"profile_path":"/v3ixMPbPLAIhEPG5BiIJIXhsXjD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hwang Deok-hee","credit_id":"56ae402ec3a3681c5c00a0c4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335937,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kwak Seo-yeon","original_name":"Kwak Seo-yeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53b178820e0a265983008200","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Won-hoi","original_name":"Lee Won-hoi","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/t2HCAwPmZUyjJLarjhVxWvh6s8H.jpg","credit_id":"53b1786c0e0a2659790081a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135848,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Moon In-dae","original_name":"문인대","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e14360b5907de0017e264e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3243664","wikidata_id":"Q18730870","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fQ2dmKz4hUHdHWdN1eFo4LfGdYE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":1462,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/gbr4FfcWZpNTVWVT1SyabviKU5N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1013},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1059,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/xDUKpcyS2NL06zRbBDYYiNXIfWd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":743}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15세 이상 관람가","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"You Are My Vampire (2014) trailer","key":"QYOjr3ZZhos","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-08-13T17:13:54.000Z","id":"5e5843538e2ba60011ec84cc"}]}}}
