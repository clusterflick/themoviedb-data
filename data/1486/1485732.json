The series examines the Gilded Age in the late 19th century, the Progressive Era of the early 20th century, the Roaring Twenties, and the Great Depression. This program explores our history and culture during the early 20th century, when a wave of reforms changed our political system and attempted to remedy the social and economic inequities arising from industrialization and urbanization. Progressive President Theodore Roosevelt helped set the tone of the era by supporting regulation of industry, initiating government reforms, and promoting conservation of public lands. The Progressive Era altered the course of our history in many ways, including the strengthening of labor unions, political and election reforms, and imposition of the first federal income tax on Americans.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just The Facts: Emergence of Modern America - The Progressive Era","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
