But when urban development forces its demolition, a wave of grief sweeps through those who called it home.  Through powerful, intimate moments, this deeply human story explores loss not tied to death, but to place, memory, and identity. Guided by the five stages of grief, director Ota invites us to reflect on what it means to say goodbye not just to a building, but to a vital space of connection, healing, and shared life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Numakage Public Pool","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shingo Ota","original_name":"太田信吾","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682e5ee5e0b70a17b3d5beb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
