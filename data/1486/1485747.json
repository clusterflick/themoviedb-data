This program takes viewers through the famous battles at Shiloh, Antietam, and Gettysburg which pitted brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor.

Lee, who became legends and the nobility of the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, who became a martyr in his noble crusade to end slavery.
