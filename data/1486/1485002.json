When Morgan learns from her Uncle Tommy (Danza) that someone anonymously helped her family get by after he was drafted more than 60 years ago — and that he continues to receive a Christmas gift each year to this day — she decides to find his benefactor and give her uncle a Christmas he’ll always remember. Aided by Bills Mafia friends of theirs, Morgan and Gabe work together to unwrap the gifter’s identity. Along the way, Gabe’s love for Morgan deepens and in turn, she begins to see him in a new light though neither is daring enough to admit their feelings.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53015,"logo_path":"/tWxubAjwO1QtLLWdnUR1bjS1vvf.png","name":"Hallmark Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3232,"logo_path":"/8KtxMsWLOK6zDTNAfi75yg2QvSt.png","name":"NFL Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":173807,"logo_path":"/vXKfbGDlT9bNCio5BXmiWpOp6Vi.png","name":"Skydance Sports","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This heartwarming story celebrates the bonds of family and community with romance and a touch of Christmas magic.","title":"Holiday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":208782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holland Roden","original_name":"Holland Roden","popularity":2.3881,"profile_path":"/vtk55PbPoZskBZtiV96vHqLJUgD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb369ca17c9182649bbc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Daddario","original_name":"Matthew Daddario","popularity":2.1632,"profile_path":"/xaXhIWX4jq69R2CzLmcugQ5u5uS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb40a91b6791f76497d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Danza","original_name":"Tony Danza","popularity":2.6243,"profile_path":"/qoUp1mtEFvrWHG3kEM35coysf5y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb46e4b3f999dfe25810","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Schirripa","original_name":"Steve Schirripa","popularity":3.0194,"profile_path":"/2Nd2Hd4zIBCv4ZoXFhSkrJCx6wB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb4f1e90923045f5693b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":177443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Pollan","original_name":"Tracy Pollan","popularity":2.1652,"profile_path":"/kMsIHlRNlSw9DxKELWPRkm1D6RI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb6184c17c112f8c143d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1847439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patti Murin","original_name":"Patti Murin","popularity":0.5375,"profile_path":"/ivgrvBrK9kY6WqFnOIPFjtUHGTE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb70e1b02296f58c1426","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3739084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Palestina","original_name":"Joey Palestina","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb7c63fc3c228a2f802f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Aaron","original_name":"Caroline Aaron","popularity":2.9927,"profile_path":"/7nnic1Dao3XoScrwX7Ac39N2BC1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"682dfb87050c90eded6498aa","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dustin Rikert","original_name":"Dustin Rikert","popularity":1.4511,"profile_path":"/sTHc9pupAI6noW60AsIz02I8tWn.jpg","credit_id":"682dfb9ca9abf722132f7fc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36604797","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
