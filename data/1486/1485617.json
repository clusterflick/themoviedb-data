Though only in 11th grade, he steps into a world far beyond his years—where life and death decisions are made daily. The film offers an intimate glimpse into the world of youth volunteering, shedding light on the physical and emotional challenges they face. During their shifts, these teens—riding ambulances and saving lives—are exposed to harsh realities no ordinary teenager would typically encounter. And yet, they keep coming back. Not for recognition, but for a higher purpose.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Respond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"איתי כהן: נער הפלא מנצרת עילית","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoav Karinn","original_name":"Yoav Karinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f6278ac617788985ed5a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5455434,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ori Kadosh","original_name":"Ori Kadosh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f6290a155c93eaea8d45a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451031,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Itay Cohen","original_name":"Itay Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f62ebb3379b7d99d5c269","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
