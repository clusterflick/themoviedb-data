We learn how they lived in their foraging societies; what their life may have been like; how they fashioned tools out of stone, wood and bone; and how scientists determine the age of the fossils that give us windows to their world. Moreover, we examine patterns that developed, which give us insight into human adaptation and evolution. These creatures lived millions of years ago, appearing during the Pliocene Epoch. Scientists theorize that a major extinction event, which happened much earlier and wiped out much of life on earth, made it possible for modern humans to evolve. Experts from major universities share their knowledge in this remarkable video that enables us to travel back in time to meet the oldest ancestors of humans.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just The Facts: Prehistoric Man - Human Evolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
