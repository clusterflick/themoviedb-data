Under the threat of an impending evacuation, three of the bay's residents struggle with their loneliness. Eliezer (53), who lives solitarily at the bay, moved to Eilat a few years earlier in an attempt to revive his relationship with his father. Amir (45), a post-traumatic veteran and new resident, attempts to rehabilitate himself and make a new home at the site. Tova (72) is an English immigrant who tries to rearrange her life away from her family and children. Against the human connections they left behind, the three search for a home and stability in their solitude.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7wSmGPkPbwgQSLMgQJOHy6ySqyX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sun Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3581322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ido Weisman","original_name":"Ido Weisman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682e54e9c8bbb0b3a0a8cff5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593885,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ayala Bengad","original_name":"Ayala Bengad","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682e5503627e508a99684462","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3581322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ido Weisman","original_name":"Ido Weisman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682e550f184d4e1e023af51f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36962404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7wSmGPkPbwgQSLMgQJOHy6ySqyX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
