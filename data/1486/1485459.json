After Tommy's girlfriend leaves and the band gets an eviction notice on their apartment door, Tommy needs to find money fast. While Tommy is eating three-day old pizza, a poster of his 1970's hero, the singer of Foreigner, Lou Graham, comes to life and gives him the cheat code to scoring the \"big show in Vegas\". As legends in their own minds, the band sets out on a cross- country road trip with stars in their eyes. The sleezeball trio gets into mischief every step of the way in this comedic hijinks romp.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/zePJCsg3k0KlkKQEOpPY9Z8Ct8H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salad Bar Health Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"I smell cheese","title":"Cheesebait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tucker Rountree","original_name":"Tucker Rountree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tommy D","credit_id":"682f2273778c339068d5c118","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Mayo","original_name":"Joshua Mayo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Stevie","credit_id":"682f227d6edcdfbe893af81c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Fernlund","original_name":"Andrew Fernlund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dirk","credit_id":"682f2286a3f68517723af831","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sela Ellen Underwood","original_name":"Sela Ellen Underwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Darlene","credit_id":"682f22901b674a70491c1f3c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Kohler","original_name":"Nathan Kohler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mikey","credit_id":"682f22986edcdfbe893af82b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby James","original_name":"Bobby James","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"682f22a05db6d2d76e1c1ef0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Hare-Diggs","original_name":"Anna Hare-Diggs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Trixie","credit_id":"682f22a92a5b69a442a8d360","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tucker Rountree","original_name":"Tucker Rountree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f22be1286c89a1168477c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tucker Rountree","original_name":"Tucker Rountree","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f22c30f22ce7f4a343ef3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35929316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1201,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zePJCsg3k0KlkKQEOpPY9Z8Ct8H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":796}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Shown at Brewvies in Salt Lake City","release_date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
