But now, it's a prime location from which illegal boats to Europe depart. Most fishermen want to leave, as there isn't even enough fish left to feed the families.  Modou is thirty and has twice attempted the perilous journey to Europe. Each time, he nearly lost his life but he's determined to try his luck again. And the next generation is ready to follow.  Talla, Modou's cousin is an English teacher who has chosen to stay in Senegal to work for the development of his country. He tries to make his students aware of the dangers of crossing and the importance of staying in Senegal, despite the fact that most of them have lost all hope in the future of the country.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barcelona or Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Idrissa Guiro","original_name":"Idrissa Guiro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f8b09226d8b2e862b60c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
