Many feel their vote doesn t count, but this enlightening video points out why we should take the franchise, our right to vote, very seriously. Also, while reviewing the election process throughout the history of our nation, this video shows how we ve gradually expanded voting rights. There are more Constitutional Amendments dealing with elections and voting than with any other aspect of our government. Over the years Amendments have bestowed this valuable democratic right on more and more citizens. This video also explains the electoral college, and how we actually elect our government officials. It explains concepts and terms like suffrage, disfranchisement, lobbyists and political action committees, and it explores ways in which the election process might be improved, in the wake of the hotly contested Bush-Gore race for the Presidency.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just The Facts: The Election Process In America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
