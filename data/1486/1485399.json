The eleven-story Modernist building on South Michigan Avenue was home to Jet and Ebony magazines since its design in 1971. The building was heralded as the first major downtown Chicago building designed by an African-American architect since the eighteenth century. In the case of the Johnson family and its legacy, Hartt looks to the intersection of the publisherâ€™s ideals and values, the style and aesthetics embodied by the site and the lasting cultural impact of the magazines.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stray Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Hartt","original_name":"David Hartt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f0a10a3f68517723af739","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220933,"name":"fine art"},{"id":244417,"name":"art installation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago","release_date":"2011-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
