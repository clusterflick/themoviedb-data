As burial space dwindles, vast underground tunnels are carved deep into the mountain, designed to hold over 23,000 new Kosher graves. The film moves between the cemetery above and the monumental excavation below, revealing a mosaic of voices: burial society workers, Palestinian tunnel diggers, entrepreneurs, curious visitors, and mourners. As these worlds converge, the film offers a rare glimpse into a culture built around death-practical, ritualistic, and emotional. Necropolis immerses viewers in the tensions between tradition and innovation, war and peace, sacred duty and daily labor-uncovering how, in Jerusalem, death is not merely an end but a powerful force shaping the world of the living.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Necropolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36919936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
