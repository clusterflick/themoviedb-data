It was a man she didn't know, calling to giver her a notebook. Covered in brown paper, its pages hand-sewn together, this was no ordinary notebook. It was one in which her mother, Mina, had hand-written recipes while interned in the Nazi concentration camp at Terezin, in Czechoslovakia.  MINA'S RECIPE BOOK retraces Mina's story, as told by her grandson, a fellow internee, and a trove of archival material. Sent to Terezin along with the rest of Prague's Jews in 1941, she shared a room with 13 other women, only one of whom would survive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mina's Recipe Book","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890856,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Georget","original_name":"Anne Georget","popularity":0.3709,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682f9970f6c8d4483b2b6131","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
