The river is a thread woven in and out of Alex Obregon's life since he was three weeks old. While working as a raft guide in southern Chile, Alex found his love of fly fishing by way of whitewater, and simultaneously deepened his appreciation and understanding of all the spaces and species a river holds.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qJsNVntPgy238UPnamDLuFxosvv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between The Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5456006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz McGregor","original_name":"Liz McGregor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682fa3ca2d616b90cab6a61f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJsNVntPgy238UPnamDLuFxosvv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
