His doctor, Dr. Stackson, becomes frustrated with Art's lack of progress and decides to discontinue all of his prescriptions at once. This catapults Art into a sober world for the first time and down the road of dangerous readjusting. Meanwhile, Dr. Stackson finds himself in his own troubles when his pill partner, Isabella, tightens the screws on their business and her dog, Beans, goes missing with the only thing that links the doctor to his entire operation. Beans trots himself into Art's world and the hunt is on for Art as he must dodge drug dealers, game show hosts, and his own fears before he has a complete nervous breakdown.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7H7aeD0KsZPOQ9Sap07Fk59us2o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158738,"logo_path":null,"name":"BPO Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Beans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Dietels","original_name":"Ben Dietels","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Moe Murder","credit_id":"682e9e5e802900958563f402","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Lintner","original_name":"Ryan Lintner","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Stackson","credit_id":"682e9e709d915e78a7d5bebf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blake O'Donnell","original_name":"Blake O'Donnell","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Art Turner","credit_id":"682e9e7e222ef0bfb26cd5f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Shoberg","original_name":"Carrie Shoberg","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Isabella","credit_id":"682e9ed89d915e78a7d5bec3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blake O'Donnell","original_name":"Blake O'Donnell","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682eabafb488b31bd67ba34a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blake O'Donnell","original_name":"Blake O'Donnell","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682ec00213820ace451c1df6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3643040","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
