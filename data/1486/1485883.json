The sugarcane juice is taken to a tank to strain the liquid. The bagasse is used to feed the furnace that heats the pan where the juice is boiled. The mill grinds the coffee, whose husk is also used as fuel to feed the furnace. Care is taken with the boiling juice to reach the required consistency. The molasses is then obtained, which is beaten, deposited in molds and, after drying, removed and its burrs trimmed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o1U6s3ZdYjcy78Lo5jXfhtTssOg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100338,"logo_path":null,"name":"INCE - Instituto Nacional de Cinema Educativo","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fabricação da Rapadura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humberto Mauro","original_name":"Humberto Mauro","popularity":0.1818,"profile_path":"/lPgeWkbKid3n7xVPCNbQCIfipiY.jpg","credit_id":"682fd2aaedb3e846e54132b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670338,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"José A.
