This question is asked by anyone who wants to make a good movie. What if the tale about Cinderella and the Prince, tale as old as time, will suddenly happen nowadays? Why not? Kids, who are studying at FIGA Film Studio, which exists at \"Karavella\" camp for 44 years, as well as their teachers, thought about it. They thought and created a film in a short period of time, just for 4 months only. There is no falling of Cinderella's boot here, no folden carriages and no mice turning to horses, but there are Internet and orbital satellites. There are also kids and adults who can do brave voluntary actions and childish pranks. As well as friendship which can do real magic.  Based on Vladislav Krapivin's play \"What will happen, if?..\" (Что будет, если?..)","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ulmii8wNaRjdwwE0CEtG4GdLeIe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What will happen, if?..","title":"Ещё одна сказка о Золушке","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Lyskov","original_name":"Anton Lyskov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"682e14f904634a6f512f179c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daria Krapivina","original_name":"Daria Krapivina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"682e1508989cf65c7edb3945","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazim Zalyamov","original_name":"Nazim Zalyamov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"682e151dd06d53d1b39e3ee5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Dedyukhin","original_name":"Alexander Dedyukhin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"682e153ef5a4f4eac80be4c4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larisa Krapivina","original_name":"Larisa Krapivina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"682e154e933e88e062e257f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larisa Tkacheva","original_name":"Larisa Tkacheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"682e157a84c17c112f8c14b8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Vorobyov","original_name":"Nikita Vorobyov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"682e158c7c8c04687e649a32","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Belostotsky","original_name":"Ilya Belostotsky","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bj0IrJzXpE7YvfjfOKt7UmZ3TQj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"682e15b57f67ac825a2f16a7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Belostotsky","original_name":"Ilya Belostotsky","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bj0IrJzXpE7YvfjfOKt7UmZ3TQj.jpg","credit_id":"682e16103c007aa7039e426e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larisa Krapivina","original_name":"Larisa Krapivina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682e165080692bab55649a17","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Belostotsky","original_name":"Ilya Belostotsky","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bj0IrJzXpE7YvfjfOKt7UmZ3TQj.jpg","credit_id":"682e165df5cbf1d861e2575e","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9481698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ulmii8wNaRjdwwE0CEtG4GdLeIe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7VnHSJIIzUs9C5CQkhx0s6x3c6O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3071,"name":"prince"},{"id":10181,"name":"based on play or musical"},{"id":11616,"name":"vhs"},{"id":13424,"name":"tv reporter"},{"id":164246,"name":"nostalgic"},{"id":197349,"name":"children's story"},{"id":274830,"name":"fictional kingdom"},{"id":279822,"name":"minimalist"},{"id":281237,"name":"independent film"},{"id":284950,"name":"cinderella"},{"id":299518,"name":"vhs release"},{"id":323091,"name":"cinderella story"},{"id":325784,"name":"comforting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
