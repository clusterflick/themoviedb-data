It's just one of many telling moments in BUSINESS CLUB that speak to the observational powers of filmmakers Chloe Mahieu and Lila Pinell.  BUSINESS CLUB is a brilliant portrait of de Soultrait and the world he lives in. He is an aristocrat who plays up his family's links to royalty for Chinese and American investors, a somewhat hapless businessman who doesn't seem to understand the basics of branding, and a multimillionaire who bobs his head to hip-hop while driving - in a moment reminiscent of the opening scene in Office Space.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Business Club","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
