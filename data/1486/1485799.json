He served in the White House in the midst of a national crisis. Though ill prepared for the trauma of a civil war, he adapted himself to the circumstances to become an extraordinary leader. A flexible man of thought and a master of words, he is best known for signing the Emancipation Proclamation and writing the Gettysburg Address. For all his deeds and efforts in freeing the slaves and preserving the Union, Abraham Lincoln became the heroic martyr of the Civil War.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just the Facts: American Presidents: Abraham Lincoln","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
