The enormous, geometric depressions had attracted international attention, and the size and complexity of the overnight formations had led to increasing animosity and debate between serious “Researchers” and self-proclaimed “Hoaxers”, with local farmers and villagers caught in the middle of the annual spectacle. CircleSpeak tells the story of the people at the center – and on both sides – of the crop circle debate during the season of 2001. The documentary was hailed as an intelligent and nuanced look at the passions and beliefs of those who were immersed, and sometimes obsessed, with the strange and compelling field glyphs. Interviews are balanced with behind-the-scenes footage of the daily race to discover, investigate, or perhaps even create the next amazing crop circle.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/u1nJiyhihAZoGPteabRmmOXkCS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263016,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Land Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey Into the Heart Of Crop Circle Country","title":"CircleSpeak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sorensen","original_name":"Peter Sorensen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2c24df31bc3909f56965","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Andrews","original_name":"Colin Andrews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2d5fe19cab56120be2e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Pringle","original_name":"Lucy Pringle","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2d77f7e538f8302f81ba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Busty Taylor","original_name":"Busty Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2d9be1b02296f58c1484","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Mallett","original_name":"Frances Mallett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2de3ef6883779bf56be6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Mallett","original_name":"Charles Mallett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2df3eb593065a02f16b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Carson","original_name":"Polly Carson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2e1e9ca17c9182649c52","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Kingston","original_name":"Isabelle Kingston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2e32a788f78d8864987c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Bower","original_name":"Doug Bower","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2e54050c90eded649971","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Lundberg","original_name":"John Lundberg","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2e70eaeb5360bcdb36da","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Alexander","original_name":"Steve Alexander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2ed7a788f78d8864988b","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Douglas","original_name":"Karen Douglas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2f040fae87163af567cf","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Thomas","original_name":"Andy Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2f8a3c007aa7039e42bc","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Sherwood","original_name":"Ed Sherwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e2f9800d1cec6c1db3718","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":81595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kris Sherwood","original_name":"Kris Sherwood","popularity":1.037,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"self","credit_id":"682e329600d1cec6c1db372d","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5453520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.C.
