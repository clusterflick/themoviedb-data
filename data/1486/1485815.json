Northern moderates and radicals alike agreed that for the war to be declared a victory, three points had to be achieved: the Confederacy had to be truly dead, slavery had to be truly dead, and the possibility of either being revived had to be eliminated. How to achieve these three goals and who would decide when they were achieved, caused great controversy. This program presents each side of the controversy and how the goals to achieve reconstruction were outlines and achieved.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just the Facts: U.S. History : Reconstruction of the United States","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
