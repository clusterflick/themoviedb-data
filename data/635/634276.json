Raymond Bellour has written of Kuntzel's achievement in \"representing the unrepresentable: the spatial or temporal in-between created by the disjunction/conjunction between mental representation and perception, surface and depth... past and present, conscious and unconscious. As the hero — the author and original spectator — establishes his presence, crossing the room in both frames at once, we are given the outline of what representation holds out to fiction: the hero's gaze into the window, where he can see his life slipping past, inside and outside.\"","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/iPWFJhXrQqfMqcAqV5RPgooeCgC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Smoking a Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Kuntzel","original_name":"Thierry Kuntzel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8c59b2d9f4a6001852776f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0183896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1028,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iPWFJhXrQqfMqcAqV5RPgooeCgC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":688}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
