Where am I?' The man who wakes up alone in the woods has many questions. Is he dead and in the hereafter? The voice of God soberly answers his questions: Yep, that’s right. Traffic accident. But it’s not that bad, because everyone eventually dies. All the man’s questions, also about the meaning of life, are answered. In an equally entertaining and stimulating dialogue in English, the film evokes a comprehensive image of the universe and man’s place in it.","popularity":0.4382,"poster_path":"/gR4ExuzQyzO03cSUSl2y207EhGh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123439,"logo_path":"/bykSb5Gv8j95QOXAqr4IBKHPePZ.png","name":"Studio Ruba","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":61303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Venfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Re \\ Entry","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Re - Entry","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Issaka Sawadogo","original_name":"Issaka Sawadogo","popularity":0.3876,"profile_path":"/kwEZzrGHsv2Jr2cL9VBQsfDM1Gb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Man","credit_id":"5d8d097c23168c0020b92ab7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2419172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bang Reilly","original_name":"John Bang Reilly","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"God","credit_id":"5d8d098523168c0028b92c9a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2035479,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maxime Desmet","original_name":"Maxime Desmet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61223577d4b9d9007c529b06","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Brand","original_name":"Ben Brand","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8d0938172d7f0027513813","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352085,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andy Weir","original_name":"Andy Weir","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/e5QyrLpEBwE6qhPERT9aDvRF66x.jpg","credit_id":"603762e1eec5b5003d1c8b77","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Brand","original_name":"Ben Brand","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60376303e62719003f296b13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315069,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Schonewille","original_name":"Patrick Schonewille","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037634e11c066003d48d099","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990207,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Moniek Sterk","original_name":"Moniek Sterk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037638d4fd141003daecb12","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262511,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maarten van der Ven","original_name":"Maarten van der Ven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037639bd132d60041a3a306","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2035479,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maxime Desmet","original_name":"Maxime Desmet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67901d1ba7b4d981f33a526d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11152684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/axLNd2MmTzYbTNSMRVPkkNFcJYc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1C62LEYlVX7Bx55aNI1wFnKtWWK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":840,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/gR4ExuzQyzO03cSUSl2y207EhGh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
