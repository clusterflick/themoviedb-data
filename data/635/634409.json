Each character, from a porcine union-jack doting politician to a phone-addicted white cat, stand in as an archetype in the UKâ€™s political landscape as it considers its exit from the European Union. Set apart on independent monitors, these anthropomorphized incarnations menace one another through tacit acts of ridicule in a perpetually cycling theatre, falling between farcical and cruel. Maclean points us to the mechanisms of belonging and nativeness at play in the performance of national identity.","popularity":0.0871,"poster_path":"/qtr4y88QS6kjF5xgsiTPWTi5ep6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Native Animals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Maclean","original_name":"Rachel Maclean","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/6JxIplkoJ73UT4kQHjKVUxZgfnh.jpg","credit_id":"5d8d1184d9f4a6002853a79a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iDthlPskAhyTqRDxBMEtCZY4k7k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qtr4y88QS6kjF5xgsiTPWTi5ep6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
