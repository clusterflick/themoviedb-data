Since its premiere alongside The Great Blondino and other shorts in April 1967, the film has rarely been seen. It stands out as a more textural piece from Nelson, which, rather than retreating into pure abstraction or bland trippiness, subtly transmits an undercurrent of its ominous source material. â€”Mark Toscano.
