His bountiful and socio-culturally evocative work in music and theatre was central to the Black Arts Movement of the 1970s; integral to the evolution of hip hop, from its inception through its golden era of consciousness and heavy jazz-laden sampling; and whose dedicated mentorship sparked a movement in his long-time residence of Jamaica/St. Albans, Queens, helping develop some of the most well-known figures in jazz today.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Digging for Weldon Irvine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352351,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victorious DeCosta","original_name":"Victorious DeCosta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8de634109cd000213ffbaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2419693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angelika Beener","original_name":"Angelika Beener","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8de64a8289a0000fcb9c74","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352351,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victorious DeCosta","original_name":"Victorious DeCosta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8de641221ba60019b4e027","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796700,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Mike Quigley","original_name":"Mike Quigley","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8de654172d7f000d538791","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7289808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Doc'n Roll Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
