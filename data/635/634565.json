Featuring extensive, incisive interviews with family members, academics, directors and actors, including Shivaun O'Casey, Prof Charles Barr, and Peter Sheridan, it tells the story of how these two iconic figures met and the legacy of the film.","popularity":0.2416,"poster_path":"/cSa8BOEX0j462e0fJsrA0KaZxPw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bruno
