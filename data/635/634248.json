The letters, encompassing the decades from the 50s to the 70s, refer to love and idealism, record world travels, talk about socialism and psychoanalysis, about pain and broken dreams. Their reading reveals a relationship between the actors, with similarities and differences. Meanwhile, with his own daughter, the director sets about solving the puzzle of the family memory, an intimate twentieth-century tale.","popularity":0.112,"poster_path":"/3h6DuHthBOCR873HVEZVMkpz0PU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46212,"logo_path":"/8NNQcHc8dx2uYW3ehi5ebHmJZOe.png","name":"Gema Films","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private Fiction","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1294762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Groesman","original_name":"Denise Groesman","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/aPZlNy9uyqs5iWjfB02euOpBt3W.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d90f088109cd00029455cc4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julián Larquier Tellarini","original_name":"Julián Larquier Tellarini","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/1fWqLU4U0BHendob3SGMV4xYs33.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d90f09500508a00299ce275","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Di Tella","original_name":"Lola Di Tella","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d90f0b1172d7f000d58a2ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","original_name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ohvnmqBj5DyXvj4uD3veAqF0yDS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0432068a0e9b003499b569","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1746307,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alejandra Grinschpun","original_name":"Alejandra Grinschpun","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e05403cb5c8e00670c71f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725357,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gema Juárez Allen","original_name":"Gema Juárez Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e053f4cb30840098d83e68","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Renau","original_name":"Juan Renau","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/2BCoVTiJVb0VYUsbmUteD0hSpiX.jpg","credit_id":"61e0542fbf0f63009a13941f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2713502,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sami Buccella","original_name":"Sami Buccella","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/vvcHHwiEMDjY4smlDTt0My1YNbw.jpg","credit_id":"65a5c7749bcd0f0126ba34bd","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Di Tella","original_name":"Andrés Di Tella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/roLKzSYB2kmZIUJOqdA3Ny2S5QH.jpg","credit_id":"5d90f0c3172d7f002757deb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Di Tella","original_name":"Andrés Di Tella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/roLKzSYB2kmZIUJOqdA3Ny2S5QH.jpg","credit_id":"5d90f0c9ec18790020d61412","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931701,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valeria Racioppi","original_name":"Valeria Racioppi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d90f0e000508a00219ce077","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10591492","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xc7rsRkspYFhwZm4o4cYiKmY1eN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3h6DuHthBOCR873HVEZVMkpz0PU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CINE.AR TV","release_date":"2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CINE.AR Play","release_date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Sebastián International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
