Working primarily in cedar, von Rydingsvard creates monumental sculptures that play with texture and shape in ways that evoke surprising emotion. Born in Germany to Ukrainian-Polish parents, von Rydingsvardâ€™s family was detained for five years in a post-WWII refugee camp before moving to America. The pain and trauma of this experience, coupled with the anger born from an abusive childhood, left indelible marks on Ursula. But her ability to channel this into her work and practice undoubtedly birthed an artist of singular determination and talent.","popularity":1.7923,"poster_path":"/6lArPtMRBhnrYTqg32kiS8oiA8U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ursula von Rydingsvard: Into Her Own","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2420800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula von Rydingsvard","original_name":"Ursula von Rydingsvard","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cp2t64HVXVCVkIAIXO4ba3ED3qK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d8fbb0579b3d400278d126d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Traub","original_name":"Daniel Traub","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m87DsUamv6KYuFZKPsdt8twwwKA.jpg","credit_id":"6195de3fa0f1a2006101ae22","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Traub","original_name":"Daniel Traub","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m87DsUamv6KYuFZKPsdt8twwwKA.jpg","credit_id":"5d8fbb2179b3d400278d1286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Kobland","original_name":"Ken Kobland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73bc9691b530003a8a5684","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467931,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon TaufiQue","original_name":"Simon TaufiQue","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73bca2ef48890039f86c5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Traub","original_name":"Daniel Traub","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m87DsUamv6KYuFZKPsdt8twwwKA.jpg","credit_id":"5f73bcb2d388ae0037bc720b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467931,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon TaufiQue","original_name":"Simon TaufiQue","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73bcbdef48890036fe6c29","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Kobland","original_name":"Ken Kobland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73bcd8fea0d70033ffd5fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6406,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melody London","original_name":"Melody London","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73bce41967570039915279","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7578912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aCiPTKwvWnBJIORnhb9CRlRDrqs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6lArPtMRBhnrYTqg32kiS8oiA8U.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1060,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e1VVjGst5BrJKdOwzvRQCZsiD42.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"URSULA VON RYDINGSVARD: INTO HER OWN Trailer","key":"2p7MlhEtMvY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-05-07T21:45:43.000Z","id":"645374c9d48cee0119a11831"}]}}}
