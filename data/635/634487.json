I was struck by the redemptive critical and visionary character of his work which struck me as similar to G.M. Hopkins or Clarence Smith. Coincidentally as I was shooting these films I went to a screening of Charles Burnett and asked him what film he would like to make but couldn't get the money for. He replied, \"a feature narrative about Tyree Suyton.\"  So I put together four of the films from Spring 2000 into a four-film work called \"4 For Charles Burnett - All That's Solid Melts Into Air\". They are: ALL THAT'S SOLID, LIGHT LICK, TOSCANINI'S EUROPEAN SIDEWALK CAFE, and MELTS INTO AIR.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/m6r8j5goMDt417lLXILScnr8bF1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All That's Solid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saul Levine","original_name":"Saul Levine","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lfLF8BWO3fkpx2P0971gGT156x2.jpg","credit_id":"5d8d6b8d8289a00029ca9fe5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m6r8j5goMDt417lLXILScnr8bF1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
