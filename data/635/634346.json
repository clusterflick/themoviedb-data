In the 3,000 square foot basement of his East Hampton home, Scully reconstructed his idyllic 1950s childhood in the form of one of the world's largest model train sets. From the train tickets, to the dining car menus, to the stores lining the track, his 1:32 scale models have everything down to the last detail. Together the train sets retell the history of railroads in the United States, from coal-fired steam engines to diesel.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Plays With Trains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9640246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
