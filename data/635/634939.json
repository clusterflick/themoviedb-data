They contacted a young university troubadour, Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio, and on return to Stockholm set about making an album with the recording of his songs. They called it Canciones de la Resistencia española and kept the singer-songwriter's identity anonymous. The album was an instant hit all over Scandinavia.","popularity":0.0564,"poster_path":"/nuqlyNakNtcBlF2WO1NzPVVifHl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buenavida Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Si me borrara el viento lo que yo canto","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457956,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio","original_name":"Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8f876279b3d400278cd142","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420683,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julio César Tortuero","original_name":"Julio César Tortuero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8f8787172d7f002755c6fd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420684,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Noemí de la Peña","original_name":"Noemí de la Peña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8f87a3172d7f00175626e4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":985474,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marta Velasco","original_name":"Marta Velasco","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d91033e00508a00119cecac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59879,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Trueba","original_name":"David Trueba","popularity":0.241,"profile_path":"/76KoMGIBuQWMmxOI8Nsz9fQZ4tI.jpg","credit_id":"5db8222d0792e10018449d93","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59879,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Trueba","original_name":"David Trueba","popularity":0.241,"profile_path":"/76KoMGIBuQWMmxOI8Nsz9fQZ4tI.jpg","credit_id":"5db821bc2d37210013e95dec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11198108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/nuqlyNakNtcBlF2WO1NzPVVifHl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1098,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/zqSzc3OfCFeUCyVlSQ9tIlXml2z.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":732},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/9HFtG30dSWvAqGDTa3SeXpNXjrL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/50oXTrA4QQwZgRUhJm7wU66Ry0d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Sebastián International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"APTA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
