We wont persuade you that the movie is objective in the usual sense. But we see its value in something else - the fact that we have been an active part of the events and that we were effectively shaping them. The movie of the Antifascist Action (AFA) monitors more than twenty years of the struggle against neo-Nazis, fascists and racists. The historic cross-section shows the multiple rises and falls of neo-Nazis and racists. You will witness the power as well as limited potential of the antifascist movement that doesnt deal just with neo-Nazis, but also with the repression of the state and the public opinion.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"161>88","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2323758","wikidata_id":"Q104896414","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
