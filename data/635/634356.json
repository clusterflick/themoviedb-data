Along the way, she connects with a cultural legacy that she has never really known about and learns about her own Ulster-Scots heritage.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/cbICQYGcfuQzxHf3gHhM9zG8ACR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erica Starling Productions","origin_country":"XI"},{"id":11667,"logo_path":"/dhBJdstAolGmqRfbQfElhsU1cTo.png","name":"Northern Ireland Screen","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Carryin' Stream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alison Millar","original_name":"Alison Millar","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d8ce092d9f4a60028536993","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alison Millar","original_name":"Alison Millar","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8ce058d9f4a60018533299","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cbICQYGcfuQzxHf3gHhM9zG8ACR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
