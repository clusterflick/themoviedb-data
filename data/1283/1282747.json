Our trans and queer ancestors have experienced both love and hate, sometimes at the same time.  I’m continuously crying over my ancestors, friends, lovers, partners and parents who died way to early.  I remember them all.  May their memories be a revolution.  Zafira Vrba Woodski plays a weeper in the film, crying tears of hormone gel. The testosterone gel was gifted from a friend who died in 2020. The estrogen gel is Zafira’s own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/VeRxJOCu478V2nzv0O19xnfaJ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm continuously crying tears of estrogen and tears of testosterone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zafira Vrba Woodski","original_name":"Zafira Vrba Woodski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66312e5190cf5101266d8919","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1070,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/VeRxJOCu478V2nzv0O19xnfaJ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
