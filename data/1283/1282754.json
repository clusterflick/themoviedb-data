They make music for the tranquillity of the souls of survivors of sexual violence: requiems for the living, the living dead and the dead. In This Moment I'm Living is a wider project that uses sound to surface how trauma changes the way survivors listen. In restructuring sounds and engaging in a process of healing, Thefuries hopes that the listener can experience the work with moments of ease and see the strength of vulnerability. In This Moment, Iâ€™m Living: Ease is a spell blurring the human with the non-human, calling an end to sexual violence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In This Moment, I'm Living: Ease","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiu Makkonen","original_name":"Tiu Makkonen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66312faba843c10123a76383","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
