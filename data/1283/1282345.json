During the penultimate program broadcast on March 25, 1991, the young filmmaker presented Terra Des Hommes as his closing film. Shot in Tibet, the short introduces us to a community that lives among Yaks, large ruminant mammals.  Chantal Jolis, a judge of the competition, said of the film: \"What I felt there was a farewell to something essential, at the same time as a testament to the race.\" Villeneuve ulitmately won that year's edition of La Course Destination Monde.  Notably, the film features the track \"Trip to Arrakis\" by TOTO, composed for David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert's DUNE. Villeneuve would later go on to helm his own adaptation of the novel and it's sequel, DUNE Messiah.","popularity":0.2895,"poster_path":"/qhveaR0G3bU5m7E8u2WfxD8Hd3b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio Canada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Men","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Villeneuve","original_name":"Denis Villeneuve","popularity":3.057,"profile_path":"/zdDx9Xs93UIrJFWYApYR28J8M6b.jpg","credit_id":"66303ad164de350123b266ee","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Villeneuve","original_name":"Denis Villeneuve","popularity":3.057,"profile_path":"/zdDx9Xs93UIrJFWYApYR28J8M6b.jpg","credit_id":"663041295e14e501294bb4fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Villeneuve","original_name":"Denis Villeneuve","popularity":3.057,"profile_path":"/zdDx9Xs93UIrJFWYApYR28J8M6b.jpg","credit_id":"66303aca84591c0125c6a290","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Newton Howard","original_name":"James Newton Howard","popularity":0.9427,"profile_path":"/qB4JgzCXCjr7NwW7UNrgBrWZDlo.jpg","credit_id":"67991de370992b63c3237cd9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Paich","original_name":"David Paich","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/wTAvVmLRfhUmzO3TJAkuC9uLfKq.jpg","credit_id":"67991dec0e1e0486d62b84da","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1049,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6lZ8Cy0jgn9PrQxN77FmouZHwx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1866}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhveaR0G3bU5m7E8u2WfxD8Hd3b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1991-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Denis Villeneuve's - \"Terre des Hommes\" Short Film","key":"w0V5edtnh3A","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-18T16:45:01.000Z","id":"66303c154dc34a012b65640c"}]}}}
