She escapes from captivity and falls in love with Gil, a drug dealer traveling to swap drugs for plutonium. She follows him, afraid to approach. She is followed by Badfly, who pushes women off of ledges, convinced that they can fly; he unsuccessfully tries to kill her, then falls for her. Gil is also followed by Priest, a demonic Catholic father with a penchant for pain. The whole sordid tale is narrated by Half Spirit as she writes the tale on her naked body as she lies dying in a hospital.","popularity":0.1562,"poster_path":"/y1UKdCtUgDgKVyCxLsSherowAED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half Spirit: Voice of the Spider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Half Spirit: Voice of the Spider","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4780611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Ussel","original_name":"Catherine Ussel","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Half Spirit","credit_id":"667098cabfda17a320cf73c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1952550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Spiteri","original_name":"Philippe Spiteri","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/eC1PG8TM219conWTSJivSWycZSf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Badfly","credit_id":"667098e3eac937afc6cf73dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Duret","original_name":"Marc Duret","popularity":0.2992,"profile_path":"/jOLK1qN6z3P1dnxYPrYxe0OV0CE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gil","credit_id":"667098b64c68635068d1e6db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Fontan","original_name":"Jacques Fontan","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"667098dbbbb11d33c9c359d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4780640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Szafirko","original_name":"Gilles Szafirko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Voice of Jimminy","credit_id":"66709c21f182e419dbd1e9fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4780609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Le Dantec","original_name":"Laurence Le Dantec","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"la banquière","credit_id":"667098bffa71cd58ad53a143","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1868590,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carl Beyer","original_name":"Carl Beyer","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6670990feac937afc6cf73e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1626118,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Serge Godet","original_name":"Serge Godet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667099244778fca7b8cf74b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Barges","original_name":"Henri Barges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667098f75aef8bdc95cf7389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Cotte","original_name":"Olivier Cotte","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6670994dff20f0511550badf","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Barges","original_name":"Henri Barges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66709c6f447b711e0bcf741e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Barges","original_name":"Henri Barges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66709c601875605ee2430809","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Barges","original_name":"Henri Barges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66709c491875605ee2430806","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":809,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y1UKdCtUgDgKVyCxLsSherowAED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYJevVu3Mj9NU0zhWZXY3fSNH5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
