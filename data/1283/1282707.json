Mi55SH3LL is obsessed with queer liberation informed by new technologies, digital systems and the internet. She is motivated by the idea that the cyberspace is another space for us to exist in and what the implications would be for queer identities. Mi55SH3LL is inspired by how these could be used as generative tools in creating work that is concerned with queer futures. The story is stitched together using found sound from science fiction movies to video games.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GYN01D","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Fisher","original_name":"Michelle Fisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663121aa62e86f0129525315","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
