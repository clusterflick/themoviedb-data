The events of the incident were located in the Greenville mines from South Carolina. Miners were reported missing for unknown reasons and when an investigation was finally taking place, they caught the anomaly on video. Their first instinct was to send more people down to learn about this creature but it only resulted in more deaths. Finally, a researcher proposed an idea to send down a small undetectable drone which would be able to find all deceased employees and study the White Face. The tape in which the drone took has been recovered and will be shown to the public for the first time.
