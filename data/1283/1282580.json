This piece specifically looks at my current city of residence, Boston's Pride Parade. Pride was a revolution that started June 28, 1970. Now that queers (mostly white, cis, gay) have become widely accepted into the mainstream, they have become a marketable demographic. The marching for liberation has now become a march of brands and banks. These institutions make money off of queer people while still exploiting other marginalized groups. (e.g. TD bank and the funding of the Dakota Access Pipeline) As a queer person or ally, what does it mean now to be waving a rainbow flag with Wells Fargo or TD bank on it?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pride TM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3074597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hogan Seidel","original_name":"Hogan Seidel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6630d495b5bc21012c53a599","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31065201","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
