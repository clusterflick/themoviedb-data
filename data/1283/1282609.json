In collaboration with GMAC, the Glasgow Media Access Centre, LIPS members took on almost every role – as scriptwriters, editors, actors, directors and cinematographers. The films they produced are mostly light-hearted depictions of lesbian and bisexual teenage life – coming out, school, crushes, safe sex. They capture a specific moment in Glasgow’s queer history, where the shadow of the AIDS crisis and tentative openness of a new post-Section 28 era merge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dykes in the City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesbians In Peer Support (L.I.P.S.)","original_name":"Lesbians In Peer Support (L.I.P.S.)","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6630ddc1706e560126022631","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
