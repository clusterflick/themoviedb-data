This documentary would not have been possible without Director of Photography Anatoli Taldykin, Associate Producer Sergio Love, Executive Producer Matt Bongiovi, Music Supervisor Dave Curtin, Editor Sheila Moreland, and Co-Director Anthony Michaels. Thank you so much you guys for making this happen.  Yes, that’s Fred Durst singing backgrounds to “Looking for My Yoko” in the opening, and of course our buddy Bobby Lee is in there doing what Bobby Lee does. Some of the other people that pop up are Laurence Fishburne and many more surprises. This was produced in the late 90s/early 2000s. Some of the locations we visited were New York City, Cannes Film Festival, Des Moines, IA — well just watch it, I’m all over the place bro! I’m all over the place spoogin’!
