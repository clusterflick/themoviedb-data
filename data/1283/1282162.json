His widely publicized trial took place in 2004. Dutroux was convicted of all charges, along with the murder of a suspected former accomplice, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Dutroux's accomplices included Michelle Martin, Michel Lelièvre, Jean-Michel Nihoul, and Bernard Weinstein. Martin was convicted and sentenced as an accomplice to 30 years in prison, while Lelièvre was sentenced to 25 years. Nihoul, a Brussels conman, pub-owner and familiar face at sex parties, was initially tried as an accomplice to the kidnappings, but was acquitted of these charges due to insufficient evidence. He was instead convicted of involvement in a gang that participated in human and drug trafficking and was sentenced to five years in prison. Weinstein was never tried, as he was murdered by Dutroux.","popularity":0.065,"poster_path":"/1W3APh3ORqTnOLCIbbiLIro8fR9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belgium's X-Files - Marc Dutroux","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248155,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olenka Frenkiel","original_name":"Olenka Frenkiel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self/Reporter","credit_id":"662fd417a806730122e96f7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1928872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Dutroux","original_name":"Marc Dutroux","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/acZVy0SxCnpizWrOEgp1xJ41qh8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"662fd44666751d0121841a17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regina Louf","original_name":"Regina Louf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"662fd456f6fd18012b235983","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682918,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Maxwell","original_name":"Alex Maxwell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd4b28a88b20124cee2fb","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682928,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter George","original_name":"Peter George","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd5d435811d0128e8d352","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682923,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fiona Murch","original_name":"Fiona Murch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd593713ea601226956c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957889,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Michael Simkin","original_name":"Michael Simkin","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd508511d090121c5a5b1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":572041,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Finch","original_name":"Simon Finch","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd52c511d09012ac59f2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682916,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Dodd","original_name":"Nick Dodd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd488d96c3c0128991cdd","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682917,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandra Kalkofen","original_name":"Alexandra Kalkofen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd4a18a88b20124cee2f0","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957889,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Michael Simkin","original_name":"Michael Simkin","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd4ed03bf840122eb498b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4534094,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jaspal Banga","original_name":"Jaspal Banga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd57a51c01f012a59ec4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682924,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jane Willey","original_name":"Jane Willey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd5a87d5db5012c3eae91","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682930,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Miller","original_name":"James Miller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fd5e3028f140128696e0d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27766156","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1076,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1W3APh3ORqTnOLCIbbiLIro8fR9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":716}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
