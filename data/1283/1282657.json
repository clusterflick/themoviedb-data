The words read aloud are careful and precious, evoking the woman's recent death and her friendship with the author.  Then images from the past emerge, with the smooth, fragile texture of old video tapes, taking us back to yesterday and the past - the Moscow of twenty years ago - to a world that seems more irrevocably lost than ever .","popularity":0.0952,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":227722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Liberté","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nina","title":"Adieu la rue des radiateurs – Nina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Léon","original_name":"Pierre Léon","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/vJjWWu9Vf8jaTPcOFoyUbrLU2aB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66310122d7a70a0123d91a8c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Léon","original_name":"Vladimir Léon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6631012c4a4bfc012ce13748","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1905039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Riboulet","original_name":"Mathieu Riboulet","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/AqV37RedE78m5cXRlwnt79S7hEp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6631014c9f51af012299b4d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2982444,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lionel Quantin","original_name":"Lionel Quantin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66324eff9590e30129ba445d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4687258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Kotchetkova","original_name":"Nina Kotchetkova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"663267b966565a0126134bdf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Léon","original_name":"Vladimir Léon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663101f7b5bc21012a53b187","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2982444,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lionel Quantin","original_name":"Lionel Quantin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324cdbad59b5012b6cbc4b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Pasquier","original_name":"Arnold Pasquier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324ca7af4324012553aeb8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1905039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Riboulet","original_name":"Mathieu Riboulet","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/AqV37RedE78m5cXRlwnt79S7hEp.jpg","credit_id":"66324c26813cb601248668c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":890990,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sébastien Buchmann","original_name":"Sébastien Buchmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pLXck46WncEeWZ9KxnUZcgVFNKy.jpg","credit_id":"66324cff2a09bc0129583e43","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Léon","original_name":"Pierre Léon","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/vJjWWu9Vf8jaTPcOFoyUbrLU2aB.jpg","credit_id":"66324cbd6611b4012465e824","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940250,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rosalie Revoyre","original_name":"Rosalie Revoyre","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324d53813cb60121866ea2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Léon","original_name":"Vladimir Léon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324d379590e30123ba3cf7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549018,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Mnémosyne","original_name":"Marc Mnémosyne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324d782a09bc012c583d19","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1526320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
