Challenged to craft a monumental art installation within a mere two weeks at the University of Southern Indiana's Pace McCutchan Gallery, Titzer's race against time becomes an intriguing narrative. Filmmaker Jordan Barclay captures Titzer's quest as he returns to his hometown of Evansville, Indiana. Watch as he navigates the local landscape, delving into hoarders' trash, scouring dumpsters, and exploring flea markets to unearth materials that assemble into a room-sized, interactive installation. The end result is a unique creation, inviting tactile exploration and thoughtful examination.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sack Race with Knives: The Curious Art of Kevin Titzer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Titzer","original_name":"Kevin Titzer","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"66314b2da843c10123a7699d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Sickels","original_name":"Chris Sickels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"66314b369a3c490120f9aaa9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenny Dowhie","original_name":"Lenny Dowhie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"66314b427aecc6012772b82a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Dowhie","original_name":"Anne Dowhie","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Interviewee / moderator","credit_id":"66314b4c5a5ed0012943f47f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Waters","original_name":"Katie Waters","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"66314b589a8a8a0124ae0c2b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bouseman","original_name":"Paul Bouseman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"66314b617aecc6012772b836","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Baldwin","original_name":"Sara Baldwin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Moderator","credit_id":"66314b6e60620a012025f837","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3586169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen McGovern","original_name":"Colleen McGovern","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Moderator","credit_id":"66314b9daafebd01205362e7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Barclay","original_name":"Jordan Barclay","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66314bbab234b90124e5c39d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Barclay","original_name":"Jordan Barclay","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66314bab48333a012191c099","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Barclay","original_name":"Jordan Barclay","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66314bb262e86f0127525c86","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4685308,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Bernardin","original_name":"Thomas Bernardin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66314bc81fa1c801229e5583","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
