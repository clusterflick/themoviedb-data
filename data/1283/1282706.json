In the 1980s, residents were promised the Olympics would support economic and residential redevelopment. The program uses footage from various news reports and contemporary interviews to portray the often conflicting interests of the people wanting to see positive community development that could occur as a result of the Olympic Games being held in Atlanta. The program covers the history of Atlanta leading up to hosting the Olympics, development and construction plans, support for and opposition to the Olympic Games in Atlanta, issues surrounding Centennial Olympic Park, and neighborhood development.","popularity":0.2208,"poster_path":"/r7mpNmO33GFREoXr32PRhFcQrEC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georgia Public Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fences & Neighborhoods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Torda","original_name":"Roger Torda","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663121b19369a20121f42c4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Torda","original_name":"Roger Torda","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6631219360620a012325ee8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Torda","original_name":"Roger Torda","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663121a34c2592012ac8f7de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r7mpNmO33GFREoXr32PRhFcQrEC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2076,"name":"atlanta"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
