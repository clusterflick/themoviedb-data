The music is a blend of cultural sensibilities, modern and ancient motifs, electronic and acoustic instrumentation. The dances are a synthesis of traditional Middle Eastern with a contemporary interpretation, symbolic and at times sensual. The production mixes these performances against the dramatic backdrop of Egypt's archaeological treasures creating an expansive cinematic interpretation. The result is a meditation on the eternal mystery of the legendary Sphinx that leads us from the old world to a future one. The shifting sands of time may obscure its path, yet we are still drawn to its compelling destiny.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":227539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media -M- Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trail of the Sphinx","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4683359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anahid Sofian","original_name":"Anahid Sofian","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"6630119e1fd36f012657ce7c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Mannetta","original_name":"Michael Mannetta","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/z7Wf1G0gCCd5vCeZjnl2bOk31KI.jpg","credit_id":"663011b918b75101241227b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Mannetta","original_name":"Michael Mannetta","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/z7Wf1G0gCCd5vCeZjnl2bOk31KI.jpg","credit_id":"663011c12cde9801269fcb0c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4683362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefan Tischler","original_name":"Stefan Tischler","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663011ca1fd36f012657ce89","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4683363,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Keeler Walsh","original_name":"Keith Keeler Walsh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663011d831d09b012b64228f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
