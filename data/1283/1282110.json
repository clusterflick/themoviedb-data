In the village, he was invited to stay at an old fisherman Pak Yem's house. Pak Yem has been living alone for a long time. On a fishing trip, Ali picks a few oysters from the sea and discovers that one of them contains a black pearl. When the pearl goes missing, Mariam, who is also from the same village and is frequent visitor to Pak Yem, is accused of stealing it. Ali knows that Mariam is not a thief, although Mariam's stepmother Zaiton insists that it's her and banishes her from their house. Mariam has no choice but to stay with Pak Yem and Ali temporarily. Later, it was found out that Mariam's unkind brother-in-law-to-be, Rahman, had stolen the pearl and sold it to a general store, where Ali saw it displayed. Rahman's misdemeanor is revealed and Zaiton regrets her actions towards her stepdaughter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1955-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mutiara Dari Malaya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2601406,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laurie Friedman","original_name":"Laurie Friedman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fb56e5a78840124c22ba1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15419066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
