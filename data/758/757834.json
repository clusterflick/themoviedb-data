Today, renowned embalmer James Bryant puts his faith in a new generation to continue this vanishing legacy. However, his young intern, Clarence Pierre, meets him with resistance, conflicted about his commitment to carrying on embalming traditions and the judgment he feels from the Black community as a queer, Christian man. Taking place in the oldest Black funeral home in San Antonio, this poetic documentary examines the waning tradition of African American funeral homes.","popularity":0.3102,"poster_path":"/za96KwDeknXuMN3HdOQWvcVDV1H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's the end only if you let it be the end.","title":"The Passing On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Funeral Home","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Clarke","original_name":"Nathan Clarke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9778f6afa1b0003692e0e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Tunie","original_name":"Tamara Tunie","popularity":1.1615,"profile_path":"/1KM30uSzeB27UEY7ICtTVDf16CQ.jpg","credit_id":"5ffcf1c3fab3fa003c5025a3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2932674,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tyler Trumbo","original_name":"Tyler Trumbo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffcf1aba3b5e6003f3a5228","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2932674,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tyler Trumbo","original_name":"Tyler Trumbo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffcf1991d01910040a1a9bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2932673,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lana Garland","original_name":"Lana Garland","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffcf10f0c1255003ff660bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":174211,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Grant","original_name":"Tim Grant","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffcf1d4c8a5ac003eb1c954","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":174211,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Grant","original_name":"Tim Grant","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffcf1dfe9da690042842189","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8991754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1407,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vDMy3MIZ4QGlNT9yYnooe9HUTeS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1404,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wkmsH9s0ZYqABDjDFdZffHxaidZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2PJB44Kg2VAWUZD5dWuIwg9ysS6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":6.763,"height":114,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m8zwNGJXEzorDasjRIIQWDSphE.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":771}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/za96KwDeknXuMN3HdOQWvcVDV1H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":509},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nWJoRnWMwl4gzMVkCjsQhdqba4R.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Virginia Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tamara Tunie: A Funeral Home Kid","key":"zwQwjZ16Wfs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-06T15:27:30.000Z","id":"5ffcf317fdc4fa003e1faa28"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Passing On Trailer","key":"231933292","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-08-31T20:30:18.000Z","id":"5ffcf01377d23b003efa15a9"}]}}}
