To his dismay, his maternal grandfather has died but no one in the family, including his mother (Crystal LEE), is willing to talk about it or their feelings. His elder sister Yam (Isabelle CHAN), locks herself every day in her room and smokes.  ​His father (James AU) is always busy on the phone to take bets from sports gamblers. The family of four will soon move to a new place, but a shadow of estrangement looms above them. Getting drenched in sweat, sometimes by rain, Cheng discovers a melancholy reality, both old and new, in a city he calls home.","popularity":0.113,"poster_path":"/rjdtWnofJHfO0gSLNxlxcWkWojD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Shrimp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Choi","original_name":"Andy Choi","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb944901bf2660041942810","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2384552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crystal Lee","original_name":"Crystal Lee","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/q532HB4hqUpXSrGRKcIsbLvxXit.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb9449ad9f4a6004003b99d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Au","original_name":"James Au","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb944a4a24c50003f2fd527","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2864330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Chan","original_name":"陳逸寧","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/gvTlOWm6I5NPpOlkwujbbd4Gzq0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb944ab87ae7b003e519f38","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhilin Chen","original_name":"Zhilin Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb94486a6a4c100413f8714","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10757220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qeU5NCrkDAMyzFbHj6ysImLshHR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tsQZjju8KrvaMhqyfN3hLXP3JOZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":894,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rjdtWnofJHfO0gSLNxlxcWkWojD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Little Shrimp 何虾仔 - MulanIFF2019","key":"5mqx5MuvsHY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-03T01:54:58.000Z","id":"5fb944e887ae7b003d51671c"}]}}}
