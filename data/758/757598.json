The dramatic history of the Kyiv-Kostyantynivka train, with its passengers` unique fates, pain, memories, secrets, hopes, is a history of today Ukraine. Only 12.5 hours away from peaceful Kyiv is Kostyantynivka, a small industrial city in the eastern part of the country, immediately after which the front begins. This entire time people with different characters, social status, political views, and beliefs are traveling on the train side by side. They talk, debate, even quarrel, but speak to each other and go in a common direction. And what`s important, they all want to get to peace. This film is the voice of ordinary people, the search for dialogue and the path to a common future, where everyone’s voice will be heard.","popularity":0.5521,"poster_path":"/mqzKqCRaDChNTBjP6TCj5wfnfTW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134421,"logo_path":null,"name":"EasyLiving Films","origin_country":""},{"id":139349,"logo_path":"/iLTS9TQuLPYbGCrBYxYHOTd6WiX.png","name":"Ukrainian Cultural Foundation","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Train “Kyiv-War”","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","original_name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sDKUxnPBDIRnVMhUYNK3HNghRSK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f96b07f64de350037f115fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tasia Pugach","original_name":"Tasia Pugach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f96b08ea6725400370f940a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","original_name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sDKUxnPBDIRnVMhUYNK3HNghRSK.jpg","credit_id":"5f96b072a1074b0036f59874","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","original_name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sDKUxnPBDIRnVMhUYNK3HNghRSK.jpg","credit_id":"5f96b078c616ac00355f7fc3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11439628","wikidata_id":"Q116950553","facebook_id":"train.kyiv.war","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/mqzKqCRaDChNTBjP6TCj5wfnfTW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1654},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/InXTA2V7PCSsN8QEGDXk2cGzbm.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":191831,"name":"war zone"},{"id":244797,"name":"donbass war"},{"id":252606,"name":"russian invasion of ukraine (2022)"},{"id":257783,"name":"2010s"},{"id":272265,"name":"ukraine"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":278778,"name":"kyiv"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
