In the center of the picture is the struggle of the proletariat, led by the Bolshevik party, against tsarism. The demonstration of labor unrest is replaced by episodes of the Russo-Japanese war, Black-Hundred demonstrations, accompanied by a pogrom of Jews, and beating of the intelligentsia. The film paints the attitude of the Mensheviks towards armed insurrection, reproduces the picture of barricade battles, the arrest of the Council of Workers' Deputies and the brutal reprisals of the tsarist autocracy with revolutionaries.","popularity":0.3999,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13896,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kiev Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1931-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dress Rehearsal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2829991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Voyshvillo","original_name":"Vladimir Voyshvillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bolshevik worker","credit_id":"5f95cc1dafe2240043c920af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1540514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Franko","original_name":"Ivan Franko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Old soldier","credit_id":"5f95cc31d75bd6005296d4fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Gayvoronsky","original_name":"Mikhail Gayvoronsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Navy sailor","credit_id":"5f95cc58069f0e0036eb71ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2829993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arseni Kuts","original_name":"Arseni Kuts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Tsar Nikolay II","credit_id":"5f95cc70f18ce70038604903","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2829994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Malikov-Elvorti","original_name":"Иван Маликов-Эльворти","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Provocateur","credit_id":"5f95cc83d04d1a0033096f0f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mykola Nademskyi","original_name":"Микола Надемський","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/fw1Exl0fEJt1lS5oNkkYPUziI0W.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Menshevik","credit_id":"5f95ccb590ea4b0037665959","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonin Pankryshev","original_name":"Antonin Pankryshev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Captain","credit_id":"5f95ccdb84f2490036e4c4df","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1540516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavlo Petryk","original_name":"Pavlo Petryk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Student","credit_id":"5f95cd0846e75f003853e0bf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1461058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vyacheslav Gomolyaka","original_name":"Vyacheslav Gomolyaka","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Factory worker","credit_id":"5f95cd733a99370036a0e5b1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1583607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Smirnova","original_name":"Sofia Smirnova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"5f95cd98ed28b90039371349","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2315716,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivan Shekker","original_name":"Іван Шеккер","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611525a8c0a48017e0454ed","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2066523,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miron Bilinskiy","original_name":"Miron Bilinskiy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95caa099d5c30032d2e05b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2515016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Kolomoytsev","original_name":"Pavel Kolomoytsev","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95cadc99d5c30050d3108c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829985,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.
