It watches over the traffic moving to and from the docks, seemingly hearing and seeing everything from its own point of view. For some, the piano is a regular stop on their commute. Others, occasional travelers, encounter it in this unexpected space, inviting them, subject to their will. There, in the most bustling place is a piano that makes people take off their earphones and take part in something magical that requires no words. The piano is unplugged, the people unplug. How many of those who sit and play manage to transcend the external noise, reflecting in a different and challenging way the reality we live in, allowing us to look into ourselves?","popularity":0.159,"poster_path":"/x9bzEl4pW4WrqXvfDF7BDhjEzdK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ilan Yagoda Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tuning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"כיוון","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"התכווננות","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilan Yagoda","original_name":"Ilan Yagoda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f950da45a5ed00041784441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilan Yagoda","original_name":"Ilan Yagoda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f950db0d75bd60043958c1e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748118,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oron Adar","original_name":"Oron Adar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f950dda1fd36f005e46bda1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829156,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Amnon Houri","original_name":"Amnon Houri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f950e41d75bd60034959275","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2632352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amos Zipori","original_name":"Amos Zipori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f950e8dd75bd60052958b3e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1733558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rotem Dror","original_name":"Rotem Dror","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f950e9da128560aaebf7537","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13117092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iTHeZGY0eZOhQMx1JGmv3RiWuN1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x9bzEl4pW4WrqXvfDF7BDhjEzdK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5768,"name":"urban life"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
