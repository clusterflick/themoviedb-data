Emotional History follows Kaufman and Zaentz as they enlist the help of screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière and legendary film editor Walter Murch to turn the Kundera novel into an imaginative exploration of politics and eroticism, set against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. Our documentary goes in-depth to discover how indelible moments in the film - Lena Olin kneeling on a dressing mirror; Russian tanks invading Prague; Juliette Binoche photographing her boyfriend's nude mistress; became a part of cinematic history.","popularity":0.3276,"poster_path":"/99fGuwEnc52cl0OjthXzLuhBID2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leva FilmWorks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emotional History: The Making of 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":648,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philip Kaufman","original_name":"Philip Kaufman","popularity":0.3018,"profile_path":"/AtTB8qM4UsifYsKtEPgQSCibP5s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f973adb64de350036f2b9e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9747,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Claude Carrière","original_name":"Jean-Claude Carrière","popularity":0.4408,"profile_path":"/aBHANidKViiyTFj5JeMyrvp3l8x.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6266ff3ace6c4c0050652273","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Walter Murch","original_name":"Walter Murch","popularity":0.3001,"profile_path":"/kQh7U7kRLF9NKEMpxiGjZEIu0o3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6266ff415b4fed00a0f3d5ba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Saul Zaentz","original_name":"Saul Zaentz","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6266ff4c142ef10067a7dfcc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Leva","original_name":"Gary Leva","popularity":0.2628,"profile_path":"/dc81JTKO4CxgoQ0dzSKHd4YOeAB.jpg","credit_id":"5f973ac3194186003727983b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0778684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1182,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/99fGuwEnc52cl0OjthXzLuhBID2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
