Set in Cyprus, the plot involves enchanted and pastoral elements, love and its thwarting, the counterpointing of Man and God, sorcery, revelation and ultimate resolution, all accomplished in a brilliant series of scenes. A follower of Monteverdi, Cavalli reveals the influence of the older man but also his own pronounced independence. Fabio Biondi and Europa Galante have become one of the most admired partnerships in the history of baroque music performance.","popularity":0.0778,"poster_path":"/uoVy6ZOtSxZieEzdufk016pJqXM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cavalli: La Virtu De Strali D'Amore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacinta Nicotra","original_name":"Giacinta Nicotra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Caprice/Leucippo/Clarindo","credit_id":"5f968ddcbd32090035f13a6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gemma Bertagnolli","original_name":"Gemma Bertagnolli","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pleasure/Clito/Rumour","credit_id":"5f968de5a6725400390fde55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Sancho","original_name":"Juan Sancho","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9L7xGAdinrm34n5KzsQfgSJ2UAh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pallante","credit_id":"5f968dec1cc4ff003743f53b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristiana Arcari","original_name":"Cristiana Arcari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Erabana (Eumete)","credit_id":"5f968df4a6725400380fb44b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Invernizzi","original_name":"Roberta Invernizzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cleria/Venus","credit_id":"5f968dfba6725400380fb47b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2137204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Biondi","original_name":"Fabio Biondi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/kBrFdLE3WJP22OvWMEhJvazjciZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"6712d3a3097c3d7760f8da2e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Mancini","original_name":"Davide Mancini","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f968e7ca1074b0038f60835","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uoVy6ZOtSxZieEzdufk016pJqXM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
