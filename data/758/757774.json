The film is a personal statement of two people affected by or marked by a mental disorder - a father forced to live with it and a daughter who had to grow up with a sick and often absent father. During filming, they try to find understanding for each other while revealing their inner traumas. One of the secondary topics is what it is like to undergo treatment for a mental disorder in Romania, as the father expresses frustration with the way he and his condition are viewed by the local healthcare system.","popularity":0.1181,"poster_path":"/syWQYHQkGxliu7LdguDyBzJCrBq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Us Against Us","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ion Tarara","original_name":"Ion Tarara","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f97446b94d8a80037de71e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2831474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andra Tarara","original_name":"Andra Tarara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f9744751941860036275edf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2831474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andra Tarara","original_name":"Andra Tarara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9744576c0b3600360c0639","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anda Ionescu","original_name":"Anda Ionescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9744bca672540039115922","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2831474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andra Tarara","original_name":"Andra Tarara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9745d594d8a80037de744f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615704,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anamaria Antoci","original_name":"Anamaria Antoci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9744ac00fb6b0034b97132","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2831474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andra Tarara","original_name":"Andra Tarara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9744d96c0b3600340be137","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1640639,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Flora Pop","original_name":"Flora Pop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9744e31941860039272592","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2831474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andra Tarara","original_name":"Andra Tarara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9745e194d8a80038de81e4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ion Tarara","original_name":"Ion Tarara","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9745e93d4d960034838d73","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14211098","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bbAHCounJqIoaVhqW7NMGxnpafs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4RBClsFY6UNFUpHmte8BIWvBg80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wF8l62XFaOTadrid45tdZdVxGyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2040,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/syWQYHQkGxliu7LdguDyBzJCrBq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1360}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":240303,"name":"father daughter relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
