A. T. is a wry homage to classic movies, and a celebration of the infuriating glory of cats. An alluring and remote low-voiced woman (une chatte fatale, as it were) sings to us of her unmistakable feline nature. A shadowy upright-bass player is seen now and then, accompanying the cat's slow and confident jazz song. Sandra Boynton wrote, designed, and directed this stylish and clever short film.","popularity":0.1904,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C.A.T.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darcy Boynton","original_name":"Darcy Boynton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Cat","credit_id":"5f9829725bce9e0038af1f8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caitlin McEwan","original_name":"Caitlin McEwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Other Cat","credit_id":"5f9829a55bce9e0038af1fda","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Boynton","original_name":"Sandra Boynton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9829405bce9e0039aea76f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Boynton","original_name":"Sandra Boynton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f98294aafa1b0003793f990","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7271924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":977,"name":"cat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
