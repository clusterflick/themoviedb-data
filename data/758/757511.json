John Grierson and his National Film Board of Canada become targets of an anti-Communist blacklist in the immediate post-war years, after Soviet clerk Igor Gouzenko produced documents revealing a spy ring operating in Canada. With a cast featuring Eric Peterson as Grierson, Saul Rubinek as Gouzenko, and Aaron Schwartz as Communist Party MP Fred Rose, this forgotten piece of Canadian history is brought to life in a very compelling CBC drama.","popularity":0.4223,"poster_path":"/A8H5fEmOMRM359iXLLTI8BvzTd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grierson and Gouzenko","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Peterson","original_name":"Eric Peterson","popularity":0.3067,"profile_path":"/yDSXor1RJzjkfJ6sd7z3bqXMyZP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Grierson","credit_id":"618fe5f2c3c89100615f8d84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saul Rubinek","original_name":"Saul Rubinek","popularity":0.7236,"profile_path":"/oQQxpxDo7mULPsjhrPLFiZ6e2Ca.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gouzenko","credit_id":"618fe5fecf62cd008c80c613","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Schwartz","original_name":"Aaron Schwartz","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/luXQy3k2h1PA7jbllzhnIPjqwhl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"618fe60a0f2fbd002e479f82","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3307982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Kinch","original_name":"Martin Kinch","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fCG19wBGGJAqk8jFmKrJoMVXjbP.jpg","credit_id":"618fe6425f2b8d004286e4d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A8H5fEmOMRM359iXLLTI8BvzTd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
