After eight eventful years, in 1993 the band split, relaunching again in 2013 with Gnodâ€™s Neil Francis replacing original vocalist Boniface. Wages of the Imagination provides insight into the worlds of veterans Russel Smith (guitar/noise) and drummer John Jobbagy. The latter works as a gravedigger, whilst Smith tinkers with bikes in the French countryside, under the watchful eye of his mother.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zFCP5XmzZhI0BMhyNc8DWoRSThH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2019-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wages of the Imagination","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dries Meddens","original_name":"Dries Meddens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95634699d5c30032d23f7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dries Meddens","original_name":"Dries Meddens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95633e99d5c30050d267e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dries Meddens","original_name":"Dries Meddens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9563570fb17f0040381d3b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dries Meddens","original_name":"Dries Meddens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95634e8c0a480371d32caf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8804018","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xc2cIqyJ6pGLe68oeJOGtnMu6Z7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1984,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zFCP5XmzZhI0BMhyNc8DWoRSThH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1323}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2019-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
