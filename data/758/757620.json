Jacques, a private, leads his brother's company to attack when Honoré, a lieutenant, panics and flees. Jacques, dressed in Honoré's coat, wins a vital victory, but he is mistaken for Honoré and decorated for gallantry in his brother's name. Jacques assumes Honoré's identity and goes to Paris where he meets Honoré. Honoré, after a serious disagreement, plots to have Jacques murdered but is himself killed by mistake. Jacques finds happiness with Moira, Honoré's wife from a loveless war marriage of convenience.  'Honor First' was the first film Adorée and John Gilbert made together.","popularity":0.8899,"poster_path":"/oF4djz7G5KGcYgwZx9bmNWDppp4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Honor First","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Adorée","original_name":"Renée Adorée","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/kVVTpFum6WdJg9zJZgeKEYWY5Pu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Moira Serern","credit_id":"5f96c29f64de350039f0eef9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gilbert","original_name":"John Gilbert","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/wibrEasDmipryIht6W6ajxAAQgH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jacques Dubois / Honoré Duboois","credit_id":"5f96c2bd194186003826648f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardee Kirkland","original_name":"Hardee Kirkland","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/ye5vaJ6CCGmpxRUog4tieuJFUtC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Barry Serern","credit_id":"5f96c362a1074b0036f5b73e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannon Day","original_name":"Shannon Day","popularity":0.1834,"profile_path":"/wciC2BHSGbrBQDToZZrdzdJiF5w.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Piquette","credit_id":"5f96c3b92fe2fa003ab04115","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Wilson","original_name":"Clarence Wilson","popularity":0.2187,"profile_path":"/zi37Pkxd7IsNFjgdbbkK8apgtmr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Tricot (the Apache) (as Wilson Hummel)","credit_id":"669440c0319730473da7c012","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33959,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph F.
