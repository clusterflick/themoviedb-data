The idiosyncratic freethinkers were inspired by Californian technology visionaries and committed themselves to hacker ethics. All information must be free. Use public data, protect private data.

The story of the German hackers, told by the protagonists themselves in a montage of found video and audio material.","popularity":0.6079,"poster_path":"/lLU8YLvlwJVE3zSRtz8czycsNMZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Interzone Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Is One.
