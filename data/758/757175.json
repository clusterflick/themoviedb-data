He died in exile, ending a thousand years of monarchy. The royal family vanished, and the country was plunged into war and the longest military dictatorship of modern times. But after a century of silence they are back, and they're on a journey to bring the family - past and present - back together. Filmed through three years of seismic change in Burma, this is the story of a family and a country emerging from the darkness.","popularity":0.3326,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":142453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grammar Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Were Kings (Burma's Lost Royals)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Bescoby","original_name":"Alex Bescoby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95055e134d580adc29ffe8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Bescoby","original_name":"Alex Bescoby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f950570a12856004cbf6454","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11860690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2471,"name":"monarchy"},{"id":228804,"name":"union of myanmar (burma)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
