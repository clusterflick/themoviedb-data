The 'Friday Night Setlist' features a rock & roll oriented lineup, with The Mess Hall, and The City Lights brushing shoulders with Detroit's The Electric Six and Welsh angst-merchants Mclusky. 'Saturday Night Setlist' steps up a gear with The Butterfly Effect, After The Fall, and Shihad shredding up the stage. Before long Saturday winds it's way into darker territory with menacing performances by The Icarus Line & Tourettes. Stoner rock fans will be delighted to find a 21 minute track by Brant Bjork & the Bros (ex-Kyuss) just before the coup-de-gras delivered by The Dillinger Escape Plan.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bHm7VTajuTfblz40yXkuxqA8UKC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Livecast","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":177,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fuck This, I'm Going To The Annandale","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2179,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHm7VTajuTfblz40yXkuxqA8UKC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1452}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"MA 15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
