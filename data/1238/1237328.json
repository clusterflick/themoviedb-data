Writer, comedian and art lover Jenny Eclair meets people doing extraordinary things with knitting, cross-stitch, banners and felt to change hearts and minds.  Hearing stories from craftivists around the UK and beyond, Jenny visits Bradford on Avon in Wiltshire to see how miniature knickers are discreetly placed around the town to encourage screening for cervical cancer, and learns how felt 'graffiti' has a wellbeing message for visitors to a London park.  From banners at Liverpool Football Club's Anfield Stadium to a huge memorial quilt remembering those who lost their lives to Aids, the initiatives all have one thing in common: a painstaking, thoughtful and beautiful way to get heard.","popularity":0.2106,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can you use craft to help make the world a better place, one stitch at a time?","title":"Craftivism: Making A Difference","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":215827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Eclair","original_name":"Jenny Eclair","popularity":0.2907,"profile_path":"/cUXapU5wSsiVt2cP1FYZB6P32SS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b6a7798741c401639122df","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14606022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
