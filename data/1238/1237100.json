Candid and comical interviews with staff and patients in six countries will reveal that methadone has saved and improved the lives of countless people addicted to opioids and at the same time, rigid rules–attending clinic six days a week, limited hours, random urine screens– make their lives incredibly difficult. In 2017, 70,000 people died from an opioid-related overdose. Methadone is the gold standard of treatment for heroin addiction. The problem is it's more difficult to get than heroin.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4NKU4FRjP1WvdR4FyeUsJebQQxZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Takes you inside the hidden world of methadone clinics.","title":"Liquid Handcuffs: A Documentary to Free Methadone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilena Marchetti","original_name":"Marilena Marchetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2d7db02208c67c88d8e73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Redmond","original_name":"Helen Redmond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2d7f6583c56cdb1266980","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11241604","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4NKU4FRjP1WvdR4FyeUsJebQQxZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1408}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Reel Recovery Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
