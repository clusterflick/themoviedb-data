Pit","overview":"We had noise rock lunatics Daughters take over the back room at The Gutter, our favorite Brooklyn dive bar.  More like an old-world religious service than a rock concert, the Daughters K! Pit has to be seen to be believed. Between leaping into the crowd, breaking lights, riding the audience members like horses, and smashing the mic into his forehead until he drew blood, frontman Alexis S. F. Marshall spewed dissonant and eldritch lyrics about hope, death, madness, humanity, and what it means to be a creature made of meat in a world that hates you. The result will be beautiful to some and unsettling to others, but exciting and impossible to look away from for everyone.
