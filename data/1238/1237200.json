The Tumba Francesa Societies, which were known as a brotherhood and a mutual aid network, emerged from these waves of slave migrations. Eventually, they became integral constituents of Cuban culture. La Tumba Mambi is a docu-fiction film based on the Tumba Francesa, La Caridad de Oriente, which is located in the city of Santiago de Cuba. Through the Society's youngest member, Flavio, who is collecting information about the Tumba Francesa for a school project, we meet his grand-mother Andrea and mother Queli, two charismatic knowledge keepers of their rich cultural traditions. The original film soundtrack composed and produced by Cuban based DJ Jigüe, in collaboration with Tumba Francesa members, is a rhythmic and striking reminder that the present is grounded in a history of struggles for freedom.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1QSHV3mIvEgYUETyhuMpPVjkUMd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2023-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tumba Mambi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Ритми на свободата","type":"festival title"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Ритми свободи","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isnay Rodriguez","original_name":"Isnay Rodriguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b65f5860c51d0184d257cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier","original_name":"Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b65f3cb6cff10149f69f83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31070696","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1QSHV3mIvEgYUETyhuMpPVjkUMd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian edition","release_date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Ethnographic Film Festival of Quebec","release_date":"2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La Tumba Mambi-Trailler","key":"dshM6iNorTw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-03T11:36:58.000Z","id":"65b65ec30d294401645aca4b"}]}}}
