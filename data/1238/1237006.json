It is based on live action shooting done that same afternoon on the Campo dei Fiori where the philosopher Giordano Bruno was burned by the Inquisition in 1600. A commemorative statue was erected in the 19th century, that somberly dominate the market held everyday on the piazza. The film is about the resurgence of the past in this place where normal daily activities go on imperturbably. The capture of the performance was reworked, shortened and complemented with more studio performances.","popularity":0.7867,"poster_path":"/c9wd6H6tedXIbttQJ8G6Ayp1zvh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Statue of Giordano Bruno","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","title":"La Statua di Giordano Bruno","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"65b595512faf4d00e7dbfc1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"65b595584f33ad01310bca1e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292746,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Ostertag","original_name":"Bob Ostertag","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/spm34iHDOlrwDAuxzDZKHUA121S.jpg","credit_id":"65b595692faf4d00e7dbfc26","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292746,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Ostertag","original_name":"Bob Ostertag","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/spm34iHDOlrwDAuxzDZKHUA121S.jpg","credit_id":"65b5969bf6596f0163fe7897","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q49713447","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1875,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c9wd6H6tedXIbttQJ8G6Ayp1zvh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":588,"name":"rome, italy"},{"id":6232,"name":"monument"},{"id":207427,"name":"statue"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"25 FPS Festival","release_date":"2007-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
