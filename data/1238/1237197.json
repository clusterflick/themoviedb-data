This unlikely wish takes a film director and her three girls to Gyütö, where a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, perched high, echoes day and night the sound of sacred tantric chants of meditation, «which sound like the waves of the ocean». Wandering freely about wherever their curiosity leads them, they discover the daily life of 400 monks living there. Over time, a dialogue develops and a growing complicity emerges. From this intimate immersion, a film takes form, unfolding like a wave both visually and in sound. The reality of Buddhism is revealed in a way that is unprecedented, in the spontaneity of the questions asked, as well as with the sensitive understanding of a child's point of view and with no proselytization at all.","popularity":0.0995,"poster_path":"/gmtn19sxPd2FWJcB5KOf76Wd4xm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gyütö","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4504491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Filipa Cardoso","original_name":"Filipa Cardoso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b65ccef6596f0163ff3812","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4504491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Filipa Cardoso","original_name":"Filipa Cardoso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b65cef58efd3017ccb97b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4504491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Filipa Cardoso","original_name":"Filipa Cardoso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b65cdf0d294401645ac98d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31070511","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gmtn19sxPd2FWJcB5KOf76Wd4xm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian edition","release_date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"GYÜTÖ - Trailer","key":"D6YRpuVhWec","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-05T17:16:35.000Z","id":"65b65c7d0d294401645ac93e"}]}}}
