While preserving a large library of vintage Hollywood optical sound effects, the filmmaker became attracted to the sounds of slates, discussions, splices, and noise. These sounds were created, with much effort, to enhance specific narrative images. But these sounds can also tell a story as involving as the films they were created for. A silent picture edit was created from leftover narrative film footage. Like the sounds, the shots contain no specific narratives. The sounds and images were finally combined, forming relationships that set up and subvert narrative expectations. Begin is also a valentine to the craft of filmmaking.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/36ldhclNVljAinXJNvrlqh4xboG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Begin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Smith","original_name":"Craig Smith","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b8339f46e75f0161ba1087","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/36ldhclNVljAinXJNvrlqh4xboG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Patricia Mellencamp 2018 Save the Archives Film Festival, Milwaukee  - World Premiere","release_date":"2018-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
