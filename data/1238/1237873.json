Political persecution of the Alevi-Kurdish family in Turkey, the flight to Europe in 1989, several racist attacks, depression and excessive demands on the parents – the effects on the three siblings are different. Dealing with the experiences and strokes of fate causes different reactions in them. Bektaş quickly realizes that the uncertainty about Taner’s fate in Turkey is only a reflection of her life experience as a family in exile.","popularity":0.1629,"poster_path":"/u1j4WwQ6TYqpZ7KDnaHkdbhapGE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183512,"logo_path":"/vWRTWhHuKY4016qLBC3dGjYtgAn.png","name":"Pink Shadow
