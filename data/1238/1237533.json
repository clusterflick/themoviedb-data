Municipal Waste is without a doubt the tightest Richmond band around right now. They’re hugely important in sparking this resurgence of thrash that we’ve seen over the last decade, and they have only gotten tighter with age. It's definitely a must for any fan of the band as it captures the true essence of a Municipal Waste show, with crazy stage-diving, raucous circle pits, comic inflatable sharks and rapping wizards adding to the musical mayhem.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hM4Hv24uMJclmCwzCJUVFSF28Gu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Municipal Waste: Live In Richmond 2006","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hM4Hv24uMJclmCwzCJUVFSF28Gu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1408}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Municipal Waste Live in Richmond 2006 (Official Trailer)","key":"TzQWIuCCDF8","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2006-09-22T16:30:08.000Z","id":"65b7289bd55c3d017cfa70ce"}]}}}
