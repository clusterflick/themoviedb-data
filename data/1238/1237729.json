However, whilst there seems to be overlap between gestures and sign language, they differ too, as the protagonists of the movie show and tell us. The film \"Ishaare\" documents how six deaf signers communicate with familiar and unfamiliar hearing shopkeepers, street vendors, customers, waiters, ticket conductors and fellow travellers in Mumbai.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/b5htZCUGkJiMjobTE9fxE8WZObV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ishaare: Gestures and Signs in Mumbai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4506451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annelies Kusters","original_name":"Annelies Kusters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b7bd9d0fb17f017b34ed52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21401286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b5htZCUGkJiMjobTE9fxE8WZObV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
