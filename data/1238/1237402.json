Rediscovering their forgotten bucket list from senior year, they embark on a riotous adventure to fulfill the wild dreams of their youth â€“ skinny dipping in the community pool, making out with boys, and even a daring shoplifting spree. But there's one small problem: the lubberly sheriff is hot on their trail, determined to catch them in the act. As they hilariously elude his every move or underestimate his tenacity, their friendship is tested by their mischievous escapades and the looming threat of getting caught. A heartfelt comedy where two lifelong friends face off against the hapless sheriff, creating mischief, mayhem and memories that will last a lifetime.","popularity":0.4225,"poster_path":"/8onFG1rT3soY7ca6SPEXqKtfQL1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big C Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Two women, a sheriff, and a high school bucket list.
