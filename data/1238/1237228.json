I was wondering what it would mean to place in the same economic system fan art that was, in turn, the same product (an artwork) offered by another artist. Besides questioning the meaning of authorship, quotationism, copyright, production and post-production I want to play on the limits of privacy and emotional attachment in a fan vs celebrity dimension.  I have therefore developed a complex fan-fiction where I am the girlfriend of an esteemed artist, Jon Rafman, who now becomes meme, now \"senpai\" (a name often used in manga by shy girls referring to a boy, perhaps barely known, which they have fallen in love with), now a sort of contemporary art Justin Bieber ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","popularity":0.1625,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"edgy time with mom","title":"edgy time with mom (twee whistler)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4504550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"twee whistler","original_name":"twee whistler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"director","credit_id":"65b671744f33ad017a0ce5a8","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
