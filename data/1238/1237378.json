Garfield and his best frenemy Odie are mangled through a series of VCRs and circuit  bent machinery, leaving a traumatic stain on the otherwise joyous ritual of dressing up, begging  for candy, and being chased around by pirate ghosts. The audio is broken down and reassembled  by Montreal experimental-electronic artist Event Cloak, leaving no soundwave untouched. Bonus:  broadcast commercials included.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/ggMzwXrIRkwBm7LpLR4mPcCos17.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ǝɹnʇuǝʌp∀ uǝǝʍollɐH s,plǝᴉɟɹɐפ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Feulner","original_name":"Rob Feulner","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mm6iKUFnQMvbyVpczhFlX2prcAI.jpg","credit_id":"65b6be8c0cd32a0163e59f5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":940,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ggMzwXrIRkwBm7LpLR4mPcCos17.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":629}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
