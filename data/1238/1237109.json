The original is a comic of the same name by Yuji Aoki. The script was written by Ryoichi Kimizuka of \"Bayside Shakedown\", and it is a comical and fast-paced work. Tatsuyuki Haibara (Masahiro Nakai), a young man who joined Naniwa's financial company, Imperial Finance, is \"the best financial company in Osaka\" while witnessing the sadness, thickness, and warmth of human beings who are at the mercy of money. It is impressive to follow the figure of aiming for. By arranging attractive female guests, themes that tend to be raw, such as debt and debt collection, can be made to look friendly and gorgeous. His senior who leads Haibara, Kuwata (Kaoru Kobayashi), and other astringent men are also a must-see.","popularity":0.3854,"poster_path":"/4wxsLuYm1HDOggaDCcL0BXq7Amg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way of Osaka Financing 1","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahiro Nakai","original_name":"中居正広","popularity":0.3082,"profile_path":"/hxMaK9pRM2krA67FeIPMJlbGij1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65b627532faf4d0163dcf159","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinichi Tsutsumi","original_name":"堤真一","popularity":0.4493,"profile_path":"/t3E5FKE7UGbdlnA8gy9lx03otIk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65b6275f0d2944017f5ac29b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaoru Kobayashi","original_name":"小林薫","popularity":0.8178,"profile_path":"/pJSt6nRgcIsli0hw2aOCzc2l622.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65b62791b6cff10149f68c53","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eri Fukatsu","original_name":"深津絵里","popularity":1.0426,"profile_path":"/xlSYQwDHZaXRFVh29JfRlu4EedP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65b627a41c635b017b147bbd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katsuhiko Watabiki","original_name":"綿引勝彦","popularity":0.3745,"profile_path":"/uD0WXkusTzN5v0NZwItW8y0F1uo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65b6282a60c51d0184d22e43","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Ogata","original_name":"緒形拳","popularity":0.7302,"profile_path":"/5S55DfJWCNhuqhT5F4YM9nuHiml.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65b628470d294401645aaeb0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetsushi Tanaka","original_name":"田中哲司","popularity":0.5473,"profile_path":"/9DHDP2thxiholidGe6WKr38suJz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65b6285e4f33ad01610bff36","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bunshi Katsura VI","original_name":"Bunshi Katsura Vi","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/nndJZXsxHqRPor6K8KZicUjMZgE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65b62875afe224016339942e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tokue Hanazawa","original_name":"花沢徳衛","popularity":0.5005,"profile_path":"/1uHrAp1aieQw2hgmkhaBDSgxMLD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65b62899afe22401843a27b8","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222282,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryôichi Kimizuka","original_name":"君塚良一","popularity":0.1654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b6272d4f33ad01470b99ac","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4201982,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuuji Aoki","original_name":"Yuuji Aoki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b6270eb6cff10163f73003","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31070320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/4wxsLuYm1HDOggaDCcL0BXq7Amg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1996-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
