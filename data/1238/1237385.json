The film experienced a brief run in theaters and drive-ins in both New England and in the Southern USA, before ultimately disappearing. Through rare photographs and footage, as well as interviews with those sharing their personal stories about the production for the very first time, Sasqua: The Lost Bigfoot Film of Massachusetts will take viewers back into the New England woods in the hope of understanding what happened to this nearly 50-year old lost monster movie.","popularity":0.2444,"poster_path":"/acjBFoZKVMIE1rxTgwhGkUAgdR5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chapman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":219446,"logo_path":"/g7OoXvHfy6vQmqVYQhATZ4ocKD3.png","name":"The Luna Theater","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Sasqua: The Lost Bigfoot Film of Massachusetts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2103977,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen R.
