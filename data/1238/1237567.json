Schiff describes Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major, Op. 15 from 1795 as “absolutely huge in its concept for that time. I've always thought that there's something Shakespearean about Beethoven in the way comedy, tragedy, drama, and tenderness are all present at the same time.”  Filmed in black and white, this concert is a beautiful showcase of craftsmanship and musicality. Schiff sits at a period-accurate recreation of a historic 1822 fortepiano crafted by Conrad Graf. He is joined by The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment for a captivating, historically informed, performance.  This concert was filmed on 6 June 2022 at Southbank Centre’s Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.","popularity":0.1291,"poster_path":"/mqX5SWIkOUISR9UZh9G4U3ArqdS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven
