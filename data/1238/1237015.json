Yet, in May 2007, Hitchens did just that - and his experience profoundly impacted both himself and his stance on the matter, prompting him to declare he'd been wrong, and later to publish his 2008 article for Vanity Fair's August issue, simply titled 'Believe Me, It's Torture'.","popularity":0.2393,"poster_path":"/1qjtD8m87dAuGnPP7FUojlDwR0Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What more can be added to the debate over U.S. interrogation methods, and whether waterboarding is torture?
