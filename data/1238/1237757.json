Yet, through remorse and regret – and after a seemingly miraculous return to life – the ending is one of forgiveness and reconciliation.  The Winter's Tale received ecstatic praise at its premiere for its intelligent, distinctive and emotionally powerful story, told through exquisite dance. It is now widely judged to be a modern ballet classic.","popularity":0.3227,"poster_path":"/mQFhpXWa725dFRfrCQWuG0cC2Ig.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winter's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Cuthbertson","original_name":"Lauren Cuthbertson","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/rhQZRPEORYv9dFYSNREXkVmcbYz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hermione","credit_id":"65b7ce818cfcc70148e51370","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1559914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryoichi Hirano","original_name":"Ryoichi Hirano","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/86cRe0kbI2jawjpjfBuSnwNOTky.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leontes","credit_id":"65b7cef29ba86a0148f8b737","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1426934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Lamb","original_name":"Sarah Lamb","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/o3YDnVb0k5Aweu3RmF62sr0HVcz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Perdita","credit_id":"65b7cefea0b690017bcfa031","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vadim Muntagirov","original_name":"Vadim Muntagirov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8IK658TGbfD7xpGFov5jOllruTx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Florizel","credit_id":"65b7cf0ba284eb017c0c1507","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Morera","original_name":"Laura Morera","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":"/qr3rNVoqr2XOxFojjYFsvAgJSo1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Paulina","credit_id":"65b7cf185e14e5017baee42d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Ball","original_name":"Matthew Ball","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/k2uWLdUrMzAylzoT8XffJnnLjNN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Polixenes","credit_id":"65b7cf288cfcc7017ce69a82","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2789667,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Seligman","original_name":"Tom Seligman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"65b7cf409ba86a017bf9e113","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ania Safonova","original_name":"Ania Safonova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Associate Concert Master","credit_id":"65b7cf51a0b690017bcfa086","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","original_name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Orchestra","credit_id":"65b7cf5d0fb17f017b34fb0b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1426940,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Natasha Katz","original_name":"Natasha Katz","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b7cfa40cd32a017ce7b376","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281068,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christopher Wheeldon","original_name":"Christopher Wheeldon","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/9YdcuyIbHohjxi4Jbvgrv1lrkzm.jpg","credit_id":"65b7cf76dbad500149849eaf","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joby Talbot","original_name":"Joby Talbot","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/gCMvTUXoN31VfKxFZ5UX13qBkgq.jpg","credit_id":"65b7cf911089ba017df8229f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093779,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bob Crowley","original_name":"Bob Crowley","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":"/apaKuwJFP81bda7x63ChitCOxFN.jpg","credit_id":"65b7cfb7a284eb017c0c1578","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sRuol4rvX1dblyOHfQiBcYOwTXh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1286,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mQFhpXWa725dFRfrCQWuG0cC2Ig.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":857}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
