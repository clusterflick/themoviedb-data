While dating, their parent also fell in love. Some twists of events happened, like the sudden break-up of their parent due to Edgar’s grandmother’s disapproval of her son’s relationship to Vi’s mother who is a night club singer, which was a societal taboo for the upper class during those days (the 60s-70s). Another twist was the kidnapping of Vilma. But all we’re ironed out in the end, just in time for the final musical production number, showing the whole gang dancing and singing to Vilma’s hit song, “Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Love You!”","popularity":0.1352,"poster_path":"/31EYqw8pxVenzR6MMvuo6Y515Kw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jela Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1970-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgar Loves Vilma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vilma Santos","original_name":"Vilma Santos","popularity":1.2487,"profile_path":"/oMegHEacDy1ZbVgsrOwcPQ3KL4m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65b5f301b1131f018d2a1a58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Mortiz","original_name":"Edgar Mortiz","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":"/gyCo8ffRO6DMLY87ffIud1yDTvU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65b5f3126e0d7200ca471be6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":262129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Perla Bautista","original_name":"Perla Bautista","popularity":0.4246,"profile_path":"/5yksMeQ0jjWlWgJNmZwFb2xZh8q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65b5f31ab1131f014929808f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1075166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Walter","original_name":"Mary Walter","popularity":0.1574,"profile_path":"/zbVkLdSp80adgOLOZJDWuMiIxyy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65b5f323b1131f017229d47c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1958767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonardo L.
