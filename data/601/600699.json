Instead, he has chosen English nobleman Lord Lovelace as the ideal fianc√© for Maud. On the night that the engagement is to be announced, however, she elopes with Cecil. The runaways are caught, though, after which, because of her loyalty to her brother, Maud sends Cecil away. When the Civil War begins, Howard, Lovelace and Cecil all volunteer, and are all soon reported killed in action. Heartbroken, Maud decides to become a nun, and takes her vows just moments before Cecil, whose death was mistakenly reported, returns from the battlefield and comes to the convent to ask her to marry him.","popularity":0.4185,"poster_path":"/4VnLgMJSiBv0wiIonHaN9K3wtM7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naked Hearts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francelia Billington","original_name":"Francelia Billington","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/273n4j88dNdgCLNWebxF67TfDWz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Maud","credit_id":"5cd1114fc3a3680b70da4f31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Julian","original_name":"Rupert Julian","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/9dWgryyjsLz1dw9cxMNvuB5piEh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cecil","credit_id":"5cd11157c3a3680efbd9d146","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Rae","original_name":"Zoe Rae","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/edT6F4HPcUfAijHSZRlfoLzVy6o.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Maud -
