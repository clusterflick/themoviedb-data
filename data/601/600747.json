The night on the Eve of 1947. The war veteran Victor is going to a girl that he loves. The day earlier he was unloading railroad cars to buy a nice present for Helya. Helya is from Poland, a student of the Moscow Conservatoire. Victor and Helya will see the New Year in at their friend’s. Only one night when all secrets are revealed, when the feelings are poured out, but circumstances dictate their own rules. Victor and Helya are made for each other, but they are facing a choice — of the country where to live, of love or career. All of us have to make a choice in our life. When the day breaks, the fate of the two heroes will be decided.","popularity":0.1094,"poster_path":"/l8NgnSf15MZuCtWiU4rYnNFKhIH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aftertaste","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Poslevkusie","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kseniya Shcherbakova","original_name":"Kseniya Shcherbakova","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/kx5XutlIXbKVeRQ3aNmsKPcdGoN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gelya","credit_id":"5cd1664b0e0a262d7b0303bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valery Ushakov","original_name":"Valery Ushakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Viktor","credit_id":"5cd166afc3a368472ddaff49","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgy Zaozersky","original_name":"Georgy Zaozersky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd166fb92514104812f5b04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgy Zaozersky","original_name":"Georgy Zaozersky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd167499251410b622613c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257041,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ruben Dishdishyan","original_name":"Рубен Дишдишян","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/u4YDwOnWAwHSnvvpfbWb5rnBnWO.jpg","credit_id":"5cd167510e0a26098102e928","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dmitry Osinkin","original_name":"Dmitry Osinkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd167679251417cce2d3150","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306951,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anton Mironovich","original_name":"Anton Mironovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd167ab0e0a264a95004461","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30400,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexey Aygi","original_name":"Алексей Айги","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/faJ0r92kBYyxXrBWYRvU2w8NUuR.jpg","credit_id":"5cd167e40e0a264a950044a3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2306952,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Darya Telegina","original_name":"Darya Telegina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd167f59251417df726326f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306953,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Konstantin Kobtsev","original_name":"Konstantin Kobtsev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd16831c3a3683697dd3e6e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/l8NgnSf15MZuCtWiU4rYnNFKhIH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Festival of Russian Cinema \"Budem zhit\"","release_date":"2018-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
