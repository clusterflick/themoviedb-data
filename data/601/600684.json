Returning home from a performance one night, Jane is disgusted to find her husband Robert McNaughton victimized by a tubercular cough and so banishes him and her young daughter to a sanitarium in Colorado. Years pass, finding Jane still estranged from her family. On the opening night of her new play, Jane finds herself upstaged and outperformed by Gloria Cromwell, a rising young actress, who, unknown to Jane, is her abandoned daughter. Returning home, Jane is haunted by visions of her husband and child and begins to sob. Looking up from her pillow, she is startled to see her husband with Gloria.","popularity":0.5495,"poster_path":"/1kwZRkxGDoXf4FXvfdhkfWeQSFN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nazimova Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"AS THE WOMAN WHO RELINQUISHED WITH A SHRUG THOSE THINGS IN LIFE MOST WOMEN HOLD MOST DEAR-FOR WHAT?..SHE WAS LATER TO LEARN.","title":"Madame Peacock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alla Nazimova","original_name":"Alla Nazimova","popularity":0.1902,"profile_path":"/vD0vhqW4ScjTV20jQKmw6L9HJIu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jane Goring / Gloria Cromwell","credit_id":"5cd10ac49251417df725abe0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170188,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Probert","original_name":"George Probert","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Robert McNaughton","credit_id":"5cd10acb92514104812ee128","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Steppling","original_name":"John Steppling","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/3bmmaV4I0GfFNLkflGq8z00YMZR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Rudolph Cleeberg","credit_id":"5cd10ae59251417be1283c12","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":244289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Orlamond","original_name":"William Orlamond","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/2lWrKjMjLDLMbDGPguvaQ60YLHh.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lewis","credit_id":"5cd10af1c3a3683b2ed86c99","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Cherryman","original_name":"Rex Cherryman","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/mX516Aco5TZs9SIc7ndNbgluvIx.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Thorne","credit_id":"5cd10af992514104812ee1ae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert R.
