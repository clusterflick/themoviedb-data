An accident causes his luck to turn bad and results in him turning blind, but he later regains his sight after being instrumental in saving the life of Mickey Malone, the team's young mascot. He then promises Mary Malone, Mickey's sister, for whose affection he has been competing with a teammate, that he is through showing off and bragging. But, in the end, he is still blowing smoke.","popularity":0.5237,"poster_path":"/8IkVshyXnwNNQ4MILb5zGsLrjud.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"KING OF THE DIAMOND - HE WAS THE WRONG GUY TO THE RIGHT GIRL!","title":"Swellhead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Ford","original_name":"Wallace Ford","popularity":0.5289,"profile_path":"/icHpMpE6QRTGgIACyCLtfjlqSEG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Terry McCall","credit_id":"625061a7383df20fcb7809be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dickie Moore","original_name":"Dickie Moore","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":"/AfhuD2u9Rotk0S51qIVWqZOpprv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Billy Malone","credit_id":"625061b5109cd000669064cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Kent","original_name":"Barbara Kent","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/277aj5dFqKXFkkGcFVLwolyyHrH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Malone","credit_id":"625061c3fd6300103f374585","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
