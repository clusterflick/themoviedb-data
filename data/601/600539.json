It can be considered as the cinematographic equivalent of Tristan Tzara's method on how to make a dadaist poem by putting words in a bag, and it mostly rises from Isidore Isou's film enthusiasm. The film has been made in fact out of elements of film strips found in the trashcan of a film development laboratory, that have been subsequently taped together bit by bit following the exact order they were originally gathered.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/9LbznE1AxHPjFKbVJ1JMYwtrAiH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1968-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une Oeuvre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Lemaître","original_name":"Maurice Lemaître","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd07dac0e0a26098101b583","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9LbznE1AxHPjFKbVJ1JMYwtrAiH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Cinémathèque Française","release_date":"1968-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
