No old-fashioned prude, the Reverend tries to see the positive side of the juke joint activities, knowing that the jitterbuggers are basically decent kids who just need to blow off a little steam. But the preacher sees red when the club opens on the Sabbath, threatening to turn the good townsfolk into Sunday sinners. An upcoming dance contest seems destined to become a showdown between the powers of light and darkness.","popularity":0.2093,"poster_path":"/xxrBYzhl7maOOGOUhsC2l6Cz3uE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colonnade Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":135011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthur Dreifuss Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":135012,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldberg Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunday Sinners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":89941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Astwood","original_name":"Norman Astwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gene Aiken","credit_id":"5cd1dbfe0e0a260981039f15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Mae Harris","original_name":"Edna Mae Harris","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/tjBqirnGpsqaylYbTuNDaVtIpG2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Corrine Aiken","credit_id":"5cd1dc19c3a36836c1e4eb9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristola Williams","original_name":"Cristola Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Creola, the singer","credit_id":"5cd1dc3ac3a36836c1e4ebd2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":993256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Easton","original_name":"Sidney Easton","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Bootsie","credit_id":"5ed6fe26c4f552001ebf9c29","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Dreifuss","original_name":"Arthur Dreifuss","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":"/co218nPXeCE9nzOWNMtXPRwejLs.jpg","credit_id":"5cd1dbe20e0a262fb30aa41d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547776,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Wilson","original_name":"Frank Wilson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6f3d2c4f552001fc0f20e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1005642,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vincent Valentini","original_name":"Vincent Valentini","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6f3d8c4f552001dbe9c5b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1947566,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack Goldberg","original_name":"Jack Goldberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6f3ef0398ab0022cf9717","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279015,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Donald Heywood","original_name":"Donald Heywood","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6f3f721c4ca001fe1dfb2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128624,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Webber","original_name":"George Webber","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6fb5dc4f552001fc101ab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140282,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert O.
