When renewed US sanctions in 2018 caused a currency collapse in Iran, the vulnerable population of migrants—often working as low-paid labourers in harsh conditions—was severely affected by the recession. Now, large numbers of them want to return home. Bahman Kiarostami (the son of late acclaimed director Abbas Kiarostami) sets up his camera in a Tehran-based facility processing thousands of illegals leaving the country. The migrants are asked surprising personal questions about everything from religion to drugs to family issues. With a Wiseman-esque fly-on-the-wall observation of these surprising interrogation sessions, Kiarostami paints a kaleidoscopic, empathetic and often humorous picture of the Afghans' place in Iranian society and their reasons for leaving it.","popularity":0.0767,"poster_path":"/epYw7nkgXEeyloNU1wH3yNl9M9N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exodus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Kiarostami","original_name":"Bahman Kiarostami","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/8fuckijhQ5ERfQV4wXEHV9bsuiT.jpg","credit_id":"5cce6c780e0a260981fe95ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Kiarostami","original_name":"Bahman Kiarostami","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/8fuckijhQ5ERfQV4wXEHV9bsuiT.jpg","credit_id":"5cce6c92c3a36836b0dfbbb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Kiarostami","original_name":"Bahman Kiarostami","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/8fuckijhQ5ERfQV4wXEHV9bsuiT.jpg","credit_id":"5cce6cb3c3a36836bedf49d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Kiarostami","original_name":"Bahman Kiarostami","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/8fuckijhQ5ERfQV4wXEHV9bsuiT.jpg","credit_id":"5cce6cd0c3a36836b0dfbbe5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2305086,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Davoud Maleki","original_name":"Davoud Maleki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cce6d080e0a262d7bfe8b5b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39399,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amir-Hossein Ghasemi","original_name":"Amir-Hossein Ghasemi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cce6d3d0e0a260981fe96ce","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9813978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/epYw7nkgXEeyloNU1wH3yNl9M9N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":685}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
