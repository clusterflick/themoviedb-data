Ernestine convinces the count to marry her despite his daughter's strenuous objections and then gains complete control of his fortune. Her steady milking of his funds makes the count decide to kill himself, but just as he is about to do it, Malgat, who has managed to catch up with Ernestine, exposes her to the authorities. Then, instead of the count, it is Ernestine who commits suicide rather than submit to arrest. A lost film.","popularity":0.4071,"poster_path":"/vgYsQzZp7sv4mav9lkOqLwMCmpa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Evil Women Do","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Clique of Gold","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1906702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Jane Wilson","original_name":"Elsie Jane Wilson","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/zrDPw5midHhToOEJUB6G0lWcq7m.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd0eae70e0a2631b8037ad9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francelia Billington","original_name":"Francelia Billington","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/273n4j88dNdgCLNWebxF67TfDWz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd0eaee0e0a262d7b0263be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Julian","original_name":"Rupert Julian","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/9dWgryyjsLz1dw9cxMNvuB5piEh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd0eaf40e0a262fb3094c9d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hobart Henley","original_name":"Hobart Henley","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/yse0OtdRlXTdx15QPVOzMQwkziW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd0eafb9251412236245495","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
