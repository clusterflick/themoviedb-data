It's a two disc retrospective on a career's worth of songs that are every bit as electrifying now as when they were first recorded. Coryell is a monster on guitar throughout the show, and Bernard Pretty Purdie (a legend in his own right) is on drums. Special guests James Valentine (Maroon 5) and David Hidalgo (Los Lobos) drop by to show off their talents in homage to Coryell. Through several interviews and segments of rehearsal footage we can see how the music is created, or that until this release, Coryell has always been the best kept secret. Bonus features include: Morning Sickness, Stiff Neck, Beautiful Woman, Valentine Rehearsal, Half A Heart, Slow Blues, Hidalgo Rehearsal, Souls Dirge, Souls Meeting, Additional Songs, Interviews, Rehearsals, Beyond This Chilling Winds, Spaces (Infinite), Dragon Gate","popularity":0.2277,"poster_path":"/3Q2vTasmbMlm9qaIjBXDDcKS8gq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129284,"logo_path":null,"name":"in-akustic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Larry Coryell: A Retrospective","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Coryell","original_name":"Larry Coryell","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":"/hqwEmlocluHigUEcRt9u7IIpulp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fc0c4e6742001d538717","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Coryell","original_name":"Julian Coryell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1Btb6o4GZcUd6ISQCtvofpqyW0Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fc3ad20c870023316246","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Valentine","original_name":"James Valentine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4QcuklhYVBLYGGf8NeL7hnT00OE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fc8397eab4001de18a94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hidalgo","original_name":"David Hidalgo","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/lw9eaQz1Esm1qnCogLtir5Y9lI3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fc9a590086001f51165c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winston Byrd","original_name":"Winston Byrd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ePWsq1CjXJKeVmeRpED0SpOAcDc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fcc0590086002151ef5b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hart","original_name":"John Hart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fcdc59008600204f8d06","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1477073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie","original_name":"Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fcf8590086002151ef81","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey Piergross","original_name":"Tracey Piergross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee3fd235b4fed0020629101","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2676420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamber Hepner","original_name":"Tamber Hepner","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee3fda5d20c870023316447","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPFSYvjWucvdtsuKLIGXRS34I1K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Q2vTasmbMlm9qaIjBXDDcKS8gq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Inglese\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"Inglese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
