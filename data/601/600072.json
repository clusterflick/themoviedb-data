Thomas Allen Harris, raised by activists in the Bronx and East Africa, produced a series of public television programs focused on HIV/AIDS, bringing folks who were previously ignored by mainstream media to the core of public discussion. Despite the program’s success in breaking open the narrative of the crisis, the pushback Harris received from the channel’s executives and constraints of corporate media ultimately led the artist to suspend work in public television. 28 years later, Harris draws from these resurfaced tapes and an essay he’d written at the time: “About Face: The Evolution of a Black Producer\". Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2017 as part of ALTERNATE ENDINGS, RADICAL BEGINNINGS, a program of seven videos prioritizing Black narratives within the ongoing AIDS epidemic curated by Erin Christovale and Vivian Crockett.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/yAZSRFgKqajhZD02PBoeHNitRWM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Face: The Evolution of a Black Producer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Allen Harris","original_name":"Thomas Allen Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cce3bd50e0a2627aafe4485","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Visual AIDS","original_name":"Visual AIDS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a195b0a70f2ad4498df3f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7476094","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yAZSRFgKqajhZD02PBoeHNitRWM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
