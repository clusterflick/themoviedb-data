But her American aviator boyfriend, Barry Blake (John Boles), is flying to her rescue. He does just that but, alas, they are quickly captured by a gang of outlaws. Possibly the many expensive pieces of jewelry she has gathered from the many male friends she has made along the way, including El Presidente, captured the outlaws' attention.","popularity":0.4808,"poster_path":"/5LqxQSg6Pngey4X94AOMON44s0Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virgin Lips","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Borden","original_name":"Olive Borden","popularity":0.2251,"profile_path":"/nEc6Jg7pGdIbXzcAZub6a6apIiE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Norma","credit_id":"5fc841deb2681f003d92ae72","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Boles","original_name":"John Boles","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":"/eVu8Tzdi3UYrCApUW221CSXoAHt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Barry Blake","credit_id":"5fc841e4383df2003e560e7d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Ruth","original_name":"Marshall Ruth","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/33ZAn0NsvwSu5V9kabcfIYF2Xmz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Slim","credit_id":"5fc841ec5f4b730042e4f1b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Gill","original_name":"Alexander Gill","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Garc√≠a","credit_id":"5fc84201680be800401623fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Alexander","original_name":"Richard Alexander","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/lRiIxz87P5YhfwargFYYzVV5frb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Carta","credit_id":"5fc8420e383df2003c56087e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2879500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erne Veo","original_name":"Erne Veo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"5fc8421bb0040a0040244b2c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Semels","original_name":"Harry Semels","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/7iCxFHAesyHDEM0susMJSCK8w40.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Patron","credit_id":"5fc842232811a1003ea03aab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arline Pretty","original_name":"Arline Pretty","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":"/9LzTHhxxcRwZBsPVlIVHGY7TNzU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Madge","credit_id":"5fc8422a383df2003f56194c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William H.
