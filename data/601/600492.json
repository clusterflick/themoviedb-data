Decades later, upon discovering the dwindling hamlet of Kandahar, Saskatchewan, he felt an immediate connection that needed to be explored. Abdul Bari Jamal's impulsive purchase of eight empty lots in the middle of the Canadian Prairies became an unexpected inheritance for his grown children. When the extended family of self-declared urbanites make their first trip together to witness their new property, Jamal's daughter takes the opportunity to document the unusual family vacation, hoping to unpack her father's relationship to his homeland and Canadian patriotism. What transpires on their journey is so much more than a humorous Green Acres collision of cultures-it's a heartfelt and moving conversation about two nations connected by conflict and how much of our identity is tied to the land we occupy.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/jKZEWadFUl25cUc1Gy1gPRetmF0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Kandahar Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2120510,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Max Armstrong","original_name":"Max Armstrong","popularity":0.0963,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60833324ffc9de0040673745","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486906,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Westheuser","original_name":"John Westheuser","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608333329e45860040c1c455","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aisha Jamal","original_name":"Aisha Jamal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd036079251410b622482e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1672448,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deborah Parks","original_name":"Deborah Parks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd0361a9251417df7248f18","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2143860,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Geoff Matheson","original_name":"Geoff Matheson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd036420e0a26225a013ca7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce Fowler","original_name":"Bruce Fowler","popularity":0.1552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd03635c3a368472dd933f1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aisha Jamal","original_name":"Aisha Jamal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd03612c3a3684fbcde78b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10285826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1545,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jKZEWadFUl25cUc1Gy1gPRetmF0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
