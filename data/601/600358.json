Dixie uses an employment agency to unknowingly land a job with Neil's attorney son, Bruce. A romance develops between the two until they go to meet the old man, who promptly forces Dixie to break up with Bruce because of her 'sordid' past. Bruce will have none of it, so to get him to drop her she attempts to get 'caught' in an innocent date with her employment agency contact, Haines. Unfortunately, Haines has different ideas about their encounter and will not take \"no\" for an answer so Dixie is forced to clock him with an urn, killing him. Dixie's trial for murder leads to a courtroom confrontation between father and son, with her fate resting in the balance.","popularity":0.236,"poster_path":"/l8E40peLTxKWaxxIGwUEWfm7ROi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1928-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Restless Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marceline Day","original_name":"Marceline Day","popularity":0.2173,"profile_path":"/nUgZ88hv2zvjJPvmVca7CxgXeGA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dixie","credit_id":"658fb00964f71666a28e820f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Forbes","original_name":"Ralph Forbes","popularity":0.2961,"profile_path":"/kSZ7qzRsQKLlLrNzvwwfsEWZc8B.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bruce Neil","credit_id":"658fb0151dcb776b8144a7be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Trevor","original_name":"Norman Trevor","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/4Nzo3ugMQDb2Hx5jbP3GJFRVzs1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"John Neil","credit_id":"658fb021e640d6027bd543aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29347,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Ellis","original_name":"Robert Ellis","popularity":0.2122,"profile_path":"/ecUP4Ja2FeuFZv9ADwuxs8uUHrs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Robert Haines","credit_id":"658fb02e41a56166da04557b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3327531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Maybery","original_name":"Mary Maybery","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Susan","credit_id":"658fb04064f716662d8e849b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Elliott","original_name":"Bill Elliott","popularity":0.2801,"profile_path":"/9Wafomp8j5p0CWnRXJWt6OlAg0m.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"George Baxter","credit_id":"658fb04e6aa8e06277ea83cd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coy Watson Jr.","original_name":"Coy Watson Jr.","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":"/cLYNjnX7IYqhYHndmrSk3TqWeBW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Office Boy","credit_id":"658fb0a464f71665808e8895","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","credit_id":"658fafde64f71665d68e8651","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103444,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Howard J.
