He starts a brawl, rescues Mary in the mêlée that follows, and then loses her when she flees to a hotel. He follows her and finds she is mixed up in some mysterious activity. However, he knows more about her than she does him (because he isn't what he is supposed to be - and she isn't, either), he stays close by, even to the point of using a machine-gun to dispel a mob at a Chinese temple.","popularity":0.1881,"poster_path":"/a77oy7b7wxiWIf9IDX6PQxXgkLl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Warning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Holt","original_name":"Jack Holt","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/4xfh3Mlpqx8tZ991rhVTov0ILtN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tom Fellows / Col.
