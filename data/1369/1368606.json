Exploring the social awkwardness of grief, and inspired by the writing of Anton Chekhov, the project gathers current and former artists of Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, as well as the Grotowski Institute-based physical theater company Teatr ZAR, as a reflection on the lineages of Polish Jerzy Grotowski and German Pina Bausch, their relationship and how their work resonates today. This particular piece features original company member and longtime collaborator of Pina Bausch, Josephine Ann Endicott, in poignant solo about aging, the passage of time, and nostalgia.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smile, Jo.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4870436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samantha Shay","original_name":"Samantha Shay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67067e62dc54f29d0eab6a96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
