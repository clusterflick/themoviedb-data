Connecting this cinematic collage is a remix of Mae West’s intensely sexualized version of a 1913 song by Black Canadian composer Shelton Brooks, from the film She Done Him Wrong (1933). Radically slowed, West’s mournful, sensual voice transforms loss and longing into a haunting stillness played out over oddities in the news.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/vNL6hwEjmb7vUWlnDwI5JBoqbiT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malfunctions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Anne Sando","original_name":"Julie Anne Sando","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706c309003c9214a0b3dedd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3037845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Bergeron","original_name":"Patrick Bergeron","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706c3198fb723a0b6e0afbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vNL6hwEjmb7vUWlnDwI5JBoqbiT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":636}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
