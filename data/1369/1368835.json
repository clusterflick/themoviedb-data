Through flashbacks and the sharing of memories, we witness the love story between Adrianna, a dedicated OSI agent, and her wife, Heather, as they navigate the challenges of military life under the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. Despite the constant fear of exposure, their bond grows stronger. Adrianna's eventual deployment to Afghanistan, where she serves with valor, ends tragically, leaving her family to grapple with the devastating news. The narrative captures the enduring love and strength that Adrianna instilled in her family, her commitment to her duty, and the bittersweet reality of their shared dreams cut short. The film closes with a reflection on the end of America's military involvement in Afghanistan, juxtaposing personal loss with historical milestones, and a message of gratitude and resilience for the future.","popularity":0.2544,"poster_path":"/yYIBY5TYGbjCMXmlRJqomOJGiAG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a poignant tale of love, loss, and resilience, a mother recounts her enduring bond with a dedicated military officer under the shadows of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" as they navigate life's challenges and the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan.","title":"In Honor of Adrianna: A Family's Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4992322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Lamb","original_name":"Heather Lamb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6708141b200b5388b5565483","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4992324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrianna Vorderbruggen","original_name":"Adrianna Vorderbruggen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Posthumously","credit_id":"6708144ec92c2e56d8617609","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caitlin \tWilliams","original_name":"Caitlin \tWilliams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67081234200b5388b55652b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caitlin \tWilliams","original_name":"Caitlin \tWilliams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67081247d0616c7b19fb8999","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
