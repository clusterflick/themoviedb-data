The film explores two landscapes, an industrial rock quarry turned recreational fossil hunting park, in which 380-million-year-old fossils were discovered beneath the rocks where once flowed a shallow sea, and a public waterway whose shore is dispersed with brightly colored fragments of consumer waste in the form of microplastics. Both landscapes reveal a process of digging and gathering, of collecting evidence of earth’s pre-historic past or intervening in humanity’s toxic futures. The forms, of ancient sea creatures and broken plastic, mesh and intertwine into a meditation on deep time and a reflection on extinction.","popularity":0.0694,"poster_path":"/zoDybYL5zncnUqQuQVjs3QP47Mm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landforms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Kraning","original_name":"Laura Kraning","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fe6Sxb19e7u2epztaasmskhFibk.jpg","credit_id":"6706a5bd7e3cee7d3f9cf352","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zoDybYL5zncnUqQuQVjs3QP47Mm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":636}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
