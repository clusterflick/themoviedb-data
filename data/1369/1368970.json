Aftermath documents UNRWAâ€™s response to the Six Day War in 1967, where Palestinian people were displaced and dispossessed yet again nearly 20 years after the Nakba in 1948. Aftermath reflects on the exodus as seen from Jordan, where refugees fled to. Though directed by Palestinian filmmaker Samir Hissen, it is notable that the film was written and produced by Myrtle Winter, a UN diplomat who worked in the Department of Public Information at UNRWA. Aftermath documents an emergency camp set up by the government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which, with the scale of displaced people, was continually short of tents. A recurring feature of relief agency films is that we do not hear Palestinian voices.","popularity":0.0624,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aftermath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Hissen","original_name":"Samir Hissen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67070514ede1413b85e54a7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991804,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robi Breedy","original_name":"Robi Breedy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c3f1308dd708bb96dee5c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991805,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Sturken","original_name":"Peter Sturken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c3f188bca661d05432538","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3461035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Lewes","original_name":"Henry Lewes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c3f49a915feb71064fe96","department":"Production","job":"Production Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991807,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Allen Hovey","original_name":"Allen Hovey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c3f5468e0d873636de493","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Salim Fakhoury","original_name":"Salim Fakhoury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c3f5f08dd708bb96dee73","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4504328,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Myrtle Winter Chaumeny","original_name":"Myrtle Winter Chaumeny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c3f6a5add61273d650432","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4504328,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Myrtle Winter Chaumeny","original_name":"Myrtle Winter Chaumeny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c3f6f08dd708bb96dee7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
