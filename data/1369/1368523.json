She is a dancer. Her body's impulses are generated in the moment from contact with different environments. Noora has congenital bone fragility, Osteogenesis Imperfecta. She uses a wheelchair as a dancing aid and in it, she can move widely, but feels isolated from the surrounding environment. She is searching ways to move, focusing on possibilities rather than on limitations. On the ground, she feels the ground against her skin. In the water she can let go of her wheelchair. Noora's toes sink into the mud bottom, which pulsates with her steps. The water supports her fragile body with its pressure and surrounded by it she dares to move more freely, her body is more elastic, her expressions and range of motion are greater.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4510738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Kekkonen","original_name":"Anna Kekkonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67065eac44265c4359782f39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
