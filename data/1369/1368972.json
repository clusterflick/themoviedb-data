Malvolia. Get ready for four all-new creepy and bizarre tales from some of the spookiest indie directors walking among the living. A cursed VHS tape finds itself in the hands of curious friends in “EjecDEAD” (Taylor & Matthew McManus of the ‘Slash-O-Lantern’ series), next a disgruntled candy maker has a diabolical plan for revenge in “Haig’s Heart” (Dylan R. Nix of ‘Demon of Serling’), then a group of contest winners get more than they bargained for in a haunted house in “The Witch’s Curse” (Dustin Ferguson of ‘Apex Preadator’) and finally a scary attraction employee becomes something really scary after being bitten by a werewolf in “Moonlight Massacre” (Ryan Sheets of ‘The Pumpkin Man’). Including coming attraction trailers from “Gravestalkers” (Zane Hershberger), and ”Shotgun Hooker” (Josh Graves of ‘Late Checkout’).","popularity":0.0935,"poster_path":"/5pqhALjDtFalIoiEy5U2wRJuY5E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10/31 Part 4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3675581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor McManus","original_name":"Taylor McManus","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/yYxExI54Gn2YlOclxDkJFYqd5Cs.jpg","credit_id":"6707066f5f3857993340e88f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3675584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew McManus","original_name":"Matthew McManus","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707067dc55ea6c6178c8989","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Sheets","original_name":"Ryan Sheets","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670706895f3857993340e899","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan R.
