Due to a lack of resources for trans people wanting to biologically conceive, Krishna has created a durational theatre show and through his on-stage interviews with strangers, he attempts to find the “perfect” sperm donor. The film unravels a compelling exploration of human connection and the unique dynamics of queer family-making.","popularity":0.0572,"poster_path":"/wB95p99KETuGOBeXz8LIl0UKsHd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sperm Donors Wanted!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2757852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krishna Istha","original_name":"Krishna Istha","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6706253244265c4359781b57","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Logan Rea","original_name":"Logan Rea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"670625387e3cee7d3f9cbf0f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Logan Rea","original_name":"Logan Rea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670624e87e3cee7d3f9cbedc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Logan Rea","original_name":"Logan Rea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670624f1dc54f29d0eab4dfe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2757852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krishna Istha","original_name":"Krishna Istha","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67062524003c9214a0b39ec0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31987575","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cz2HgihrGIxdybPt0j2g4OAT0oH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wB95p99KETuGOBeXz8LIl0UKsHd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Geelong Pride Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
