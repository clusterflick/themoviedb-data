Coalescing the past, present and future, the film weaves these stories around those of the Moonlight Tower, a short-lived 19th century lighting technology. The film’s day as night ambient audio track, visual shakiness and interruptive transitions are designed to create a slightly off-kilter viewing experience, echoing the widespread confusion or “nocturnal jet-lag” felt by much of the animal kingdom when darkness is lost or altered. Shot on 16mm, the film was hand-processed using homemade eco-reversal techniques that complemented the subject matter; from charcoal development to car headlight exposure. The film owes its very existence to that which it laments, the presence of unwanted and at times uncontrolled light.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jhkOtfkieqHlMujzzeC7vmm2eux.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waiting Up to Meet the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Carr","original_name":"Anthony Carr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67069697a88614d6b08afea1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jhkOtfkieqHlMujzzeC7vmm2eux.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":636}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
