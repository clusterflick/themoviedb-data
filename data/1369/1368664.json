But the memories that surface are another story. And these have to go. Sometimes you find yourself doing things that seem too familiar, things you swore you would never do. Maybe you feel compelled to break the cycle, to “stop the insanity,” as a friend calls it. Making The Box is part of that process for me. As such, it is a personal archive documentary dealing with memory, inter-generational trauma, grief and hope.","popularity":0.0582,"poster_path":"/ovVqTtB452wl24FWaFHA7VoD9nV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Box","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wvyETK9v84Nb6IjlCjDkE24KNCq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ovVqTtB452wl24FWaFHA7VoD9nV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
