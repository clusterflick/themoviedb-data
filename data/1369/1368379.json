A remote location nestled in the ‘Bass Strait Triangle’ (akin to The Bermuda Triangle). This stretch of land and water has recorded more disappearances of ships, aircraft, and individuals than any other area in Australia.1 What starts off as a personal reprieve from society slowly slips into a new form of remote paranoia. Amid his attempts to find inner peace within a new daily rhythm, the island's troubled history starts to manifest itself in strange and unsettling presences. These encounters appear to be orchestrated by an unseen, enigmatic intelligence, that deciphers parapsychological imprints using WiFi radio signals which gradually bleed into the protagonist's reality.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/UHmykeoV4sZEajhnTWNwt5NPOo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Know A Person When I Talk To It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2459269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanton Cornish-Ward","original_name":"Stanton Cornish-Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e051f4b919f83977a5d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989604,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stanton Cornish-Ward","original_name":"Stanton Cornish-Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e06e373b1be0e0e9e140","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989607,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Luke Neher","original_name":"Luke Neher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e09d0000000000586f19","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989608,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Luke Agiti","original_name":"Luke Agiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e0a7373b1be0e0e9e173","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989612,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chris Conn","original_name":"Chris Conn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e0b1373b1be0e0e9e17f","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989613,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeremy Eaton","original_name":"Jeremy Eaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e0bd0000000000586f31","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989616,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Katie Paine","original_name":"Katie Paine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e0ca0000000000586f47","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2190,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/UHmykeoV4sZEajhnTWNwt5NPOo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1460}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
