Determined to find love through dating apps, she instead stumbles into a series of chaotic side adventures that have nothing to do with romance. From absurd meet-ups to unexpected detours, Aira’s journey becomes less about finding “the one” and more about doing things “just for the plot.” In the end, she realizes that sometimes the real story isn’t about love at all—it’s about embracing the mess along the way.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":"/cyz2tSB9cSDOLE0cUCzXOj3ylWs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Croslin
