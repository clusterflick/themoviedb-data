Now the man, who has made a career writing about others, finds himself as a character in a story. Bhedako Oon Jasto, or Like Sheep's Wool, an hour long documentary, is named after the song he first heard in a highland village north of Kathmandu. It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune.
