The 5-year-old boys came to Dayton Children’s from Guatemala in July 2021 joined at the top of the head with a 90 degree turn, classified as craniopagus O’Connell class III.  The condition is incredibly rare with an estimated 50 craniopagus twins born every year, with only an estimated 15 of those surviving more than a few months.
