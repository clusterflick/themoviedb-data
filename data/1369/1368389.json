On board, eleven bodies were found by coastguards, preserved and sun-dried. The ghost ship had been drifting for four months on the Atlantic Ocean. The film presents an inadequate narrative of a story that relies on media sources to evoke the complicity of the weather, ocean currents, and state violence in the shipâ€™s journey. The glide between film and forms tests the measurement of tragedies related to crossings and immigration, highlighting the power of the sea and the horror of the figure of the ghost ship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oYPEKI4FY77CHDPoXFT6d2C4FGo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow of Our Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2720402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayesha Hameed","original_name":"Ayesha Hameed","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/n0Mdncl1DDfuht1Jh7BDe6ox4h1.jpg","credit_id":"6705e84c44265c4359780bb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamedine Kane","original_name":"Hamedine Kane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6705e85c7e3cee7d3f9cac3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2156,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oYPEKI4FY77CHDPoXFT6d2C4FGo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1437}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
