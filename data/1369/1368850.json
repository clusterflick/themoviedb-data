Just when he finds a fleeting sense of freedom, his return to addiction is abruptly derailed when all the doors that once were open to him suddenly slam shut. Overwhelmed by debt, he loses his apartment, and his depressed mother withdraws all support as a form of self-protection. He is lacking both money and drugs, and even his social worker, Stefan, only grudgingly allows him to stay overnight  — merely with the intent of returning him to rehab the next day. In search of escape, David dives into a night of excess that leads to a monumental blackout.","popularity":0.1255,"poster_path":"/37vWGqbOlKKnOxFCPzfcRXM9RVt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scattered Sunshine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3687877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lasse Claßen","original_name":"Lasse Claßen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"David","credit_id":"6706db40003c9214a0b3ea3e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Langner","original_name":"Jochen Langner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sozialarbeiter","credit_id":"6706db568fb723a0b6e0b905","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2898346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Dexl","original_name":"Doris Dexl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jll2tvTiZmBKp94d7B7XVV3d2at.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mutter","credit_id":"6706db65003c9214a0b3ea48","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Wellings","original_name":"Lars Wellings","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/xYGelJxMuvii2VwN5FSPGeyPn07.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Vater","credit_id":"6706db74003c9214a0b3ea5d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Zekarias","original_name":"Samuel Zekarias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Psychotherapeut","credit_id":"6706db9b44265c43597865b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3912777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lennart Hahn","original_name":"Lennart Hahn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jannis","credit_id":"6706dc008fb723a0b6e0b960","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heike Geltsch","original_name":"Heike Geltsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Freundin/Klinik","credit_id":"6706dc39003c9214a0b3ea97","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven Gey","original_name":"Sven Gey","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/xZmW0KKoir5xmjyMV2x1AkqUdCx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Arzt","credit_id":"6706dc4b8fb723a0b6e0b995","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3687874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Dülligen","original_name":"Lucas Dülligen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706db0b8fb723a0b6e0b8de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3687874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Dülligen","original_name":"Lucas Dülligen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706dd56c55ea6c6178c7d0d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990806,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Olk","original_name":"Simon Olk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706dd7bc55ea6c6178c7d3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/NnBaCI2enJqCiG103BgDflt2Sp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/37vWGqbOlKKnOxFCPzfcRXM9RVt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"58.
