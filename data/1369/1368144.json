I'd like to change the emphasis of what's important when looking at a woman.\"  Filmed in San Francisco in 2000, Margaret Kilgallen (1967-2001) discusses the female figures she incorporated into many of her paintings and graffiti tags. Loosely based on women she discovered while listening to folk records, watching buck dance videos, or reading about the history of swimming, Kilgallen painted her heroines to inspire others and to change how society looks at women. Three of Kilgallen's heroines—Matokie Slaughter, Algia Mae Hinton, and Fanny Durack—are shown and heard through archival  recordings. Kilgallen is shown tagging train cars with her husband, artist Barry McGee, in a Bay Area rail yard and painting in her studio at UC Berkeley (source: Art21).","popularity":0.2344,"poster_path":"/agRsikCeX4j6uJtL8wBwPOFWZ40.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I'd like to change the emphasis of what's important…when looking at a woman","title":"Margaret Kilgallen: Heroines","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Heroines","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988555,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Forster","original_name":"Ian Forster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670551dd2ae7eb9084c02214","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988556,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bob Elfstrom","original_name":"Bob Elfstrom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670552015454b8623369df84","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988555,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Forster","original_name":"Ian Forster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67055634ccbb4e7f1669dcd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/50uJ7ka7g4b5YsXlHVoivmkLikS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/agRsikCeX4j6uJtL8wBwPOFWZ40.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":387,"name":"california"},{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":176485,"name":"female artist"},{"id":226261,"name":"folk art"},{"id":256087,"name":"trains"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":288298,"name":"san francisco"},{"id":339179,"name":"female musician"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Margaret Kilgallen: Heroines | Art21 \"Extended Play\"","key":"kjJZ5sqVZkI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2013-03-08T17:59:10.000Z","id":"6705516f5ae01d090e1d5502"}]}}}
