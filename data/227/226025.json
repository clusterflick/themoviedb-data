Delia, their grand-daughter, was brought up by them. The three of them live together harmoniously in a cosy atmosphere. At the age of 27, she already has a promising career in a big company.\r Everything is turned upside down with Maga’s sudden death just at the moment when Delia is assigned a very responsible task, the management of a major project which may launch her carer or bring it to an inglorious end. And what’s  more to it, in the opening of the testament it turns out that Maga had expressed the wish that her ashes be dispersed in the Caribbean. Delia is facing a serious dilemma, as in her grand-father’s life there is nothing else now but the accomplishment of his companion’s last wish at a time when Delia can not abandon her professional commitment for a trip to the Caribbean.","popularity":0.1163,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":44518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miel y Palo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"}],"release_date":"2010-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Eyes Shut","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Sanabria","original_name":"Carol Sanabria","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Delia","credit_id":"52fe4e729251416c75156b99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211437,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paulo Soto","original_name":"Paulo Soto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gastón","credit_id":"52fe4e729251416c75156b9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Luis Zamora","original_name":"Carlos Luis Zamora","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gabo","credit_id":"52fe4e729251416c75156ba5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Porras","original_name":"Carlos Porras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Oficial de tránsito","credit_id":"5909a6729251411ce900bc25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César Maurel","original_name":"César Maurel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5909a67b9251411cde00c113","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anabelle Ulloa","original_name":"Anabelle Ulloa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Maga","credit_id":"5ea86dcc2d1e40002483cdaa","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751384,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jose Pablo García","original_name":"Jose Pablo García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6352c54a880c9200900ada71","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hernán Jiménez","original_name":"Hernán Jiménez","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/o5O7MAi2CJVcmaX9drSRhXfJOjO.jpg","credit_id":"5f64bbc4a0b690003931cf43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hernán Jiménez","original_name":"Hernán Jiménez","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/o5O7MAi2CJVcmaX9drSRhXfJOjO.jpg","credit_id":"5f64bbd9e33f830035f41ec4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1466427","wikidata_id":"Q24706339","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
