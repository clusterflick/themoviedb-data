Through artful documentation of Khari's history, daily life and with insight from psychiatric experts, \"Mars Project\" reveals the deep complexities of mental health and the inadequacies of the current Canadian healthcare system. Khari's diagnosis or spiritual encounters (as he refers to them) have entrenched themselves so deeply, that it will take much more than a state-imposed drug regimen or spiritual healing to vanquish his demons.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/27OUdzXMJXoPs3PZv1G6soD66DR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mars Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Addi 'Mindbender' Steward","original_name":"Addi 'Mindbender' Steward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e8b9251416c7515a0af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khari Stewart","original_name":"Khari Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself/Conspiracy","credit_id":"52fe4e8b9251416c7515a0b3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Balazs","original_name":"Jonathan Balazs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e8b9251416c7515a0ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2392128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/27OUdzXMJXoPs3PZv1G6soD66DR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
