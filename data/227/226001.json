As time is running out, the beast abducts the girl Elsa and takes her prisoner. He puts all his efforts into charming the girl. Elsa does not accept her fate, and the beast is not at all a gentleman with fine manners. The transformative power of love, which frees Elsa of her feelings of guilt towards her parents and which returns the beast to his former humanity, is at the heart of the film. Aimed at a family audience, the film's eerie scenes are balanced with humor and poetry.","popularity":0.8304,"poster_path":"/w7I8ZnzbJJiT07e8yU2OU1QlKiJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty and the Beast","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","title":"Kaunitar ja koletis","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Belle en het Beest","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Belle en het Beest","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Märchenperlen – Die Schöne und das Biest","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Beauty and the Beast","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximilian Simonischek","original_name":"Maximilian Simonischek","popularity":0.2649,"profile_path":"/7Oqa4RQJkdqxhwAgrWLrEpuAqSH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Arbo","credit_id":"52fe4e719251416c751569f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1180685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornelia Gröschel","original_name":"Cornelia Gröschel","popularity":0.3092,"profile_path":"/kRSa4HkRMydy0SFoBuZ74oX02TG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elsa","credit_id":"52fe4e719251416c751569fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürgen Tarrach","original_name":"Jürgen Tarrach","popularity":0.2034,"profile_path":"/jEmYDjiJTVCjzyCtT5kv5SLm1SZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Wirt Hugo, Elsas Vater","credit_id":"536242c50e0a2649ad0017cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Silberschneider","original_name":"Johannes Silberschneider","popularity":0.4217,"profile_path":"/lDkHRRpnGDtsk7zt48uq8jwUo4M.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pfandleiher","credit_id":"536242d50e0a2649b1001780","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Letkowski","original_name":"Christoph Letkowski","popularity":0.3995,"profile_path":"/xpyB4F3qyTaDehpgzSlgEQCAXoz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ritter Berthold von Rabenburg","credit_id":"55106b64c3a3681db200c277","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1444639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karsten Kramer","original_name":"Karsten Kramer","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/qx8a3BEpssrNurnJjrD6YMqDQY6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Wenzel","credit_id":"55106b8492514146a000cd0e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1444641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolin Walter","original_name":"Carolin Walter","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/cze4w41J46IQdJ1EAQRpEqoJQex.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Irmel","credit_id":"55106b9f9251414d31001046","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1313066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Wrietz","original_name":"Nadine Wrietz","popularity":0.2779,"profile_path":"/9S8P1ungQSbWxrhHPZMgeWgO6dJ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Magd Gertrud","credit_id":"55106bcec3a368487400e0e3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1444643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Edelmayer","original_name":"Wolfgang Edelmayer","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Vogt","credit_id":"55106be792514146a000cd19","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang S.
