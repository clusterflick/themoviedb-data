After the revolution, the new United States adopted a radically different economic system in which the government issued its own value-based money, so that private banks like the Bank of England were not siphoning off the wealth of the people through interest-bearing bank notes.  But bankers are nothing if not dedicated to their schemes to acquire your wealth, and know full well how easy it is to corrupt a nation's leaders.  Just one year after Mayer Amschel Rothschild had uttered his infamous \"Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws\", the bankers succeeded in setting up a new Private Central Bank called the First Bank of the United States, largely through the efforts of the Rothschild's chief US supporter, Alexander Hamilton.","popularity":0.1787,"poster_path":"/6o7ZdkWQAwvBafdZyTNiQdNrqKT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Wars are Bankers' Wars","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3717176,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Rivero","original_name":"Michael Rivero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63325c4e904f6d007f5174c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3717187,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zane Henry","original_name":"Zane Henry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63325e3bfcec2e0093596364","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10635880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9d1BALbY5vdngbImjQWSaTJxHy2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/akikWiwVvPuNhKoih19ZpScp9XF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6o7ZdkWQAwvBafdZyTNiQdNrqKT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kMehWOjqpcnIS10B0r0acTS97W5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ynevX5tpB28m72CtLisSfCJlH7v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3515,"name":"banker"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
