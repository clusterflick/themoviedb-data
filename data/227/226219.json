Documentary filmmaker Alex Luster delves into the minds and motivations behind some of Houston's most notorious guerilla street artists, capturing the lifespan of their art... conception, creation, placement and - ultimately - removal by the city's abatement enforcement. With commentary by legendary street artists and top local law enforcement officials, Stick 'Em Up! is a gritty, street-smart documentary that reveals the secret truth behind the prolific images you see every day - in cities all across the nation. Stick 'Em Up! was created by a team of talented Houston artists. A two-decade veteran of the Houston street art scene, GONZO247 worked as a Stick 'Em Up! producer and award-winning screenwriter Tony Reyes helped craft the story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2eHkjwxR9ssK0PHJecjvznnXs4E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the city is your gallery, the streets are your canvas... you better move quick!","title":"Stick 'Em Up!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1725157","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2eHkjwxR9ssK0PHJecjvznnXs4E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
