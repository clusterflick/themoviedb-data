Nikos and Alain, two male prostitutes and a female pimp, Monica, get tangled in a peculiar relationship after meeting in a dark street called POUTANA. They fall in love, play with guns and talk about card games, money and theatre castings. Is this a game of role playing the three of them have invented to pass their time in a remote, empty summer house? Have they been reading Jean Genet? Whether a mirror image of the characters’ reality or an elliptic depiction of their distorted, dream-like perception of it, I Afroditi Stin Avli, by juxtaposing disparate literary and art references, leads its isolated characters towards dissolution. And yet, in its strange language, it presents this dissolution as a triumph.","popularity":0.0593,"poster_path":"/xm1KI8uprY50UFCGAJyoqbgtY85.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chocolate Grinder Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venus in the Garden","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"I Afroditi stin avli","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Venus in the Garden","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Athina Mathiou","original_name":"Athina Mathiou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Monika","credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandros Vardaxoglou","original_name":"Αλέξανδρος Βαρδαξόγλου","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qcPBHOjh8ZCGjznIKQAR15RwFfR.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Nikos","credit_id":"620c6beefdf8b7001b065245","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stavros Svigos","original_name":"Σταύρος Σβήγκος","popularity":0.2756,"profile_path":"/hzXBtC3xfmu8xSLwMJj7f2IBrNh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alan","credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575db","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275902,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Assaf Hochman","original_name":"Assaf Hochman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telémachos Alexiou","original_name":"Telémachos Alexiou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275901,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tim Schenkl","original_name":"Tim Schenkl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575ed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telémachos Alexiou","original_name":"Telémachos Alexiou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275900,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilektra Kalaitzi","original_name":"Ilektra Kalaitzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telémachos Alexiou","original_name":"Telémachos Alexiou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telémachos Alexiou","original_name":"Telémachos Alexiou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e779251416c751575e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2091317","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xm1KI8uprY50UFCGAJyoqbgtY85.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mad2mpqSQy5TtqEdM3JrGvRbExQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"VENUS IN THE GARDEN (Η ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗ ΣΤΗΝ ΑΥΛΗ) 2011","key":"XDujXv-PhJk","published_at":"2011-10-11T00:21:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec71ec3a368544800b4b4"}]}}}
