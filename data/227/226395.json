Their father seems recently to have died. The mother leaves early and returns late, out on long walks in the park with a lover whom the daughter and her best friend try to spy on. The daughter pecks away at a computer at work and has a desultory affair with her married boss, which he carries on between his business and family phone calls. And the son breaks into cars and “recycles” the electronics he finds.","popularity":0.1532,"poster_path":"/fFAjFYDCggWmMLXR8d1SziHfi3Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33521,"logo_path":"/e306zQJWEbMegODEB0cRJHIfaLT.png","name":"Da Huang Pictures","origin_country":"MY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2012-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If It's Not Now, Then When?","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bee Hung Tan","original_name":"Bee Hung Tan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e7c9251416c7515804d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Gan","original_name":"Kenny Gan","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e7c9251416c75158051","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pearlly Chua","original_name":"Pearlly Chua","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/byIg0gksCaD7oou5smvQhVwzJxG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e7c9251416c75158055","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hui Yee Gan","original_name":"Hui Yee Gan","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e7c9251416c75158059","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bok Lai Loh","original_name":"Bok Lai Loh","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e7c9251416c7515805d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Lee","original_name":"James Lee","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/wJk5IChXodofMry0u3QqghLfafn.jpg","credit_id":"5464e449c3a36804a700219c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2587064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.747,"height":818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fFAjFYDCggWmMLXR8d1SziHfi3Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":611}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
