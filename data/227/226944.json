Jascha Heifetz was the first truly modern virtuoso, a man about whom Itzhak Perlman said, 'When I spoke with him, I can't believe, I'm talking to God'. Heifetz was a legendary but mysterious figure whose story embodies the dual nature of artistic genius. The paradox of how a mortal man lives with immortal gifts - gifts he must honor, but which extract a life-long price. Is the man and the artist the same person? What is the price each pays? And who was the man behind the music?","popularity":0.3091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jascha Heifetz: God's Fiddler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Rosen","original_name":"Peter Rosen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e8d9251416c7515a4b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1202964,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sara Lukinson","original_name":"Sara Lukinson","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e8d9251416c7515a4b9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1906381","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
