Since childhood, Ted Farrell has always loved listening to a good story and over the years became quite good at spinning some of his own. Being a radio drama student in college, Ted is learning that listening to those \"whispers in the dark\" is much more frightening when the \"whispers\" go unseen. To ace his class project and with his roommates on a 2-day vacation, Ted has the weekend to spin a bone-chilling tale on audio tape complete with spine tingling sound effects.","popularity":0.3933,"poster_path":"/9aOyXeB1RGxaIseGWx0XWOpxRSh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
