In these remote places, civilization constantly fights and embraces nature and its timeless rules and rites. People, animals and nature become elements of a millennial existence cycle where physical and mental endurance are as important as chance and where life and death constantly meet each other.","popularity":0.095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223587,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Saulius Lukoševičius","original_name":"Saulius Lukoševičius","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/eSyvyWRiHRgw25kPPgIVrCZNa0Z.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e8d9251416c7515a46f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristina Picchi","original_name":"Cristina Picchi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e8d9251416c7515a469","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2016907,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanya Petrik","original_name":"Tanya Petrik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/AbXtm7sWCjyiTurEHoSdyKIUvh8.jpg","credit_id":"5ac71bd10e0a264977022161","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2879772","wikidata_id":"Q83885392","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
