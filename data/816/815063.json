His next big plan is to bring more romance into his parents’ relationship who seem to squabble non-stop. He finds out they were once happy, in a remote natural reserve, Bear Park. Surely returning there would fix their romance! That’s why Bertie urgently needs to win the inter-school skiing race with a prize trip to Bear Park. But Bertie has no talent for sports. Plus it's a relay competition for teams, and he is not very good at making friends either. Luckily Bertie bumps into Milly, an orphan – and a bear. Bertie helps Milly hide and finds out that she is superior in skiing. Could Milly take Bertie’s place in the competition?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pyjama Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Bear Park","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leena Jääskeläinen","original_name":"Leena Jääskeläinen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606dab49ad59b5006e2443cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3041866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaisa Penttilä","original_name":"Kaisa Penttilä","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606dab56ad87f70057eea050","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3041866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaisa Penttilä","original_name":"Kaisa Penttilä","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606dab5a1cc4ff005820c444","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leena Jääskeläinen","original_name":"Leena Jääskeläinen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606dab39e04aca0079fd033f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
