Entranced by his charm, Lucie soon discovers that the young man is, in fact, the devil in disguise. Under his influence, she signs a pact and becomes a \"Macrale\"—a witch endowed with dark powers in the Walloon tradition.  At first, Lucie revels in her newfound abilities, intoxicated by the freedom and strength they bring. However, her initial excitement quickly turns to despair as her dream transforms into a nightmare. Bound by the devil's pact and alienated from her family and friends, Lucie must use her cunning and determination to fight for her freedom and reclaim her place in the world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":152238,"logo_path":"/asq3ny2PPCcQOS0pxJhAgI5Ihht.png","name":"Altitude100","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":13351,"logo_path":"/3cHYz3iUqBAnQfPh8LQnEaWSh1w.png","name":"Melusine Productions","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Lucie's Frightful Adventures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292187,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stéphan Roelants","original_name":"Stéphan Roelants","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/qKkzndmaNcfEUYX485a1mb7Oqg6.jpg","credit_id":"606dafa89ca75900409dbfac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benoit Feroumont","original_name":"Benoit Feroumont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606daf5912c6040040c8cb6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillaume Malandrin","original_name":"Guillaume Malandrin","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606daf73e1ad79006ea991f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benoit Feroumont","original_name":"Benoit Feroumont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606daf641c6aa70042140e81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBR3JKUjP3k9h5aGFnIP83hlhfu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
