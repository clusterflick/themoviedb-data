Interviews with lovers, family and friends--including some of the most important people in Israeli cinema--tell the gripping story of a strikingly handsome, charismatic and deeply passionate gay man who has become a revered cult figure in Israeli cinema.Interviews with the late filmmaker and fascinating footage of him on the set convey the same passion that comes through in scenes from his films, lovingly selected by documentarian Ran Kotzer. Like Fellini, Guttman transformed his dreams and everyday conversations with friends and family into integral parts of his pictures. He is most remarkable for his striking and original use of the frame. Every shot is a treasure. Amos Guttman dared to portray subjects that were taboo in his society, and his search for the right of individual expression is the connecting link of his works.","popularity":0.1802,"poster_path":"/iS9lAx194rrr7o0s9UbNNQGMYMr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frameline","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amos Guttman: Filmmaker","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Amos Guttman","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Amos Guttman, Film Director","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816468,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Doron Nesher","original_name":"Doron Nesher","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self -
