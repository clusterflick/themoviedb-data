The town and its surrounding area are made for vacationing. This documentary from 1989 also shows the other side, like, for example, how the increasing population density and the industrial production influence the ecological balance of the region. A community for the protection of the Bodden landscape is actively making an effort for conservation. At the institute for deep-sea fishery, research about the fish population is conducted, and agriculture as well is looking for solutions to preserve an intact environment.","popularity":0.2552,"poster_path":"/5ouA3kojr6BF1YXs9CQrolkZQJM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ribnitz-Damgarten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Meincke","original_name":"Ernst Meincke","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"606db2dbad59b50058bbabe3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfons Machalz","original_name":"Alfons Machalz","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606db28c1cc4ff00403ca346","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfons Machalz","original_name":"Alfons Machalz","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606db2851c6aa7006eb1913b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Schulze","original_name":"Klaus Schulze","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606db2a1e04aca002ae866b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473911,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Blach","original_name":"Rita Blach","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606db2bce1ad79002961df25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jens Scherer","original_name":"Jens Scherer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61faae68eee18600cd3b7554","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168984,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steffen Günther","original_name":"Steffen Günther","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61faae3f9e4012006f4d07c7","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2287147,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brigitte Unterdörfer","original_name":"Brigitte Unterdörfer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61faae4fdfaae9009c54d949","department":"Sound","job":"Music Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409389,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bernd Merten","original_name":"Bernd Merten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61faae1ffe6c1800c209001b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14510646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ouA3kojr6BF1YXs9CQrolkZQJM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":178026,"name":"environmental conservation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
