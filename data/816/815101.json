In one part of Kettle’s Yard Alfred Wallis Rediscovered is installed and in another part of the gallery, Wood’s film. How do they relate to one another? How does art enable connection?  The answer was Correspondence ­– a short essay film constructed from archive footage taken around the Cornish coastline. Correspondence speaks across time to fellow artist Alfred Wallis about the role the site of art plays in a time of social isolation.  The scripted voiceover in the new film takes the form of a letter written by Wood to Wallis.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/2GryC2c7k9i1GTDW3EmUksvIzzn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film made in correspondence with the painter Alfred Wallis","title":"Correspondence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Wood","original_name":"Sarah Wood","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"606dc58aad87f70040316f49","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Wood","original_name":"Sarah Wood","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606dc578ad59b50058bbc184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2GryC2c7k9i1GTDW3EmUksvIzzn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
