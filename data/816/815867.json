So he must remain in the town until he is healed. Meanwhile, in order not to get bored, he decides to sow terror among its inhabitants. As the days go by, the strange being that is none other than the fearsome \"CHUPACABRAS\" realizes that the only thing that inspires them is laughter. El Chupacabra discovers to his horror that he fell into a town of madmen, who led by the \"dangerous\" Sheriff (Manuel \"Flaco\" Ibañez) undertake persecution against him. The Chupacabra escapes to a nearby ranch where he kidnaps ¨La Paty¨ (Paty Muñoz) the owner's daughter, unleashing the wrath of ¨Condorito¨ a lepero and mischievous altar boy (Paty's boyfriend) who joins the crazy chase.","popularity":0.4435,"poster_path":"/uhsYyFFc4eTg0jcG5QGUzbz4Fzf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1997-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chupacabra Returns: The Altar Boy Against the Chupacabra","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel 'Flaco' Ibáñez","original_name":"Manuel 'Flaco' Ibáñez","popularity":0.3058,"profile_path":"/rBJnQ0FrST8ffs9yMxiQaPbmW6G.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"64dfef3f076ce8011d14f589","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo de Alvarado 'Condorito'","original_name":"Guillermo de Alvarado 'Condorito'","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Monaguillo","credit_id":"64dfef60d100b614b15af3b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Muñoz","original_name":"Patricia Muñoz","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/pvo7aQUD6VdFLhHmUmthq5SLT1d.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"La Paty","credit_id":"64dfef80076ce800adce1acb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637467,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gabriel Godínez","original_name":"Gabriel Godínez","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Chupacabra","credit_id":"64dfef98076ce8013a294b22","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Martínez hijo","original_name":"Arturo Martínez hijo","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfeef5aaec7103f7e39771","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854619,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heber Jiménez","original_name":"Heber Jiménez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfef1c076ce8011d14f57e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":956051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Vera","original_name":"José Luis Vera","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfef08b77d4b1141f97ce2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480568,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Delfino López","original_name":"Delfino López","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfeedee19de900c68b40f3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1863427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fina Coronado","original_name":"Fina Coronado","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfeecab77d4b11425fc69f","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1785039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Martínez","original_name":"Eduardo Martínez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bff5b923be46007cb9f193","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alonso O.
