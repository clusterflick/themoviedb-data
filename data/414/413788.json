It follows one woman's footsteps through the streets of her native city, on a journey of recovery from a bad thing that happened to her exactly one year before. It's an exploration of grief, identity and the power of architecture and urbanism to shape lives, and a celebration of the power of walking and looking to make us all feel just a little bit better. With new music by Neneh Cherry, old music by Benny Andersson (of ABBA) and Franz Berwald, and images by Christopher Doyle and Mark Cousins.","popularity":0.6074,"poster_path":"/ceVENAmHyfMtMyKtovHTZZvB0Ln.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82299,"logo_path":null,"name":"BofA Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Migma Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stockholm, My Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.667,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"stockholmmylove","type":"On-screen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neneh Cherry","original_name":"Neneh Cherry","popularity":0.1133,"profile_path":"/v4c6tg4kVEHcsd3h8ulK5AOfTkU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alva","credit_id":"57ca946f925141278a004436","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Cousins","original_name":"Mark Cousins","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/f5B9kcpJXLETRYwRZJmvKmiWfLu.jpg","credit_id":"57ca94409251411a99001b04","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Cousins","original_name":"Mark Cousins","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/f5B9kcpJXLETRYwRZJmvKmiWfLu.jpg","credit_id":"57ca9435925141357d0011ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76327,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anita Oxburgh","original_name":"Anita Oxburgh","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fde10e9251410900005208","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693336,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Dawtrey","original_name":"Adam Dawtrey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fdee959251411507001694","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neneh Cherry","original_name":"Neneh Cherry","popularity":0.1133,"profile_path":"/v4c6tg4kVEHcsd3h8ulK5AOfTkU.jpg","credit_id":"57fdefdf92514114b3001702","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475037,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Timo Langer","original_name":"Timo Langer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fdeeacc3a368504a00158a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1693335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary Bell","original_name":"Mary Bell","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fdee75c3a36850ac0016b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christopher Doyle","original_name":"Christopher Doyle","popularity":0.3773,"profile_path":"/dm2g37ak1EzIu1YViAwvZAvytlx.jpg","credit_id":"57fde0ecc3a3685285000d7b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Cousins","original_name":"Mark Cousins","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/f5B9kcpJXLETRYwRZJmvKmiWfLu.jpg","credit_id":"597a26bc92514107d6019959","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Cousins","original_name":"Mark Cousins","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/f5B9kcpJXLETRYwRZJmvKmiWfLu.jpg","credit_id":"597a2694c3a36867fd01b0d5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859102,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franz Berwald","original_name":"Franz Berwald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597a27059251410804017551","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76327,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anita Oxburgh","original_name":"Anita Oxburgh","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597a26c5c3a368688e01a5e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859101,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephen C.
