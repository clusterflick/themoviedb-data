Mrs. Hardluck has a wealth of hair, but no decorative comb for her hair. What is worse, finances are low, or rather exhausted. An idea strikes Hardluck. He will pawn his watch and buy a comb; thus surprising her. Mrs. Hardluck's mind is also illumined by a bright thought. She will sacrifice her hair, and with the money buy him a fob. This they do, of course, unknown to each other. Well, here's the situation: He had no fob for his watch, and she no comb for her hair; but now he has no watch for his fob, and she has no hair for her comb.  Mack Sennett appears as an extra in this film produced by the Biograph Company.","popularity":0.6026,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1909-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sacrifice","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Solter","original_name":"Harry Solter","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/2HWWlgqD4xYKZNwiSaD2BqPyAY2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Hardluck","credit_id":"57c3962ac3a36832e200245d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Lawrence","original_name":"Florence Lawrence","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":"/gpjntjA0Kbit4MUcPMM4KBLicpw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Hardluck","credit_id":"57c396339251412861002d2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Arvidson","original_name":"Linda Arvidson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pxNBQP2W90PyV69sjH3CRvXL2O4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"At Wigmaker's","credit_id":"57c3963ec3a36832ac002037","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John R.
