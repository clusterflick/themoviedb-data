Critically-acclaimed Linkous had a dramatic life that saw him battle with drug and alcohol addiction, paralysis, and debilitating depression that resulted in his eventual suicide.  Mark's music was heralded by his peers and critics; a mix of delicate pop, discordant punk and melodic odyssey; it has been described as defiantly surrealist with all manner of references to smiling babies, organ music, birds, and celestial bodies.  The film mines Marks life and music and navigates the sacrifices and highs and lows of his art.","popularity":1.0409,"poster_path":"/bCx5KMcHu5H1GMeQX60CpVfkw48.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bo-Ho Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The tragic tale of Mark Linkous, one of America's most influential cult artists.
