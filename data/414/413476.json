Even when offered a job at a restaurant in Melbourne, he declines using his father as the excuse.  When tragedy strikes, the only glimmer of joy arrives in the form of Olivia, a spirited Australian chasing her dream of working in design while on a family mission in Udine. Against the stunning vineyards, rugged mountains and blue Adriatic of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, these two very different people find themselves at a crossroads that will change their lives forever.","popularity":0.6636,"poster_path":"/tvRc8WR3NHylhgVW6a1jK5akLz6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8904,"logo_path":"/4IvWDPpPklykgC4CdlysDN3CEGv.png","name":"ideaCinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":95815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondo
