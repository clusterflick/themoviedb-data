Harry is in constant pain due to the bullet lodged near his spine, but he works off and on as a private detective to supplement his pension. Late one night, Harry is approached in his home by one of the men who shot him (Martin Sheen) to help find the other man (Sal Mineo) involved in the robbery, who he says is trying to kill him. Is it a setup?  This was the first pilot for the ABC detective series *Harry O*, which (after a second pilot, *Smile Jenny, You're Dead*, was picked up) aired from September 1974 to April 1976.","popularity":1.2574,"poster_path":"/j5VWQq7Ul8c6e1VzK6bA0SwBgcO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Such Dust as Dreams Are Made On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Janssen","original_name":"David Janssen","popularity":0.699,"profile_path":"/jCINgUrQcyV7w3C1LSg81Io2QEX.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Harry Orwell","credit_id":"57c4866d925141132f000617","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheen","original_name":"Martin Sheen","popularity":1.2177,"profile_path":"/m2Y3Q0uyuW6htrn2W9UWCWMkpZu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harlan Garrison","credit_id":"57c48687c3a36876080006ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sal Mineo","original_name":"Sal Mineo","popularity":0.8358,"profile_path":"/glfs6BXlFIMprrJSuiT74VzJIOJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Walter Scheerer","credit_id":"57c4869b92514112fa000672","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Kidder","original_name":"Margot Kidder","popularity":1.2484,"profile_path":"/bqFP3Tnd40ff9GzaBzqfNxWZkFq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"57c486afc3a36876730006f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Geer","original_name":"Will Geer","popularity":0.448,"profile_path":"/lpiuWaZxn0dov4FoYE6fxtsee8c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Len McNeil","credit_id":"57c486c192514112fa000680","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianna Hill","original_name":"Marianna Hill","popularity":0.5519,"profile_path":"/2Exz1SqtPkbM0EkkAKOk6I5OTg6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mildred","credit_id":"57c486d49251416c04005b67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Lloyd","original_name":"Kathleen Lloyd","popularity":0.8741,"profile_path":"/1ltrA2vLvG6et8iRIqxuCY7pnyj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marilyn Bedestrum","credit_id":"57c486e7925141132f000647","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Ladd","original_name":"Cheryl Ladd","popularity":1.4948,"profile_path":"/4GhTeSfWf4yGCbUWNdtS52kKiG3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57c486efc3a3681f3f00662c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Lannom","original_name":"Les Lannom","popularity":0.4389,"profile_path":"/v04CRgosOP6nJiyL3ihJ6YRUvXZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"57c486f89251416c04005b71","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059520,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack Woolf","original_name":"Jack Woolf","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c48776c3a36876080006f6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Lang","original_name":"Richard Lang","popularity":0.1707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c4875692514105810057d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Thorpe","original_name":"Jerry Thorpe","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/40RuKXEpWtMrQMXzV5KH9X8fQiq.jpg","credit_id":"57c4873692514112fa00069f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Thorpe","original_name":"Jerry Thorpe","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/40RuKXEpWtMrQMXzV5KH9X8fQiq.jpg","credit_id":"57c48721c3a3687673000722","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65151,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Howard A.
