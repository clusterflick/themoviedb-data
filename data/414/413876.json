Teen-age Annie and her father Luke are about to gather with friends for an annual game of Capture the Flag. This year, a lot more is at stake than the white T-shirt standing in for the flag. Annie's parents are on the verge of divorce, and this is the first time she and her father are participating without Annie's mother. What starts as a joyous reunion soon breaks down as friendships among the adults fracture and new allegiances among the children are formed. Over the course of this weekend, Annie learns that even though some things change, the most important relationships will somehow endure.","popularity":0.5971,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capture the Flag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Stiles","original_name":"Jane Stiles","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/dswGioW0JuRLk6fYZt8IDq4OXfi.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Annie Edwards","credit_id":"5ba912619251412f0104d678","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Cohen","original_name":"Scott Cohen","popularity":0.9447,"profile_path":"/xzm9EQQ4R62V2z2I2UagOuYGa9Y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luke Edwards","credit_id":"57ca6816c3a3685a530009c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Denton","original_name":"Will Denton","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/o3C3fpbtg3j65Nnl8SYiYwRLwzj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Justin Mason","credit_id":"57ca68239251411ac50007c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":200989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmy Clarke","original_name":"Emmy Clarke","popularity":0.918,"profile_path":"/Ad3xuMDJ7RQCQOAf4plh16S2Swp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Liz Shanlick","credit_id":"57ca6830c3a36806050000af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Black","original_name":"Kevin Black","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Peter Shanlick","credit_id":"57ca683c9251413514000103","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":161847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Egolf","original_name":"Gretchen Egolf","popularity":0.4809,"profile_path":"/q5Uu9b3RavVcoJJcZoYvZb0CTaH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Elise","credit_id":"57ca68459251413514000107","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1345418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Kirke","original_name":"Lola Kirke","popularity":0.6931,"profile_path":"/xXEBb9OoET7SgtkSmh1XtMs5YKC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tessa Shanlick","credit_id":"57ca6850925141359c0000c4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1231456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rebecca Chace","original_name":"Rebecca Chace","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/inaTAKr0qaH7XNAppnUaTovHzzm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Janis Mason-Shanlick","credit_id":"57ca685cc3a36872730003c2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1231456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rebecca Chace","original_name":"Rebecca Chace","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/inaTAKr0qaH7XNAppnUaTovHzzm.jpg","credit_id":"57ca6876925141359c0000d5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisanne Skyler","original_name":"Lisanne Skyler","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/9WTxKWQ4OXu1iHqHQGADFMRWaHW.jpg","credit_id":"57ca67d5925141357d0000a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisanne Skyler","original_name":"Lisanne Skyler","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/9WTxKWQ4OXu1iHqHQGADFMRWaHW.jpg","credit_id":"57ca6881c3a36872730003d3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1719010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
