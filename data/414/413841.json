With the help of his older brother, Jeyson, he composes and records songs about his life, their neighbourhood, and his dreams for the future. In this intimate documentary, director Yanillys Pérez highlights the resilience and dynamism of Jeffrey as he looks for customers, tries to avoid turf wars with other windshield washers, spends time at home with his family, and climbs his special tree. Full of dynamic music and dance sequences, Jeffrey captures a real-life story of a boy trying his best to turn his dreams into reality.","popularity":0.129,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeffrey","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1158823,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathilde Van de Moortel","original_name":"Mathilde Van de Moortel","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/aXwYs5YtGDjdWFopOBtw8uuIHJL.jpg","credit_id":"57dd71d8c3a368141f0003ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1447733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yanillys Pérez","original_name":"Yanillys Pérez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dd71cd925141784700043e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1680732,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabelle Julien","original_name":"Isabelle Julien","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dd71b3925141785d00043d","department":"Crew","job":"Digital Effects Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Goinard","original_name":"Olivier Goinard","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/cN6lOlCrk1LQpcuSG7pbgHNOxwh.jpg","credit_id":"57dd71e4925141785d000454","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thibaud Billiard","original_name":"Thibaud Billiard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dd71c19251417847000432","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1680735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juliette Heintz","original_name":"Juliette Heintz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dd71ed925141784a00046b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1447733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yanillys Pérez","original_name":"Yanillys Pérez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ca34979251412795001df6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5691550","wikidata_id":"Q26884489","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"JEFFREY Trailer | Festival 2016","key":"fTjD4Fke9T0","published_at":"2016-08-23T13:27:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5989fe11c3a36874f201aa22"}]}}}
