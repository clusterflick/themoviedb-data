The new laws are enforced by the security department of the Spectrum corporation, a huge conglomerate of the five biggest companies in the world. A voyeuristic filmmaker falls in love with an underground spoken word artist. As they find themselves unable to talk to one another, they start to make small films and write letters to one another. As the poet speaks out against Spectrum, and its owners, their lives become in danger. Will they be able to save each other in time?","popularity":0.0969,"poster_path":"/95d2vbJrFsdSLZuepGfDraOOLoX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Blundell","original_name":"Liam Blundell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"57cb2b5d92514163dd001bf7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki McClusky","original_name":"Nikki McClusky","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mandy","credit_id":"57cb2b6f925141643e001c1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Cromwell","original_name":"Charles Cromwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"James","credit_id":"57cb2b8bc3a3685c25005577","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Bridger","original_name":"Tom Bridger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Doc","credit_id":"57cb2c52c3a3680608004d3c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Woodgates","original_name":"Shaun Woodgates","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"57cb2c65925141359c004ba6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Smith","original_name":"Rob Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lindsay Ruddock","credit_id":"57cb2c79925141640f001c5f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674047,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Henry","original_name":"Michael Henry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"57cb2c88925141640f001c6b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Smith","original_name":"Marc Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Shy Drager","credit_id":"57cb2cc0c3a3685a5300568d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reid Drummond","original_name":"Reid Drummond","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Batten","credit_id":"57cb2cd0c3a3687273004da2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Brown","original_name":"Dan Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Von Hippel-Lindau","credit_id":"57cb2cef925141640f001c9a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bonner-MacKenzie","original_name":"Michael Bonner-MacKenzie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Enceph","credit_id":"57cb2d1292514163d0001bdd","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonny Gillard","original_name":"Jonny Gillard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Newscaster","credit_id":"57cb2d23925141357d004ef8","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Jackson","original_name":"James Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Technician","credit_id":"57cb2d44c3a3680608004d9c","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674080,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nathan T.
