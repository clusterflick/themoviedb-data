The story takes place in the quietness of a vacant ice rink during a late night, after hours, practice session where Tyler rehearses her current skating program. On the evening of our story we witness their improbable and ironic relationship. What these two share by story's end reminds us of the power of imagination and delivers an unexpected message of hope.","popularity":0.3726,"poster_path":"/kkIVcjvdRhzYn4mzKKGwJxLQZip.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zamboni Man","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Shannon","original_name":"Michael Shannon","popularity":1.9638,"profile_path":"/6mMczfjM8CiS1WuBOgo5Xom1TcR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Walt","credit_id":"57cb3de592514163cd002687","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1218584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatiana Totmianina","original_name":"Татьяна Тотьмянина","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/p9S1uY4pp1J45AS5omGr1mF2B5z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tyler","credit_id":"57cb3ded92514163dd002436","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Henrikson","original_name":"Seth Henrikson","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cb3dd6c3a3686744002393","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Henrikson","original_name":"Seth Henrikson","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cb3dd0c3a3685a53005ea3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2891579,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carrie Griffin Boyd","original_name":"Carrie Griffin Boyd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd59504091e62003e5a463e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Tweedy","original_name":"Jeff Tweedy","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/oCkl5DHGRN5R748lzbzd7DuSR3c.jpg","credit_id":"5fd594db28723c0043a1b409","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2891577,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Cafaro","original_name":"Jon Cafaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd594be60b58d003f843a6a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Henrikson","original_name":"Seth Henrikson","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd594cc8c40f700422c9d26","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2891578,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Segich","original_name":"Chris Segich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd594f607291c0043735f0d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Henrikson","original_name":"Seth Henrikson","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd594e8ecc7e8003fd3826c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0398402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kkIVcjvdRhzYn4mzKKGwJxLQZip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
