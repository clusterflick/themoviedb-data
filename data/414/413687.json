They have no children. When Hagar, a young horn player from East Jerusalem joins the Orchestra, Sarah's world erupts. A unique friendship evolves between the two women. Hagar, feeling Sarah’s pain from not having children, offers to have a baby for Sarah. Ismail, born to Hagar and Abraham, is a wild and gifted pianist whom Sarah raises as her own. When Ismail discovers the true identity of his mother, his world – and that of those around him – falls apart. Harmonia maintains the unique essence of the biblical story from Genesis and adds a personal and human perspective.","popularity":0.4331,"poster_path":"/dHjR2pD6iyCgpr7vXJCp356URYg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inosan Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harmonia","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tali Sharon","original_name":"טלי שרון","popularity":0.2388,"profile_path":"/ajAWdqROkqN5W8uZ3B5NxIDlTCk.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57c8ae55c3a3685bf80008fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alon Aboutboul","original_name":"Alon Aboutboul","popularity":0.7187,"profile_path":"/ja0vix3b43U5whDTYZascbeXlQo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57c8ae69c3a3685bf8000909","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yana Yossef","original_name":"Yana Yossef","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57c8ae86c3a3685bfc00080f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Suliman","original_name":"Ali Suliman","popularity":1.2847,"profile_path":"/r3ttMoDhWFrKzQ5QJzfHCUPg1pW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57c8ae8f92514148ec000918","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itai Shcherback","original_name":"Itai Shcherback","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57c8ae98c3a3685c020008d6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamir Tavor","original_name":"Tamir Tavor","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57c8aea192514148de0008d3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673219,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ofer Shabi","original_name":"Ofer Shabi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c8af1a92514148ec000959","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ori Sivan","original_name":"Ori Sivan","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/wpp0ZBd3oWz3pBT8kSRgdDsuUh9.jpg","credit_id":"57c8aeb892514148e70008bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673218,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yaniv Fridel","original_name":"Yaniv Fridel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c8af0092514148ee00080b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aviv Aldema","original_name":"Aviv Aldema","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c8aeef92514148e00008fe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ori Sivan","original_name":"Ori Sivan","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/wpp0ZBd3oWz3pBT8kSRgdDsuUh9.jpg","credit_id":"57c8aec892514148ee0007f3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mosh Danon","original_name":"Mosh Danon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c8aed4c3a3685be9000969","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673220,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ayelet Gil-Efrat","original_name":"Ayelet Gil-Efrat","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c8af2e92514148f30008d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51085,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaron Scharf","original_name":"Yaron Scharf","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581b893bc3a368695e0019ea","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5143744","wikidata_id":"Q52837222","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/dHjR2pD6iyCgpr7vXJCp356URYg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1713,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/4pQtYD0VnbsDVKzbucUBrDtp2OD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jerusalem Film Festival","release_date":"2016-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
