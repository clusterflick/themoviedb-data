If he finds it, he and his wife, Jeannine, will be able to complete an exhibition about the early stages of his career. This search becomes more than an opportunity to revisit the early influences on his art. During this exploration, he is confronted with a chapter of his youth that marked him for the rest of his life, and defined him as a human being and as a creator. The search for the lost painting, EL VENDEDOR DE ORQUÍDEAS (THE ORCHID SELLER), allows us to discover the human side of one of the most influential artists of Latin America.","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":"/4lp7uZx7bYjEfnVmGyokH5lUE0F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17116,"logo_path":null,"name":"TEOREMA","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":80973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malandro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2016-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Orchid Seller","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oswaldo Vigas","original_name":"Oswaldo Vigas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57c942b5c3a3687ca90002c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannine Castes Vigas","original_name":"Jeannine Castes Vigas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57c942bf92514125890002f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herman Vigas","original_name":"Herman Vigas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57c942c8c3a3687c440002a7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorenzo Vigas","original_name":"Lorenzo Vigas","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/fLOpnzSAXFTHuMgnB4n51kmJb8F.jpg","credit_id":"57c196829251414a07003433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4lp7uZx7bYjEfnVmGyokH5lUE0F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":843}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
