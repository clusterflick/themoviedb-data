The doctor's older, wiser supervisor, Dr. Clem Driscoll (George Bancroft), tries to curb Norris' impatience, pointing out that nothing takes place overnight. Angrily, Norris accuses Driscoll of malpractice and is forced to resign from the clinic -- just when a meningitis epidemic breaks out.","popularity":0.8337,"poster_path":"/vF3nWK9dxaKCLEBKrkcfDxsoGh4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Thrilling love story that unlocks the secrets of a big hospital!","title":"A Doctor's Diary","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Bancroft","original_name":"George Bancroft","popularity":0.2214,"profile_path":"/4OcexFu2DjuXvyoFe3RvnOESHlE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Clem Driscoll","credit_id":"57c1c2f69251413f7400a01a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Burgess","original_name":"Helen Burgess","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/s41vGYOPJXkkYos4TO4sSNzu8mh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ruth Hanlon","credit_id":"57c1c302c3a3685334005b44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Trent","original_name":"John Trent","popularity":0.1992,"profile_path":"/c0NiCGUCLJcQSiVS92uMo1LmdLz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Dan Norris","credit_id":"57c1c31c9251413ac600597e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Coleman","original_name":"Ruth Coleman","popularity":0.209,"profile_path":"/lALtd2xOEevQCvIiPknOkxkEc7L.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Catherine Stanwood","credit_id":"57c1c3299251413ac6005984","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102721,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ronald Sinclair","original_name":"Ronald Sinclair","popularity":0.1825,"profile_path":"/5K1E9TArCknVZlnHBXB0m389tDO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Michael Fielding (as Ra Hould)","credit_id":"57c1c334c3a36806bf00133e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Lamont","original_name":"Molly Lamont","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/4r64BWp2K9DMEDUT62ExIzCTk7s.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Fielding","credit_id":"57c1c340c3a3680690001211","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Blackmer","original_name":"Sidney Blackmer","popularity":0.227,"profile_path":"/2JzR0u8yvrkp3e0GB5cajCqGDjp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dr. Anson Ludlow","credit_id":"57c1c34d9251413f7400a038","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Waldron","original_name":"Charles Waldron","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/sYrkq7dAb0NejGlMflJL0yj88fr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Dr. Ellery Stanwood (as Charles D.
