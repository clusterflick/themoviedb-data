These facts of life are revealed in an act of virtuoso film-making that is dedicated, laconic and ultimately - impossible as it may seem - uplifting. A unique experience, this is a very significant and totally original film that will test, and reward any audience. The challenge is to spend time with lonely old people and Dolak is unflinching. He handles words, sounds and image with extreme care. His film is composed of long takes that juxtapose a daily routine alongside the expansive and empty landscapes of the north east, and both shot in exquisitely beautiful monochrome. Everything seems settled and inevitable until the film makes a completely unexpected move into another realm and intimates a further reach of the imagination.","popularity":0.4122,"poster_path":"/16ZmlTz7tZTEueO9uW7v3JHD6Oi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crystalness films","origin_country":""},{"id":100514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edinburgh Napier University","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coombs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Little Moves","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Coombs","original_name":"Tom Coombs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a758b0dc3a3685a0c030839","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Coombs","original_name":"Gertrude Coombs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a758b1dc3a3685a0c03084c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483608,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karel Dolak","original_name":"Karel Dolak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a748afec3a3685a0c021d95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512980,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irune Gurtubai","original_name":"Irune Gurtubai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a748b339251410594020747","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483608,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karel Dolak","original_name":"Karel Dolak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a748b0cc3a36859d9020007","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971965,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alastair Mackintosh","original_name":"Alastair Mackintosh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a758a3692514105a902d796","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1971967,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a758aa8c3a3686b5100774d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971966,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ryoko Tamura","original_name":"Ryoko Tamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a758a56925141059702e267","department":"Art","job":"Art Department Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971968,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Allison","original_name":"Martin Allison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a758abc0e0a266430033e13","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971969,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"D.
