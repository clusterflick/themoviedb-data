We isolated the shots in which no character is talking: the quiet lulls in the stormy debate and the wordless reaction shots. We fashioned these silent shots into a six minute montage, adding only music and non-verbal sounds from the film. No dialogue. (Well, almost none. Youâ€™ll hear).  Is the story arc still comprehensible? Can you still sense the tension and the power struggles between the twelve jurors? Judge for yourself.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/7ODpxEhUm1N5bS6B8OASOFZug8j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"12 Silent Men","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Verdeure","original_name":"David Verdeure","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6388a019d388ae007943b1f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2246,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ODpxEhUm1N5bS6B8OASOFZug8j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1588}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
