The county hospital does not have the authority to operate on a minister. The county commissioner would like the operation done in the county for the prestige it would bring, but will not authorize it without the approval of the whole county committee. The hospital director has filled his quota, so does not want to take the risk of an operation. Since a telephone call to Hanoi has to be booked two days in advance, the minister's wife cannot be contacted, nor can a helicopter be arranged to move the minister to Hanoi.","popularity":0.0607,"poster_path":"/tvq2BFviinUIuaR5Z9EqLFRUhRM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vietnam Feature Film Studio","origin_country":"VN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"1986-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Quiet Little Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1597793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bùi Bài Bình","original_name":"Bùi Bài Bình","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/vTnTV0hKvBe8N8KGMRd7c2RjAnw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7111abc3a368108300055b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thinh Trinh","original_name":"Thinh Trinh","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/bJr5HeanKDevkLq4KIR2GdDnTCU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7111b29251413d39000554","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969926,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Quoc Dung Tran","original_name":"Quoc Dung Tran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7111e0c3a368108e0005cb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duc Tien Le","original_name":"Duc Tien Le","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7111c0c3a36810800006e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969925,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Quynh Truc","original_name":"Quynh Truc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7111cb9251413d2b000530","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092082","wikidata_id":"Q130540403","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tvq2BFviinUIuaR5Z9EqLFRUhRM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto International Film Festival","release_date":"1996-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"vi","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
