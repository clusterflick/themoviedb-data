However, who was Satie? An elusive genius or a visionary misanthrope? The film tries to sketch an identikit of the musician through his notes and the places he lived in. Musicologists mostly agree in describing Satie’s music as inhabited by voids and holes. The long pauses between one musical passage and the other are musical structures unto themselves; therefore, the filmmakers create a dissonant Satie-like universe in which empty spaces are adjacent to eloquent passages. Like a mysterious flower visible only to the eye that is willing to dance with its charm, the film unfolds little by little through mental associations and creative juxtapositions. There are no answers in the universe inhabited by the ghosts of Satie’s creations. Architectural forms and recollections from desires and acts of creative hubris compete to create a new world, which ultimately is the image of a new and more seductive pleasure principle.","popularity":0.1782,"poster_path":"/mNQyf8nWhDiOBdcfvA3Ez42Wyno.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satan Satie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guto Parente","original_name":"Guto Parente","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/cVO47h9QCQUmlakDW55vwEw8MeT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62575f496bdec30050679e29","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guto Parente","original_name":"Guto Parente","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/cVO47h9QCQUmlakDW55vwEw8MeT.jpg","credit_id":"62575f6ed400f300657f054b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15119,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Satie","original_name":"Erik Satie","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/5jn7eNKDP9lURFQt2tSj84qnVC9.jpg","credit_id":"62575f14c8f3c4006851f51b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877521,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Correia","original_name":"Daniel Correia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62575ef0c439c00096f7eeeb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juruna Mallon","original_name":"Juruna Mallon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6KgB3p8jfygEX3Tk7de7J7W832o.jpg","credit_id":"5a72453d9251417f2501151e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Parente","original_name":"Lucas Parente","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7245590e0a265b0401317d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juruna Mallon","original_name":"Juruna Mallon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6KgB3p8jfygEX3Tk7de7J7W832o.jpg","credit_id":"66dcf0131f2fd04e0a9a899b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juruna Mallon","original_name":"Juruna Mallon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6KgB3p8jfygEX3Tk7de7J7W832o.jpg","credit_id":"66dcf033e4f25e1852e41fec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Parente","original_name":"Lucas Parente","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df032d7973946cccc26823","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5490306","wikidata_id":"Q27051668","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mNQyf8nWhDiOBdcfvA3Ez42Wyno.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
