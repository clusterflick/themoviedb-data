It is now the only professional ballpark with an ivy-covered wall. Although Wrigley Field has been home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series. The last World Series won by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home. The Chicago Bears of the National Football League played at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970 before relocating to Soldier Field. This marvelous DVD captures moments from the past 100 years that will be cherished by all Cub fans!
