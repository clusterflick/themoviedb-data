It is about traditional swiss architecture and interior decorations, about peoples and their garbs. There are not many dialogs and no narrator. The pictures speak for themselves. The Swiss Prealps are shown in all four seasons and in all thinkable weathers which make every landscape shot more breathtaking than the other.","popularity":0.121,"poster_path":"/qYWfspWnvLDFGLMjv8Jql8gO5qW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100471,"logo_path":null,"name":"CSR
