He broke off work on his book \"L'accident Intégral\" to put together an exhibition that was designed to illustrate the concept of the global accident in all its topicality. The outcome was the much-vaunted Ce qui arrive, which was housed in the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain in Paris from 29 November 2002 to 30 March 2003. The cinematic installation, Unknown Quantity, which was a key part of the exhibition, features the staging of a discussion between Paul Virilio and Svetlana Alexiyevich, the author of the book \"Chernobyl. Chronicle of the Future\", the essential witness's statement on the conversion of history in catastrophe.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain","origin_country":""},{"id":114055,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZKM Karlsruhe","origin_country":""},{"id":5132,"logo_path":null,"name":"Von Vietinghoff Filmproduktion (VVF)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unknown Quantity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1769962,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Svetlana Alexievich","original_name":"Svetlana Alexievich","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/fnEiuixdiXEEIEttVQiGuU6gIVX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4e56810e0a264965d70d8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Virilio","original_name":"Paul Virilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4e568ac3a368478c93b744","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Ujică","original_name":"Andrei Ujică","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/fncKs2Oyo0TdoxvOsI6eVQPR1p6.jpg","credit_id":"5a763a1cc3a36859cf037f90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
