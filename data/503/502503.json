In Jutta Brückner’s documentary, her mother looks back at the 60 years of her life, talking about her father’s early accidental death, the constraints faced by a lower middle-class family of five, her training as a seamstress, marriage to a bookkeeper committed to social democratic ideals, the privations of war, and not least of all, her later realisation that fear may have caused her to miss opportunities … An ingenious collage of picture and sound accompanies the mother’s narrative, a tapestry of proverbs, pop songs, marching music, and the noise of war. Hundreds of photographs – most selected from August Sander’s (1876–1964) project “People of the 20th Century”, alongside newer photos by Abisag Tüllmann, among others – lend the individual vita of the director’s mother a kind of ontological validity. Images of labourers and office workers, excursions and marches, imbue what we hear with references that transcend the personal.","popularity":0.0881,"poster_path":"/put9ptLDCfp4HTDzKlDRampEsBr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jutta Brückner Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do Right and Fear No One","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Do Right and Fear No One: The Life of Gerda Siepenbrink","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Do Right and Fear Nobody","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1196816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jutta Brückner","original_name":"Jutta Brückner","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a74605e925141059f01dd33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1196816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jutta Brückner","original_name":"Jutta Brückner","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7460690e0a2664390208ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237109,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jutta Brandstaedter","original_name":"Jutta Brandstaedter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7460b4c3a36859d301d062","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96987,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eckart Stein","original_name":"Eckart Stein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f43ff9847c9fb0036fc6403","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2754028,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Annegret Even","original_name":"Annegret Even","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f43ffa06eecee003457aa53","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207012,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Francisco Alcalá-Toca","original_name":"Francisco Alcalá-Toca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f43ff863f8ede0034ef6886","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0401847","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":774,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/put9ptLDCfp4HTDzKlDRampEsBr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
