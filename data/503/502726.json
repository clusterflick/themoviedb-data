The woman, who just turned 102, tells stories about her past and childhood. In a literary and visual way she describes the most minute details. The film dazzles the viewer with love and optimism, the time passes slowly between the two islands, which might be real people, real places or the products of the main character’s imagination.","popularity":0.3055,"poster_path":"/rIiLVjjhQ80hdUguXsQMJzWbzri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wajda Studio","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":56548,"logo_path":null,"name":"59 en Conserva","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriana F.
