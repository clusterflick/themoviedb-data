Seen through the close observation of the orphanage's daily life and juxtaposed with the filmmaker's visit to the children's original villages deep in the mountains, the film reveals the painful healing process of orphans struggling to cope with the psychological scars of their past. Paralleled in the film, and against the backdrop of China in the midst of a historical transformation is the conflict China Mama has with her one time friend/donor from the United States, consequently resulting in an unsettling lawsuit that threatens to close the orphanage. MAMA's GOLD makes direct comment on survival, loneliness and the universal struggle in face of great challenges.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eQN29xNj8rFSJO9aMV6Bh5SbkTS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mama's Gold: The Orphans of Shangri-La","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1972501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Cheng","original_name":"Joanne Cheng","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4nhSSF6pLqj814mE9EQU4bS0W9c.jpg","credit_id":"5a76db6b0e0a266430049b76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1972501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Cheng","original_name":"Joanne Cheng","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4nhSSF6pLqj814mE9EQU4bS0W9c.jpg","credit_id":"5a76db72c3a36859d303fe8f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0389142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eQN29xNj8rFSJO9aMV6Bh5SbkTS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
