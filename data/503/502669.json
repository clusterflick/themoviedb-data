While the conceited Sam obnoxiously flaunts his success before brother Robert, Robert himself grapples with alcoholism. Meanwhile, Candy shocks the more traditional family members by inviting her vegan boyfriend to dinner, and Aunt Michelle buckles beneath the weight of loneliness and prays aloud for a man to come into her life. These events and others all add up to a bittersweet mixture of humor and pathos, laced with Christian sentiments.","popularity":0.3256,"poster_path":"/2SQByx6CS1RNZwB570sRYBV2SiT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vivendi Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":100496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Christian Movies","origin_country":""},{"id":100497,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nu-Lite Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Spirits will be lifted and lives renewed.","title":"Johnson Family Christmas Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":324315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Burston","original_name":"Sid Burston","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/d1Z6ViBrwNZn5FWnRgqmZW0dj16.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Stephen","credit_id":"67f8a5c5ea80d85175998b85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Conner Smith","original_name":"Lynne Conner Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ms. Johnson","credit_id":"5a750336c3a36859d3026e1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerard Jones","original_name":"Jerard Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5a75034592514105a3028153","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aggie Mysty Owens","original_name":"Aggie Mysty Owens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Theresa","credit_id":"67f8a5fc7b43bdce20ae5b79","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wynne Wharff","original_name":"Wynne Wharff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Michelle","credit_id":"67f8a60e6c3583c9759a3bae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darius Kennedy","original_name":"Darius Kennedy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"James","credit_id":"67f8a635ea80d85175998ba1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":531823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raquel Giddings","original_name":"Raquel Giddings","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Candy","credit_id":"67f8a65b7f70ac1a21d9208f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3744298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"KB Holland","original_name":"KB Holland","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/xRGkY9WBAdk0YIgJUcy5st7TtqV.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"The Eagle","credit_id":"67f8a66ad81748ccff998703","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2840973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Theophat","original_name":"Christina Theophat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Chrissy","credit_id":"67f8a68cd81748ccff99870c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Mooney","original_name":"Dylan Mooney","popularity":0.1582,"profile_path":"/4UFouYuh3w1uvJLuVeWe9H9CFYO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Money Mike","credit_id":"5a75039792514105a90272b9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selethia E.
