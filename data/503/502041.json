Images of the sea ravishing the shore – small cliffs of sand eroding and collapsing – are inter-cut with extreme close-ups of text and the texture of the page and book itself being flooded with ocean waves.  In scene after scene the reader attempts to re-enter the book only to find himself a part of intense dreams and hallucinations.","popularity":0.0787,"poster_path":"/qK6cZHvFALhqzobHq2C18sQ9TyT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incidence of Catastrophe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970038,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rex Barker","original_name":"Rex Barker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a714efc0e0a265af2001841","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Hill","original_name":"Gary Hill","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a714ee40e0a265aef0018d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Hill","original_name":"Gary Hill","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a714eebc3a368607400186a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970038,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rex Barker","original_name":"Rex Barker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a714ef3c3a368606c0017d9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Hill","original_name":"Gary Hill","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a714ed60e0a265af800189c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9815378","wikidata_id":"Q20756639","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qK6cZHvFALhqzobHq2C18sQ9TyT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"\"Collected Video Essays\" Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, California","release_date":"1988-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
