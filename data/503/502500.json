It is an abstract and unpredictable world where Kafka himself moves between the scenes of his own stories, from America via The Castle to Metamorphosis, and The Trial is of course the frame story throughout. Rybczynski has chosen to portray Josef K as an alter ego. Other characters become members of his own family, which means that Rybczynski makes a kind of exemplary, depth psychological close reading of his work.","popularity":0.1065,"poster_path":"/qhaOJzdKMcf3Whyr3Aws3fysSpx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kafka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lucas","original_name":"Peter Lucas","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kafka","credit_id":"5a745e2f0e0a26642a020a17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgit Bofarull","original_name":"Birgit Bofarull","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/pSiR8CROW1vmu7iauwzNRVqHx0Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Felice","credit_id":"5a745e3f925141059701d9b1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zbigniew Rybczyński","original_name":"Zbigniew Rybczyński","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/1oJ6D9QiZPWnBtWQliYezC7qwSz.jpg","credit_id":"5a745e03c3a36859cc01fdd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0168913","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1092,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhaOJzdKMcf3Whyr3Aws3fysSpx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
