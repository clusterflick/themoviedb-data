Once, a devastating flood hits a nearby village and he goes there to minister to the affected people. At this time, he happens to rescue a Muslim child, Husain, whose entire family has been wiped out. He raises the boy as his own, alongside his own son, Ajay. As a good Hindu, he decides to raise the boy in the religion of his own parents, and Husain thus grows up to be a practising Muslim living in the backdrop of a Hindu household. Everyone loves the new addition to the household and Husain also is deeply attached to his new family.","popularity":0.197,"poster_path":"/93zXu6voEnWVj5uzPEjoqt00EqL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shankar Hussain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanwaljit Singh","original_name":"Kanwaljit Singh","popularity":0.3761,"profile_path":"/pitJUd0ySbOBrGOzLJBJ63fMLaK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7487ab92514105a901f9c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":624985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pradeep Kumar","original_name":"Pradeep Kumar","popularity":0.2738,"profile_path":"/A4B3GEUfDsZS961jiwaGHrrwGQi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a74882c92514105a302056e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madhu Chanda","original_name":"Madhu Chanda","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a748840c3a36859d901fd67","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shreeram Lagoo","original_name":"Shreeram Lagoo","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/6tVwvit8BUsz39ddEBnDP6Hivo7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7488bec3a36859ec0230ca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1009518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jalal Agha","original_name":"Jalal Agha","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/uLhINCStPUEkXtOwdB1e31fhOEU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7488d2925141059f020438","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608034,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mohammed Rafi","original_name":"Mohammed Rafi","popularity":0.2119,"profile_path":"/yJxR84bzya3W8N6aezj8iu0aQmI.jpg","credit_id":"65ca629d266778016358c200","department":"Sound","job":"Playback Singer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yusuf Naqvi","original_name":"Yusuf Naqvi","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7487f00e0a266433022d51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994400,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kamal Amrohi","original_name":"Kamal Amrohi","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/9M0qRK8Ao5enGNejdQ3JPbmBtRG.jpg","credit_id":"5a748819c3a36859ec02302b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0274086","wikidata_id":"Q7488691","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93zXu6voEnWVj5uzPEjoqt00EqL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":934}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
