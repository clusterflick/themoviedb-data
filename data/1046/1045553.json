The film traces the influence of General Stonewall Jackson’s vigorous faith on the profane, unbelieving Ewell. When Ewell meets God on the battlefield, he learns that surrender to God brings true victory. The story of these two men is complemented by the exploits of the flamboyant General Jeb Stuart. Red Runs the River is a saga of history, humor, and excitement, showing that strong convictions change the course of nations—and men.","popularity":0.1895,"poster_path":"/40Y70FDQA6NehVGHHrOcHhsoN4n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Runs the River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Jones Jr.","original_name":"Bob Jones Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Richard Stoddert Ewell","credit_id":"65b103533c43440193662461","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Jones III","original_name":"Bob Jones III","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jeb Stuart","credit_id":"65b103752fe2fa01723ce0fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3498917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Buttram","original_name":"Jack Buttram","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Stonewall Jackson","credit_id":"65b103a115c6360193aab90b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4497399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lonnie Iglesias","original_name":"Lonnie Iglesias","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Apache","credit_id":"65b103cda3144001515a8de7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5315369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Clark Green","original_name":"Stephen Clark Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lof9eYs9xU6eTcJtI4VbRUi6IRc.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"67db102ac60d5177ade9d14b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Stenholm","original_name":"Katherine Stenholm","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63697b3ed4cc8e007b27a3b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Applegate","original_name":"Charles Applegate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1ad486eecee017b33e3e3","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Applegate","original_name":"Charles Applegate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1ad0a0f2fbd01636673ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356819,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dwight Gustafson","original_name":"Dwight Gustafson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b83850258823013a4c9f07","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3401371,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George Jensen","original_name":"George Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b83859ab684900e23005ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170584,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eva Carrier","original_name":"Eva Carrier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8382611386c00caf7193a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356820,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wade K.
