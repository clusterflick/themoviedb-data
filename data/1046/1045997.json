She is also an actress, an aspiring mountain guide and hopes to be the first in her family to complete secondary school. These are significant ambitions for anyone; in Uganda, they are nearly unheard of for a young girl. If Mbambu becomes a guide in the Rwenzoris - an impressive accomplishment in its own right because the mountains reach to nearly 17,000 feet - she would break all sorts of cultural and societal barriers for women in West Uganda. As this film tells the story of a hopeful Bakonzo girl, it also examines a culture transitioning from harmful poaching practices into more sustainable livelihoods.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/vPJvVnqCIfnnTVwePb6RZNOvrNW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mbambu and the Mountains of the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucian Muntean","original_name":"Lucian Muntean","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636ac6559653f6007af73880","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2594223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataša Urban","original_name":"Nataša Urban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bSeXvAug5RVCcoQI44xPwJR1qMZ.jpg","credit_id":"636ac66366565a008ac2b701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2594223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataša Urban","original_name":"Nataša Urban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bSeXvAug5RVCcoQI44xPwJR1qMZ.jpg","credit_id":"636ac7e1d4d509007a663844","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2594223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataša Urban","original_name":"Nataša Urban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bSeXvAug5RVCcoQI44xPwJR1qMZ.jpg","credit_id":"636ac7ee6dc507007c8f4b65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9743652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2033,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vPJvVnqCIfnnTVwePb6RZNOvrNW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1356}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
