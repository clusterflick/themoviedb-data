Because all his customers pay on credit, he has no money, and the phone company is taking out the pay phone. Pal Bert Lahr agrees to get the news on his phone, and forward it to Haggerty. To top it off, Haggerty is getting a business loan, and doesn't want anyone to know about it, so Lahr agrees to not mention it when anyone is about. Naturally, Lahr's fiancee shows up when Lahr gets the call, and thinks it's his child.","popularity":0.1841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Educational Films Corporation of America","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whose Baby Are You?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Lahr","original_name":"Bert Lahr","popularity":0.3411,"profile_path":"/ArYiG2D7IWRrTZorgUQZyrhkdjj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bert Halibut","credit_id":"6369c95b1e9225007a6e4ebf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Haggerty","original_name":"George Haggerty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6369c9651684f7007a9c26d4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"6369c91e9d6e33007a5ae9db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227813","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1936-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
