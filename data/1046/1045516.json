The nature of that film, however, belies a rich career in film and journalism that spans the Vietnam War, the Allende government in Chile, the emergence of gay rights in San Francisco, a 1981 Bob Marley documentary, an Oscar nominated film about Nelson Mandela (1997), and the Street Talk television series, as well as close relationships with key figures from the 20th Century. Born into a life of privilege, Menell had progressive political inclinations and soon left apartheid South Africa for Britain where he was schooled in the ways and connections of the British ruling class. The film chronicles his amazingly rich and varied life using archival footage alongside a series of interviews conducted with Menell while his portrait was being painted by Cape Town artist Beezy Bailey.","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":"/tccJ8b7FutLj6bGdROCLcvnGNTE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berwick Universal Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2019-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life of Jo Menell: Americans, Mongrels, & Funky Junkies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Life of Jo Menell","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Yule","original_name":"Paul Yule","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b8fd5719aeb0477ebe1cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11205412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c89YZZkMqJuVCtqQGIlZJnugKcI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tccJ8b7FutLj6bGdROCLcvnGNTE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
