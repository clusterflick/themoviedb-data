I also play the piano and do solo singing and I go to a Russian school so I can speak French, Russian, German, Swiss-German and a little bit of English and… I think that’s all.” 8-year-old Julie dreams of becoming an actor and a singer. She works hard to achieve this. The film follows her day-to-day life and, if nothing else, raises the question of whose dreams are being pursued here – Julie’s or those of her overambitious parents.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julie Wants More","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Regina Meures","original_name":"Susanne Regina Meures","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/1iukmK2j9X9s2tFFUDozzjybgao.jpg","credit_id":"636ac29bc15b55007cc8bdd4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Regina Meures","original_name":"Susanne Regina Meures","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/1iukmK2j9X9s2tFFUDozzjybgao.jpg","credit_id":"636ac29766565a008ac2b654","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Regina Meures","original_name":"Susanne Regina Meures","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/1iukmK2j9X9s2tFFUDozzjybgao.jpg","credit_id":"636ac2a1caaca2007a09ba71","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3159402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
