Using a DIY luma keyer by Videofreex member Chuck Kennedy to approximate a flying saucer, the group conscripted neighbors to participate in a mock news report about the “sighting”, capturing the feel of Catskills local color in the process. The segment was produced by Videofreex with collaborators including Ruth Rotko and John Keeler, who worked on a spate of subsequent UFO-related video pieces, before wandering off into their own, wildly divergent careers: Rotko as a producer of independent films like GRACE OF MY HEART, and Keeler as a prolific pornographic cinematographer pseudonymed “Jane Waters”.\" - Screen Slate","popularity":0.2724,"poster_path":"/3YwtN9AWQi4oyPL23GT5zU6SyRw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lanesville UFO Incident","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3773371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Rotko","original_name":"Ruth Rotko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367ee1ee7c097007aebd7a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":997540,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jane Waters","original_name":"Jane Waters","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367ee56ea84c7008239dbf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3YwtN9AWQi4oyPL23GT5zU6SyRw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
