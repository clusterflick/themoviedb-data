Refusing to change her name to something “less Jewish”, Myerson proudly held fast to her Jewish identity even as antisemitic advertisers and pageant insiders tried to sway judges against voting for her. During her year-long reign, Myerson was denied hotel accommodations and refused entry to country clubs. The experience galvanized Myerson to commit her future to fighting racism by delivering anti-racist lectures in schools and universities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The One and Only Jewish Miss America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3776210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Arond","original_name":"David Arond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636a8211e0ec5100818d039a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
