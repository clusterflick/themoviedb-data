Georgy Konstantinov, 19 years old, blew up Stalin's monument in Sofia and death passed him by only because the dictator died two days later. He miraculously survived 10 years in prison and psychiatric wards and managed to escape to France. His State Security file numbers more than 40,000 pages. Even today, he does not cease to expose the crimes of the regime with the strength of truth and of his character.","popularity":0.3807,"poster_path":"/7gwcUJater4e07srzwxNwMdL6Uj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heros Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2019-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Freedom of Georgy Konstantinov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Last Freedom of Georgi Konstantinov","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Poslednata svoboda na Georgi Konstantinov","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3773214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgy Konstantinov","original_name":"Georgy Konstantinov","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6367d6dbc048a9007e8f80f8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rossen Elezov","original_name":"Rossen Elezov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367d684ebb99d00795fb816","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rossen Elezov","original_name":"Rossen Elezov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367d6711e9225007a6d5cf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3773212,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tosho Peykov","original_name":"Tosho Peykov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367d6bd9d6e33007a5a298b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rossen Elezov","original_name":"Rossen Elezov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367d69766565a007d507bf2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597585,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Konstantin Tzekov","original_name":"Konstantin Tzekov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367d6a866565a007a44fe2d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7gwcUJater4e07srzwxNwMdL6Uj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6539,"name":"joseph stalin"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":256427,"name":"bulgarian history"},{"id":306135,"name":"bulgarian communist party"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
