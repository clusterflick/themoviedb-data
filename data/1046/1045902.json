A former employee of the Levi family in Croatia, Mihaljic was visiting them at a holding camp in Mitrovica, Kosovo, when the grandmother of two-year-old Esther asked if she would take the child and raise her as her own. Mihaljic agreed and bravely risked her own life by disguising Esther as Roma, thereby saving her. This previously unknown story is brought to life in this moving documentary recounted by Esther Levi herself.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/joKoFrNRQw1PtQbIo8YqBCehtxI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215289,"logo_path":null,"name":"AS film","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":165096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ollendorff Center","origin_country":"US"},{"id":215290,"logo_path":null,"name":"OPIS","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Righteous Gypsy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4415561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Levy","original_name":"Esther Levy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6570335541ad8d06e1863b3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4415562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaron Levi","original_name":"Yaron Levi","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6570336479a1c300e18e5534","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1686688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dominik Sedlar","original_name":"Dominik Sedlar","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":"/yEZsEYL0jOK1ZDEmLsTrsqwSmyj.jpg","credit_id":"65703336383df2014e8b4a82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1686688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dominik Sedlar","original_name":"Dominik Sedlar","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":"/yEZsEYL0jOK1ZDEmLsTrsqwSmyj.jpg","credit_id":"636a84f7391b9c007b6640bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jakov Sedlar","original_name":"Jakov Sedlar","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636a850a391b9c008b0e88c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6035988","wikidata_id":"Q27043529","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/joKoFrNRQw1PtQbIo8YqBCehtxI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
