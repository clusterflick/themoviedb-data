It maps the architecture of the six bridges that connect Manhattan to the rest of the world by using an artifact to cover the lens of the camera: the colors and flickers of the videos are a result of the interactions of the artifact and direct sunlight being interrupted by the different architectural features of the bridges.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6kUycTkDyAbbnK1DNjvinJcUCsg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossing Bridges on Sunny Days, Eyes Closed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2647160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Bayo Gisbert","original_name":"Manuel Bayo Gisbert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/unLFSnrzDlR1Qgbj1fmzzifa70M.jpg","credit_id":"6368974f1684f7007a9ba39c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2577,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6kUycTkDyAbbnK1DNjvinJcUCsg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
