Mouse hopes King will choose her, so she starts to make the cave as cosy as possible, but that just causes a disagreement with the overprotective Dragon. The pair even fight at the Christmas market, and go their separate ways. Mouse hangs out with the foul-mouthed Brother, while an unfortunate spell renders Dragon invisible and inaudible. Which makes a reconciliation difficult, of course.","popularity":0.0647,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":141371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majority Flemish Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Can Mouse and Dragon resolve their differences in time for Christmas?","title":"Sir Mouse Christmas Special: Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006543,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tom Van Gestel","original_name":"Tom Van Gestel","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67546e98b1eaa5c891db3277","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marianne Op de Beeck","original_name":"Marianne Op de Beeck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67546ebc8e033e9136dcb490","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
