It is made using digital transfer versions of c90 tape compilations I made between 1992-1995, juxtaposed with moving image footage of me in 2018 and 2020 and a typeface font graphic ‘See Me’ that I designed in 2005. The c90 cassette on screen is the cassette compilation that I still have from 1994. The film also includes drawings and photographs and other artworks from my personal archive as an artist from the last 25 years.  As I walk down the streets that were so important in shaping my life as a young gay man living in London, I revisit the gay bars and pubs that have been my safe spaces for the last twenty years and more, spaces that are now closed.","popularity":0.2073,"poster_path":"/gnb9n8paRibo5wVmoGeGSDZPfM9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See Me: A Walk Through London's Gay Soho in 1994 and 2020","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2753144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Campbell","original_name":"Lee Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6368f17dcaaca2007dd0b989","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gnb9n8paRibo5wVmoGeGSDZPfM9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212,"name":"london, england"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":161693,"name":"soho london"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
