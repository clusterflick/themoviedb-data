The original title, Tannhauser und der Sangerkrieg auf Wartburg, reveals the real nature of the opera, born by a fusion of two traditional sagas and dedicated to the dualism of spirituality and sensuality and the possibility of redemption through love. Composed between 1843 and 1845, Tannhauser has a tormented musical theme, made up of constant variations. It debuted in Dresden in 1845 when Wagner was just over 30.","popularity":0.1756,"poster_path":"/er1cMOzosP8EBkRMMLZ6HVcwVS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3086,"logo_path":"/iksa7hXQMvPIzfSq0Tuo4WPU8gc.png","name":"Image Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tannhäuser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser","type":"USA (DVD title)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Woodrow","original_name":"Alan Woodrow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Tannhäuser","credit_id":"59c28b56c3a36803fd000428","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludwig Baumann","original_name":"Ludwig Baumann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Wolfram","credit_id":"59c28b6f9251416897000491","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrud Ottenthal","original_name":"Gertrud Ottenthal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Elisabeth","credit_id":"59c28b8a92514168970004b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Silvestrelli","original_name":"Andrea Silvestrelli","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hermann","credit_id":"59c28ba892514168ac000528","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolov Bojidar","original_name":"Nikolov Bojidar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Walther von der Vogelweide","credit_id":"59c28bc8925141685f000524","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Konsulov","original_name":"Ivan Konsulov","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Biterolf","credit_id":"6344ca307a97ab008281a7b2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrizio Saudelli","original_name":"Patrizio Saudelli","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Heinrich","credit_id":"6344ca40cdf2e6007f321a44","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezio Maria Tisi","original_name":"Ezio Maria Tisi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Reinmar","credit_id":"6344ca545b4fed007ae7c64a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Pentcheva","original_name":"Mariana Pentcheva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Venus","credit_id":"6344ca62d6c3000082187c20","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156035,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustav Kuhn","original_name":"Gustav Kuhn","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self -
