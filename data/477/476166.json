Director Francois Abou Salem brings a modern Middle Eastern sensibility to this journey into Arabian and Muslim culture, filtering the comic tale of abduction for today's audiences. Soprano Christine Schafer portrays Constanze, a woman whose heart is torn between her fiance, Belmonte (Paul Groves), and her new master, Pasha Selim (Akram Tillawi). A sensual and resoundingly modern experience, this new interpretation casts new light on a classic musical work and infuses it with aching human emotion.","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":"/302e3jcE31ONURKOtODSpG8yDGL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15790,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Media","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1997-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: Die Entf체hrung Aus Dem Serail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1563837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Sch채fer","original_name":"Christine Sch채fer","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/7ye11j7mlpzpw5Nj6vAb3riZC4F.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Constanze","credit_id":"59bd916092514135250180c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":269140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Groves","original_name":"Paul Groves","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Belmonte","credit_id":"59bd917d925141356d01826e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":570236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akram Tillawi","original_name":"Akram Tillawi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pasha Salim","credit_id":"59bd91b4925141352501812f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Hawlata","original_name":"Franz Hawlata","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Osmin","credit_id":"59bd91cdc3a3681b6e017a72","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malin Hartelius","original_name":"Malin Hartelius","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/f2oag0FivnRM7hQelpQI94ORo8k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Blonde","credit_id":"59bd91e9c3a3681bc0018ad9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Conrad","original_name":"Andreas Conrad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pedrillo","credit_id":"59bd91fb925141356d0182f2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"59bd920cc3a3681b9701a28a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleandre Tarta","original_name":"Aleandre Tarta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bd9325925141354a018bf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379924,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gottlieb Stephanie Jr.","original_name":"Gottlieb Stephanie Jr.","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bd9355c3a3681b9701a3f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Minkowski","original_name":"Marc Minkowski","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/o5Az1vnk5zowbyj37xLwNqYMmB7.jpg","credit_id":"59bd9255925141356d01834f","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0260003","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1437,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/302e3jcE31ONURKOtODSpG8yDGL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":955}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
