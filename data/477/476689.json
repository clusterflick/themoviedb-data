In his teens, Max ran away to California, where he met Teschlock, a charismatic ascetic and guru renowned among a small group of young followers. At that time, when Teschlock asked Max to join him and his disciples on an ashram in India, Max declined and returned home. Now, forty years later, at age 57, Max takes a journey to India to find Teschlock's grave-site, and also himself. His adventures in India, and his Castaneda-esque experiences back home, form the heart of this very unusual road movie.","popularity":0.5755,"poster_path":"/dDZzsfdIEwNc9wsDSB1G5NRvXFP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't worry.
