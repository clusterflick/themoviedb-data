In 1979, Bill Viola and Frank Caliguri dreamed up a contest pitting barroom bigmouths against wrestlers, martial artists, boxers, bouncers and brawlers, billed as no-holds-barred new type of competitive fighting. When the fights succeeded beyond their wildest expectations, they were swept up in a chain of events that ended in the first mixed-martial arts ban in the nation.  “Tough Guys” chronicles the inception of Caliguri and Viola’s first bouts and the colorful, crazy cast of fighters who made them a hit as well as the politicians who brought it all crashing down. The film brings to life a moment when the national martial arts craze was building to a crescendo as the economies of Pennsylvania steel towns were plummeting to levels of unemployment never seen, breeding desperate men looking for a chance to prove their worth and make some money in the ring.","popularity":0.6846,"poster_path":"/sq5UDkTLGrEVpBiF8zaQTqWYMJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warrior Poets","origin_country":"US"},{"id":95201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fictionless","origin_country":""},{"id":95202,"logo_path":null,"name":"MinusL Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tough Guys","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1892008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59c309c69251415b280040f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Caliguri","original_name":"Frank Caliguri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59c309d69251415b32003e89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1892010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dann Carr","original_name":"Dann Carr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59c30a11c3a36813a9003e14","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacquet Bazemore","original_name":"Jacquet Bazemore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59c30a299251415b5d003e70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Cvetic","original_name":"Jimmy Cvetic","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59c30a39c3a3681403004395","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"W.B.
