Roberto Devereux was composed in the summer of 1837, the year, according to biographers, in which Donizetti seems to have suffered most, having lost his third son and his adored wife Virginia Vasselli. The opera made its debut at the San Carlo Theatre in Naples on October 28th in the same year and was a great success. The rehearsals of the original performance were postponed for a month due to censorship of the decapitation scene of the leading actor.","popularity":0.1541,"poster_path":"/cOCjDdrUMYgak7vd9C9lEs7LbOu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Progetto Italia","origin_country":""},{"id":3086,"logo_path":"/iksa7hXQMvPIzfSq0Tuo4WPU8gc.png","name":"Image Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roberto Devereux","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Sabatini","original_name":"Giuseppe Sabatini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Devere7x","credit_id":"59bd4794c3a3681b15012c68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Servile","original_name":"Roberto Servile","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Duke","credit_id":"59bd47a4c3a3681b6e012a25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildik贸 Koml贸si","original_name":"Ildik贸 Koml贸si","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Duchess","credit_id":"59bd47ccc3a3681bae0125db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Lefebvre","original_name":"Pierre Lefebvre","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/t5ltbACmDX2jaBZukDdiAbIcNPE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cecil","credit_id":"59bd47dbc3a3681b15012cd1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Del Bosco","original_name":"Carlo Del Bosco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gualtiero","credit_id":"59bd47f9c3a3681b97014ad1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"59bd4810c3a3681b97014afb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382767,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Salvadore Cammarano","original_name":"Salvadore Cammarano","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bd4851925141352501305c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":100225,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alain Guingal","original_name":"Alain Guingal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bd4864925141352501306e","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alberto Fassini","original_name":"Alberto Fassini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bd487692514135610142b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0260327","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cOCjDdrUMYgak7vd9C9lEs7LbOu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1449}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
