In one segment a woman misreads an advertisement and arrives at a job interview dressed in a bunny suit. Another concerns a woman who hides to surprise her friends only to overhear their unkind appraisal of her hygiene. And another entitled \"Grandpa from Hell\" is a surreal yarn about a cult leader. Ranging from the humorous to the deeply bizarre, the film's static, minimalistic style makes such \"Dogme 95\" films as The Celebration (1998) look extravagant.","popularity":0.5049,"poster_path":"/g8PBdpbVkF3nOeL2bbAEjljuKF9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Piece! 水玉 COLLECTION","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoji Tanaka","original_name":"田中要次","popularity":0.823,"profile_path":"/752oL9YrUumjrqbhdj4GNJ938x3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63183f5446e75f00a575249a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satoru Jitsunashi","original_name":"寺十吾","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/6s5UH6PFa9dQBOH1AGxcBEcZyAp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63183fb422931a00980a7601","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nao Nekota","original_name":"Nao Nekota","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63183fdcfac50200a2c0ec22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Nishida","original_name":"西田尚美","popularity":0.7151,"profile_path":"/kXRGUSybmoyiQ5iqNtGq5aBGei4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67252c800174b9909cdf2bee","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takuji Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木卓爾","popularity":0.3869,"profile_path":"/fUOVWR3upxekGxSK533cLLsKGiZ.jpg","credit_id":"63183e94ed2ac2007a3434d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinobu Yaguchi","original_name":"矢口史靖","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/1wwEJVpbCv1xtSB6PLUK3ye6MXo.jpg","credit_id":"63183eda91745b007b8dab43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/g8PBdpbVkF3nOeL2bbAEjljuKF9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":904}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto International Film Festival","release_date":"1999-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bergen International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
