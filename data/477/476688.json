Klaus Mann (John Gross), a present-day Philadelphia avatar of the real-life European author of Mephisto, lives in the shadow of his father, the eminent intellectual, novelist and Nobel Laureate Thomas Mann (Ernst Hohmann). When Klaus pens a controversial essay on \"revolutionary suicide\" and then acts on it, in protest of the world's selfishness, a group of his contemporaries speak up in filmed interviews about what led him down that path. It is a film about the creative process, the tragic depiction of a strained father-son relationship and, most of all, it is a film about individuality.","popularity":0.2828,"poster_path":"/345is7Zri9P8IHZB7pN3QextE3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Klaus Mann had a short life...and a long death.","title":"Sophisticated Acquaintance","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2703036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gross","original_name":"John Gross","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Klaus Mann","credit_id":"5f0245ca8ec4ab00353fb559","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Nilsson","original_name":"Rob Nilsson","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/kqMgOljEdjiXSo8iWuOZ75ccPTr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f0245eaebb99d00367f4d70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4484578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katya Quinn-Judge","original_name":"Katya Quinn-Judge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gia","credit_id":"66564591b574283c940dedb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4741643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Hohmann","original_name":"Ernst Hohmann","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Thomas Mann","credit_id":"665645c6a638fc9a0fc16cfe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Walsh","original_name":"Glenn Walsh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bruce Jummaquin","credit_id":"665bd2baf0d540c12ae7932a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Cully Allen","original_name":"William Cully Allen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Malcontent","credit_id":"665bd2c99ddc940932bc6266","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4741572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brooke Somers","original_name":"Brooke Somers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Girl on Bus","credit_id":"666330872aea84512f14fe49","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kris Caltagirone","original_name":"Kris Caltagirone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Andrew","credit_id":"6663309a2b8f2a8860503eae","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"59c191829251412beb0029d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"665a179c5e86abc4252d77d5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2447670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":769,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/345is7Zri9P8IHZB7pN3QextE3M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":13028,"name":"writer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
