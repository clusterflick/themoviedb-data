Rupert is a stuffy lawyer who has emigrated to Canada, while Dale ekes out a living dealing drugs. Along the way, they find themselves stranded in a commune where their father once lived, populated by a pack of half hippie/half redneck dropouts who like to get high on mushrooms and drive trucks. George Wendt appears in a supporting role.","popularity":1.8345,"poster_path":"/Jj6UIIw3qIrmcAkYSw4WtWv4Fx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rupert's Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel West","original_name":"Samuel West","popularity":1.0188,"profile_path":"/bn1nd5zERi5wyHcA1YMGvrHAD5L.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rupert McKay","credit_id":"5e908d3ffdc14600114816ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Tracey","original_name":"Ian Tracey","popularity":0.6088,"profile_path":"/dUzzLVVUF0pvGzS3xrIZ5tiC2TT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dale McKay","credit_id":"5e908d65cee4810012e0e835","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Wendt","original_name":"George Wendt","popularity":0.7437,"profile_path":"/noQKS06TbuPJQ9o91CzKbEvTwZR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ivan Bloat","credit_id":"5e908d8815959f0012ee0bcf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Hogan","original_name":"Susan Hogan","popularity":0.7341,"profile_path":"/9gwOXpJOCPd6cGh4vKd2C9H7njl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Trudy","credit_id":"5e908dbd00fb6b001aa185d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Miller","original_name":"Gabrielle Miller","popularity":0.517,"profile_path":"/vrN08aTTNmMG0VBXQ0Oc7Eb9ifT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shelley","credit_id":"5e908ded197de40015077d4e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William MacDonald","original_name":"William MacDonald","popularity":0.5274,"profile_path":"/1eLETdGqGW1b26lhn4l57dlSgJA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Brad","credit_id":"5e908e1ee640d6001b1f8cf9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1853280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Kozma","original_name":"Ted Kozma","popularity":0.1932,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Weaver Loogan","credit_id":"5e908e3ad35dea0018759101","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernie Coulson","original_name":"Bernie Coulson","popularity":0.3822,"profile_path":"/f2wEUrV4RrG4IH4cn1hT7ogR0ZA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bud Loogan","credit_id":"5e908e7a00fb6b0013a18f8d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":75529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzy Joachim","original_name":"Suzy Joachim","popularity":0.4627,"profile_path":"/jskeqLKa3diJFvOhyotzSgwU88g.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tina","credit_id":"5e908fa315959f0019edfb53","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Cardinal","original_name":"Ben Cardinal","popularity":0.4002,"profile_path":"/qN2mfIgvRPwlICybIWRkvcXA9Bs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bartender at Party","credit_id":"5e908fc5197de4001b07874c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank C.
