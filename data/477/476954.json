Jahrhundert","overview":"German director Gordian Maugg creates this curious documentary/reenactment of the life of Hans Warn, adventuring sailor-turned-photographer. Born in Bremen in 1899, the young Hans signs on to the good ship Herbert in 1914, but not before he persuades his mother to buy him a camera. What starts as a hobby soon develops into a passion. Soon Hans is documenting his life on the high seas and his ship's six-month capture during World War I. Later, Hans marries the girl next door, Wilma, but their family life is sporadic because of his seafaring career. Maugg uses a wide palette of cinematic tricks and devices to recall the early years of the century, including sepia tinting, decorative intertitles, distressed footage, and other idioms of early silent documentaries.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/yahnNFO6d77Y1hwau5TYUqLkw9S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hans Warns: My 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordian Maugg","original_name":"Gordian Maugg","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c323e59251415b6e0066ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215828","wikidata_id":"Q23013867","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.688,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yahnNFO6d77Y1hwau5TYUqLkw9S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
