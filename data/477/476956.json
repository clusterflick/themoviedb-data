Malli works to help her parents collect firewood and plays with her best friend, the deaf and mute daughter of a middle class family. She longs for two things in this world: a new bright yellow dress and a magical blue bead that purportedly will restore her friend's hearing. Depicted with a surreal, occasionally nightmarish texture, the film lyrically shows both the easy friendships and bitter disappointments of childhood and the power of the imagination.","popularity":0.1614,"poster_path":"/9Cxj6jC8dpFTwkxXHl1mjxQ5FZS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1999-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malli","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37236,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Santosh Sivan","original_name":"Santosh Sivan","popularity":0.3374,"profile_path":"/7COuX4wHedARjHSsMU51rzXD1GP.jpg","credit_id":"59c328849251415b28007389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37236,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Santosh Sivan","original_name":"Santosh Sivan","popularity":0.3374,"profile_path":"/7COuX4wHedARjHSsMU51rzXD1GP.jpg","credit_id":"5f9592214f9a99005ce16abe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2291988,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aslam Mustafa","original_name":"Aslam Mustafa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f959295c3bffe0043d22798","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37242,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sreekar Prasad","original_name":"Sreekar Prasad","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/cHpDtVlleMlplodhKmjPCGqaAFS.jpg","credit_id":"5f95927e8c0a4805afd36182","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37236,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Santosh Sivan","original_name":"Santosh Sivan","popularity":0.3374,"profile_path":"/7COuX4wHedARjHSsMU51rzXD1GP.jpg","credit_id":"5f959244c3bffe0043d2272d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ravi Deshpande","original_name":"Ravi Deshpande","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95925f99d5c30032d27997","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37236,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Santosh Sivan","original_name":"Santosh Sivan","popularity":0.3374,"profile_path":"/7COuX4wHedARjHSsMU51rzXD1GP.jpg","credit_id":"5f959270a12856004cc03e65","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0293385","wikidata_id":"Q3534370","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.578,"height":1297,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Cxj6jC8dpFTwkxXHl1mjxQ5FZS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
