Together with his two older brothers, he was put to work along the Death Railway between Burma and Thailand. While Daniel's brother Jan did not survive captivity, his other brother Jozef was killed during the civil war that raged in the colony right after the war. As Dutch citizens, the descendants of African warriors were forced to leave the new republic of Indonesia in 1950. Through the years in The Netherlands, Daniel Cordus has fought for recognition of all Indo-Africans who have died for the Dutch flag. Seventy years after his captivity, he finally returns to Burma to visit the grave of his brother Jan.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4Sooen19fRJzHEjBJ4gQRFQKNAJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De vergeten krijgers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Griselda Molemans","original_name":"Griselda Molemans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59becba5925141473b00393a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Griselda Molemans","original_name":"Griselda Molemans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59becbae925141473b00394b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7331058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A4PtdzYGjj03q8qFjL4Nle0lQ4g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sX0l1OlIAvRokBzmKQFU1WHbcDq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2339,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Sooen19fRJzHEjBJ4gQRFQKNAJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
