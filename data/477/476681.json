Arriving in Israel from Moldova in the 1990's left Sophia unstable and yearning for more. Her well educated parents are unable to control their only daughter as she rapidly descends from singer in a rock-band to drug addict and to prostitute. Sophia is strong and weak, vulnerable and impervious. Her wrenching journey into darkness is strikingly documented by filmmaker Ohad Itach whose chance meeting with Sophia leads not only to a powerful film, but to the possibility of moving forward.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loving Sophia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ohad Itach","original_name":"Ohad Itach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c18e6b9251412bc20027b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1684901","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
