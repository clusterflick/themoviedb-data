Feynman. It brings together the foundations of \"Film as the Seventh Art; a superb conciliation of the 'Rhythms of Space' and the 'Rhythms of Time'\" by Ricciotto Canudo and \"Music is the pleasure the human mind experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting\" by Gottfried Leibniz.  The work deconstructs film as the perfect synthesis of art and technology. Connecting art and science, it romantically refers to an age when artists and scientists had similar concerns and were often one and the same person.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six Easy Pieces","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1834194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Wretman","original_name":"Helga Wretman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/kPPv5s1F0IwrsY6Ldp4GdYrT8W7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c3467320e0a2654bbd84042","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2210860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana J.
