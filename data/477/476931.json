Jesse Banks Rhodes (Harry Connick, Jr.) is suddenly and inexplicably released from jail after serving part of a life sentence on a trumped up charge for murder. He heads back for Georgia to reclaim his life and finds himself staying with farmer Ben Alexander (Pete Postlethwaite). Initially, Ben's family is mistrustful of the ex-con, but slowly they begin to warm to him, particularly Ben's fragile daughter Wesley (Patricia Clarkson). After witnessing the murder of a black worker at the hands of his drunken white racist boss, Jesse vows to make things right.","popularity":1.116,"poster_path":"/xQd0kx3aG0GtV6TuCi0s6LAOa2W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wayward Son","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Connick Jr.","original_name":"Harry Connick Jr.","popularity":0.6561,"profile_path":"/il1t0cshowbZ6mMtH1930baQx9n.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jesse Banks Rhodes","credit_id":"5c9f7799c3a3687359818641","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Postlethwaite","original_name":"Pete Postlethwaite","popularity":1.856,"profile_path":"/2gpa75Ci4y2OKmOc8WXnaeGgyKF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ben Alexander","credit_id":"5c9f77a40e0a265986f8b75f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Clarkson","original_name":"Patricia Clarkson","popularity":0.7979,"profile_path":"/rHHM9G83fpBAcFathbSyV4Tot5j.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wesley","credit_id":"5c9f77afc3a36873528175cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinessa Shaw","original_name":"Vinessa Shaw","popularity":0.8516,"profile_path":"/qqSpAMH1lYMNxnHkDHB1JpNa086.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cordelia","credit_id":"5c9f77b80e0a265989f8a810","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walton Goggins","original_name":"Walton Goggins","popularity":4.7182,"profile_path":"/5lcVMJbWrNDFiWa1WxK4oR8zwev.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c9f77c3c3a3687348819eac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Afemo Omilami","original_name":"Afemo Omilami","popularity":0.3598,"profile_path":"/usW1GHq20ZEX3rpei1HpeXfSpiP.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Horace","credit_id":"675c388b4b5280ff0c1c02d3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Newton Howard","original_name":"James Newton Howard","popularity":0.9427,"profile_path":"/qB4JgzCXCjr7NwW7UNrgBrWZDlo.jpg","credit_id":"63fa24ef25a5360083631e32","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40151,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louise Rubacky","original_name":"Louise Rubacky","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fa253184f24900a9414430","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27154,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Hennings","original_name":"David Hennings","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fa24d1344a8e007cb9aa2d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56187,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Porcaro","original_name":"Steve Porcaro","popularity":0.1879,"profile_path":"/iRF33gOWVHuyqzpahuBjIq3Z9Eu.jpg","credit_id":"63fa24df57176f007cfcdaf9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958921,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David Crank","original_name":"David Crank","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fa251984f24900ef611aad","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall Harris","original_name":"Randall Harris","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c3057f9251415b28003814","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1301732,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Helen P.
