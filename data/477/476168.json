Amiable Trevor McIntosh faces two major problems. He wants to get away from his overbearing mom, philandering father and his older brother; and he wants to lose his virginity. Trevor tries hard at the latter, but can't seem to connect with the young women who interest him. Then he meets Charlotte Peacock, an artist in her '60s. She accepts Trevor and encourages him. They start out as friends, but gradually become much more.","popularity":0.8956,"poster_path":"/7Vf5ism29MJerKSmhQIB96Lpl35.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live Bait","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":534315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Scholte","original_name":"Tom Scholte","popularity":0.2567,"profile_path":"/aRjCkT8H0Qk4rGfi7ciatBIKcDg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd96fdc3a3681bae0178d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin McNulty","original_name":"Kevin McNulty","popularity":0.5144,"profile_path":"/jaXuLA5zYPVzfG8wLtnD2O4aveA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd9708c3a3681b6e018066","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babs Chula","original_name":"Babs Chula","popularity":0.2448,"profile_path":"/8AVQQb6vYWuyjpYK8a07ExNk5OZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd9719c3a3681b6e01807b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lovgren","original_name":"David Lovgren","popularity":0.2795,"profile_path":"/hFJ2K2QApj0XEPeqkhIiHigIK2s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd972292514135060198ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":182886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micki Maunsell","original_name":"Micki Maunsell","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd9732925141353d018914","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Brazeau","original_name":"Jay Brazeau","popularity":0.8849,"profile_path":"/sfZmnOv1Nd6jqeks5QtsW2Co3uH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd973cc3a3681bc001915a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Beaudoin","original_name":"Michelle Beaudoin","popularity":0.3038,"profile_path":"/4FJCTLoSmCwcju9szjE0VPKJS8n.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd974f925141354a019127","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laara Sadiq","original_name":"Laara Sadiq","popularity":0.5281,"profile_path":"/l7MkydwslaXo1EmYrRpJARnaFKs.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd9756c3a3681b8601a118","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Aisenstat","original_name":"Kelly Aisenstat","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd9766c3a3681b8601a12a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":279018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Duborg","original_name":"Kathleen Duborg","popularity":0.3493,"profile_path":"/y2ydKXs8ORtwKsbq1gPXfcvvnGG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"59bd977292514135250187d2","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1049212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Sweeney","original_name":"Bruce Sweeney","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bd9625925141354a018fbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113673","wikidata_id":"Q18167943","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Vf5ism29MJerKSmhQIB96Lpl35.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
