The audience was expected to believe that the twentysomething Twelvetrees and Frank Albertson are teenagers living together platonically in an orphan asylum. A wealthy old man comes calling to adopt Albertson -- who, feeling sorry for Twelvetrees, trades places with the girl. Thus it is that the heroine is carted off to a luxurious mansion, while Albertson remains behind. One year later, the old man discovers Albertson's deception, whereupon he invites the boy to live with him as well. By this time, Twelvetrees and Albertson are of marriageable age, thus the film ends with a wedding in the offing.","popularity":0.5736,"poster_path":"/j0p3V6X7h2IcI1tUm89tXbi91Wr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two foundlings find love!","title":"Blue Skies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmencita Johnson","original_name":"Carmencita Johnson","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/trDaM4tI3AEwLXgEiIxnfbcjax8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dorothy May (age 6) (episode 1)","credit_id":"5c115a640e0a26314300874b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Burke Frederick","original_name":"Freddie Burke Frederick","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/mPpnRIVMSCrue4YxOvt8z8J8QpN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Richard Lewis (age 8)","credit_id":"5c115a709251414f29066d0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Wales","original_name":"Ethel Wales","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/8TspAWWfu1IvRbQ46FrD9hJrtoO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Matron (episode 1)","credit_id":"5c115a7c92514167ab01840b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":287378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Twelvetrees","original_name":"Helen Twelvetrees","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":"/mnJkSfc8ltFPitNbolNEk0rte9H.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dorothy May (episode 2)","credit_id":"5c115a899251414f29066d53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Albertson","original_name":"Frank Albertson","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/sT9JZ8GgHgunZS4PWIDX6wMoIS7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Richard Lewis (episode 2)","credit_id":"5c115a950e0a2638b8102d55","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1075194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Gore","original_name":"Rosa Gore","popularity":0.1499,"profile_path":"/wEWNhvQJDKKzNBO6yidceFSfqCv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Nellie Crouch (episode 2)","credit_id":"5c115aa392514147950f6f2d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":244289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Orlamond","original_name":"William Orlamond","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/2lWrKjMjLDLMbDGPguvaQ60YLHh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Janitor","credit_id":"5c115aaf0e0a263143008835","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":999884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.H.
