Based on a real-life recording, Sweet Childhood is a playful animated short with two narrators—namely, the Zvianes of past and present. Guided by her own voice from 30 years ago, the celebrated author of Les deuxièmes employs a range of techniques to evoke the naïve charm of children’s drawings, giving graphic form to her quirky, youthful narrative. The result is a hilarious short that questions just how “sweet” childhood really is. A slice of everyday life, courtesy of the Comic Strip Chronicles.","popularity":0.1085,"poster_path":"/9tSZORa3K72H8qSZsRIndThuiEk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Childhood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zviane","original_name":"Zviane","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7f7956c3a36818b70123ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7744998","wikidata_id":"Q51462274","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9tSZORa3K72H8qSZsRIndThuiEk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":668}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
