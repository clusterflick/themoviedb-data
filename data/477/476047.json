It’s fair to say that once you lay eyes on his shorts, it’s hard to shake their visceral effect in a hurry. Eleven years after first screening his work at SUFF, Umbilical World represents a curation of Firth’s most popular shorts to date, each bookended by brand new transitional animations.  Using surrealist techniques to explore depression and mental illness with some of the darkest humour this side of the twenty-first century (his work has been featured on Charlie Brooker’s Screenwipe and Mitchell & Webb), Firth has become one of the world’s most significant, independent animators. Umbilical World is a brain-melting celebration of Firth’s short but prized career — a dog-stew of animated fancies from the scabland toybox that is his mind.","popularity":0.0762,"poster_path":"/3JHGu7Vv2iYo25BTRgiTgYegYA6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umbilical World","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Firth","original_name":"David Firth","popularity":0.335,"profile_path":"/gTSqoZQPn3bwOxiExZg4apdGS4B.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Salad Fingers / Various","credit_id":"6724087d90004810fecb1529","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Firth","original_name":"David Firth","popularity":0.335,"profile_path":"/gTSqoZQPn3bwOxiExZg4apdGS4B.jpg","credit_id":"59bca696c3a3681bae0078e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Firth","original_name":"David Firth","popularity":0.335,"profile_path":"/gTSqoZQPn3bwOxiExZg4apdGS4B.jpg","credit_id":"6724089601c4dbfa94f6758c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9349046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9K58DxwPz8CdFr0yB7WcS8MxcR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3JHGu7Vv2iYo25BTRgiTgYegYA6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Umbilical World Trailer","key":"tDzHFhZJ3bc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-31T17:53:03.000Z","id":"672c2010d98bbc3977ad0edd"}]}}}
