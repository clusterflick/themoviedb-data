Produced by and starring Ruth Roland for FBO Studios, a small operation that later became RKO Pictures, Dollar Down follows Roland as the spendthrift daughter of a manufacturing firm’s general manager (Henry Walthall), who pawns a ring purchased on credit to throw an extravagant party and sends the family’s livelihood into a tailspin. Because its last reel completely disintegrated before it could be copied, the film remains an ultra-rare curio that nonetheless captures an important chapter in Browning’s career before his successful string of films made for MGM.","popularity":0.1902,"poster_path":"/4WDo0DHo8yKyF9uQMyWrAzfqWpx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dollar Down","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Browning","original_name":"Tod Browning","popularity":0.2784,"profile_path":"/9iVkFjCS86V1UzcBERvHFjT58RC.jpg","credit_id":"59c31b63c3a36814030060f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0015756","wikidata_id":"Q3712653","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4WDo0DHo8yKyF9uQMyWrAzfqWpx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
