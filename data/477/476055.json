Filled with the frontier spirit, prospectors came and gave rise to what was one of the largest cities in Canada at that time - Dawson City. The boomtown, which became known as \"the Paris of the North\", earned the reputation as a place where lives could be revolutionized.  Brought to life with excerpts from the celebrated book The Klondike Stampede - published in 1900 by Harper's Weekly correspondent Tappan Adney - and featuring interviews with award-winning author Charlotte Gray, and historians Terrence Cole and Michael Gates, The Klondike Gold Rush is an incredible story of determination, luck, fortune, and loss. In the end, it isn't all about the gold, but rather the journey to the Klondike itself.","popularity":1.315,"poster_path":"/2PqMZhImq4PMTAWGlkxRVkfSB5F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87941,"logo_path":null,"name":"WNED-TV Channel 17","origin_country":""},{"id":95319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gold Rush Productions Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":95320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rogers Broadcasting Limited","origin_country":""},{"id":113618,"logo_path":"/yvv5stkMzsYElS7o54285edjzoZ.png","name":"Paperny Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tells the legendary story of the Alaska-Yukon Gold Rush.","title":"The Klondike Gold Rush","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":172843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.
