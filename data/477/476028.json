Since opening in 1957, the family owned and operated restaurant has become known for the warmth and passion of its host. The unique history and charm of this Irish pub has attracted notable diners such as Archbishop of New York, Timothy Cardinal Dolan; former NYC Mayor, Michael Bloomberg; Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein; author Mary Higgins Clark; former Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith; and actress Kathie Lee Gifford—all of whom dine at Neary’s regularly, and all of whom make major appearances in the film.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/9EFQuGJiVXk8472uKId9LcVFXS2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Immigrant's Life Story","title":"Neary's: The Dream at the End of the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9EFQuGJiVXk8472uKId9LcVFXS2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/romLT8xksNpurM3SqirwrEU9fHL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
