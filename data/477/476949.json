The Holdens keep Jackie, but he eventually goes to the city when the elderly couple lose their farm and retire to the poorhouse. Jackie next is befriended by Cesare Gallo, a sidewalk musician who was also the teacher of Paul Savelli--now a famous violinist. A chance meeting with Savelli by Jackie reunites him with Gallo just before the old man dies. Savelli takes Jackie home with him, happily discovers the boy to be his son, and restores the farm to the Holdens.","popularity":0.3646,"poster_path":"/xMTGOTs9Q7rl8KID5a0IJNGr4dL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43846,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jackie Coogan Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daddy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Coogan","original_name":"Jackie Coogan","popularity":0.6788,"profile_path":"/nTyszFKR1OCzEDs0kmUtz1g2msq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jackie Savelli / Jackie Holden","credit_id":"5d54813200bfe800153181b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","original_name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/oU2gb8ZKlXfdze6JcLJCAQTH5i6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Paul Savelli","credit_id":"5d548138b76cbb0016d848cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josie Sedgwick","original_name":"Josie Sedgwick","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/byJqHZyix7CLmi9bS7jvGHLL5nz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helene Savelli","credit_id":"5d54813da135330012fb4a06","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesare Gravina","original_name":"Cesare Gravina","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/dwrv8VttqLIDlp7M5P6fUftRdhd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cesare Gallo","credit_id":"5d5481456905fb00163e54fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Woodruff","original_name":"Bert Woodruff","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/5zypi4quf8pSeDpMqkbBcmHm7CS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eben Holden","credit_id":"5d54814bb76cbb38f4d82843","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Townsend","original_name":"Anna Townsend","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Holden","credit_id":"5d54815200bfe80014318346","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willard Louis","original_name":"Willard Louis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bEECwhCpsn1oT8YXGidm5ePRmaW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Impresario","credit_id":"617b1850f031740042a4d5a0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Kuwa","original_name":"George Kuwa","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/3FLRNdB4219ZfrZyS3qND4z6SLz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Valet","credit_id":"617b185f678259002ab824e8","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"E.
