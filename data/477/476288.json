This Gothic, psychological melodrama follows the events that caused his descent into madness. The decision about what to do with the ashes of their recently deceased deadbeat father plays a central role in the fraternal turmoil. At 21, Esteban is the oldest son. He eventually returns to his hometown of Curerenavaca one year after his father's funeral. Esteban loves travelling around. He arrogantly calls himself a writer and considers himself among the intellectual elite. But despite his grandiose pretensions, Esteban is decidedly lacking in talent; however, his good-hearted, humble little brother Juan is brimming with it.","popularity":0.1555,"poster_path":"/DLc05uiXzhrksNgDHmsnn4cMnH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1997-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guilt Free","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Guiltless","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martín Altomaro","original_name":"Martín Altomaro","popularity":0.2207,"profile_path":"/mwIiaS58KQ9VSDdTRChoHkD4GYq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59be9bd9c3a3682ff80003f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Barraza","original_name":"Natalia Barraza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59be9c009251414756000445","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa María Bianchi","original_name":"Rosa María Bianchi","popularity":0.268,"profile_path":"/sTHKx5UvklFgF3uRqHDFmm3vUzz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59be9c2dc3a3682fb8000457","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1315507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Socorro Bonilla","original_name":"Socorro Bonilla","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/kAIvkfNXPiQVhxY4pL4KYWW2j3I.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59be9c77925141474500049b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1044094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susana Contreras","original_name":"Susana Contreras","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"59be9c82c3a3683075000569","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masha Kostiurina","original_name":"Masha Kostiurina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59be9ca2925141472a000507","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Sisniega","original_name":"Marcel Sisniega","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59be9b9bc3a3683065000354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0160463","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/DLc05uiXzhrksNgDHmsnn4cMnH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":976}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
