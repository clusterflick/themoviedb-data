Her love appears to be unrequited, though, because the major thinks she is far too young--and also, unknown to her, because he had once been in love with her mother. When a fellow passenger on the ship takes advantage of the naive girl the major comes to her rescue, but in the process the girl finds out about the past relationship between he and her mother.","popularity":0.4165,"poster_path":"/qlTEt4BihEJibl3h5WWJKs81VnZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura La Plante","original_name":"Laura La Plante","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/oiathkwBPkrBNX5jdwiE4GQlVDn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ann Church","credit_id":"66be86df94f8acdda25aae8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene O'Brien","original_name":"Eugene O'Brien","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/xgK8VBc7jLcbfpY1PPpRPRqkt1J.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Major Seymour","credit_id":"66be8716efe85dde475590fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gilchrist","credit_id":"66be87496c5ded02e49b965d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedda Hopper","original_name":"Hedda Hopper","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/kfXPY1cSrOmjJ3TYrGF4giT6EPI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Muriel Church","credit_id":"66be8768cd7bc1090a403cad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milla Davenport","original_name":"Milla Davenport","popularity":0.2907,"profile_path":"/kkXVbELEC3ElcZW2Fes2kV8E7DN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Stewardess","credit_id":"66be87811604b60f26403b14","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Allen","original_name":"Alfred Allen","popularity":0.2206,"profile_path":"/9UK19FDQYBqYwJ5JBirpaeLsHw6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Captain Rome","credit_id":"66be87957ba075160350cc42","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Humphrey","original_name":"William Humphrey","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/j1UuxcTCQ48fBKjT6sU4iOuIwP1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"John Church","credit_id":"66be87a99e47b5f38f979bdf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Mattox","original_name":"Martha Mattox","popularity":0.1855,"profile_path":"/42D4sj76ZMCrWAiPMmU3PWUvCjc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Aunt","credit_id":"66be87bb9ec961dc1dc390e4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Gaynor","original_name":"Janet Gaynor","popularity":0.3467,"profile_path":"/kwyClWei18GOssMPbrs4RL61izG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"(uncredited)","credit_id":"66be87c3596c0bfb039b882c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William A.
