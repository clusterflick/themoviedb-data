She proceeds to terrorize the neighbors, tripping two men hauling large cartons by ensnaring them with pieces of string. She drops a pumpkin on a shopkeeper’s head, ties someone’s furniture to a moving vehicle, and then explodes fireworks inside a plumber’s protruding drainpipe. He puts out the flames in a tailspin by jumping into the river.","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":"/1MbO4DlK3AkYdvvFYDqEM9StjHN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léontine, the Troublemaker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Betty Again","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4050160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Léontine","original_name":"Léontine","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Léontine","credit_id":"6458004b6c849200e35d19ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Duhamel","original_name":"Sarah Duhamel","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/xYlZsihZNfNU9fpE5XXnMyL6EAI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madame Penouillard","credit_id":"6453ebe187a27a0138a6c15b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Bosetti","original_name":"Romeo Bosetti","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/fcIANwE4rSLFdjhlcNVhf8PUkp9.jpg","credit_id":"6429f595ac8e6b00f209c427","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1804600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1MbO4DlK3AkYdvvFYDqEM9StjHN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2268,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qpXweJ0Gbl5OmYZqzNWtDJovF8e.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1512},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/438c67UgKGsGgFlLOK0OlLJd9fH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Kino Lorber","release_date":"1911-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
