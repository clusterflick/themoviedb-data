'Protectors' who support the residents fighting against the action move into the village to help protect it. People who have lived different lives gather in the same space and try to build a new community in Daechuri. As the villagers make up their mind to move, they experience another kind of separation. The faces of so many people who strived to protect the community they dreamed of are reflected on the backs of those who set off for a new place to live their lives.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/g6hcwiKHoab0G3lf9VnzpNb0lsN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of Daechuri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2429726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jung Il-gun","original_name":"Jung Il-gun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9f369df0647c003fce47f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1519648","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g6hcwiKHoab0G3lf9VnzpNb0lsN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":844}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
