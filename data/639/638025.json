During his remarkable life, Norman helped set the course of post-war Japan and played a key role during the Suez crisis. But with all of his talents and achievements, there was something haunting Herbert Norman and following him to every corner of the globe: the accusation that he was a Soviet spy. This documentary takes us back to a time when the Cold War was heating up and when the mere accusation of communist sympathies could destroy a man's career. Using de-classified documents, interviews with key players and dramatizations filmed around the world, the film reconstructs the ordeal that Norman endured for seven long years, as a US Senate subcommittee relentlessly probed his past beliefs and current loyalties.","popularity":0.4206,"poster_path":"/wnu5W9m7YrfcxB12RKReCAjWbVD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
