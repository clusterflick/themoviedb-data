Melons is a video based on images and script about my auntâ€™s death from breast cancer and the emotion void in my memory. The text is a construction of rituals that plays with notions of the authentic. The act of juggling too much text and imagery immerses the viewer in a third, imagined narrative.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":"/6RQv3QKjhZfMgeTS071ngR5askZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melons (At A Loss)","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patty Chang","original_name":"Patty Chang","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5da1325fb84f940018978092","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patty Chang","original_name":"Patty Chang","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da1326d1967570011a6919f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30989889","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wf5sX8oM5Rm5GyjsTI1jc5dKRr4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1299}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6RQv3QKjhZfMgeTS071ngR5askZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
