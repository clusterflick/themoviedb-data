And this man she speaks to, does he really exist? Unless the director has interpreted Cocteau’s words to the letter and the telephone has become a “terrifying weapon that leaves no trace, makes no noise”…","popularity":0.29,"poster_path":"/9xz8Ka9JZqFynUKNvh8rYuvtTtt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":15789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telmondis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A unique merger of two one-act operas","title":"Poulenc's  The Human Voice / Bartók's Bluebeard's Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Relyea","original_name":"John Relyea","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/k0fNi4cMx4mdf8TIY1bCu7AqhRR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Duc Barbe-Bleue","credit_id":"5d9d579a4772150041032f02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Gubanova","original_name":"Ekaterina Gubanova","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/kL0dGC98pgvGTBulLjV49PmzfAY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Judith","credit_id":"5d9d57b1a5046e001f8327da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Bardouil","original_name":"Claude Bardouil","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Him (silent role)","credit_id":"5d9d57e7a5046e001f832881","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Hannigan","original_name":"Barbara Hannigan","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/cxXsoVoXnt8W81mnibjgN3Ds89r.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Her","credit_id":"5e8a24ec168ea30014e5e1c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esa-Pekka Salonen","original_name":"Esa-Pekka Salonen","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/eVA3KfJXGuM46MVAM0ckmgbyssr.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Self -
