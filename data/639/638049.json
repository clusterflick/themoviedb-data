Berg's uncompromising portrayal of brutality and madness generated much controversy, but the significance of Wozzeck was soon recognised; its compelling lyrical expansiveness, large-scale dramatic gestures and remarkable musical structures producing music of overwhelming emotional intensity. The Financial Times declared this to be 'a beautiful, moving, engrossing production… this is a consummate Wozzeck, blending clarity, lyricism, compassion and crushing force.'","popularity":0.2178,"poster_path":"/rBuVWf0mVO9SgkbbCfcZVfPlvjx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch National
