Dramatizations are collaged into almost indistinguishable narratives and presented through concentric rectangles, like a flickering conveyor belt of popular cultural content. The forty-eight war films play simultaneously and continuously, and the accompanying soundtrack generates an indecipherable cacophony of wartime sounds.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/c8WUqprk5zGo5qgR12CDqx6tDf2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"48 War Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Marclay","original_name":"Christian Marclay","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9e09007f0540001eab57fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c8WUqprk5zGo5qgR12CDqx6tDf2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Art Biennale","release_date":"2019-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
