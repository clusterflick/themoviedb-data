They were both locations for entertainment built by different dictatorships: The Sport City of La Boca was built during Ongania's de facto government, and the Interama amusement park opened near the end of the last military regime. Today both places are in ruins and their surroundings harbor settlements and shanty towns where thousands of families live, many of them migrants and in extreme poverty. Through a thorough investigation, Oesterheld becomes an explorer with a privileged eye who films the transit of those characters as they frequently pass through these places, and he depicts the present day over the tracks history left on the urban landscape. The result is a Buenos Aires City seen from its ends with perplexity, beauty, emotion and a neutral eye. The film combines densities with an analytical storytelling that is yet deeply atmospheric and transforming through the reality it manages to capture.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/2kufrsQrlkTJAWPLP8h8mMLEesn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Oesterheld","original_name":"Martín Oesterheld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9df6c03d4d96003782b977","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Oesterheld","original_name":"Martín Oesterheld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9df6c98e2ba600410b0903","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583162,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Guillermo Saposnik","original_name":"Guillermo Saposnik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9df6d08e2ba600410b0907","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1855246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2kufrsQrlkTJAWPLP8h8mMLEesn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
