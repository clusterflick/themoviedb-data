Diriģents. Kamēr…","overview":"A documentary about the well-known Latvian youth choir “Kamēr...” and its journey to the Tolosa Choral competition. A debut from a 20 year old singer of the choir, the film offers a deeply personal insight into the most difficult challenge the choir has ever faced. After the head conductor leaving, the choir has just 2 months to get used to a new leader. A test for the new conductor who has to prove his worth at one of the most important competi-tions of the choir’s history. It’s do or die, as nothing less than a victory will be accepted. Following the choir every step of the way, the director puts the audience in a first-row seat at rehearsals, performances, discussions and spectacular moments that can only be seen through the eyes of a singer. An unprecedented view of the personal battles and achieve-ments, that lead up to a real-life story, never captured before.","popularity":0.1892,"poster_path":"/vo3ErFpa3AXQ1GgRIccE9ydwGAm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Choir.
