In addition to demonstrating their talent, this film provides a look at their personal lives, lives that have always revolved around the magic of the carnival (Which lasts just a month per year), but that inevitably must make room for their daily life, far from show business and public recognition.","popularity":0.1209,"poster_path":"/qnQvJ8Uw0R5KfLmzubgfAilnNoW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coral
