It captures their subjective memories, often frozen in time and in everyday life. Only strong impressions of sadness, joy, suffering, which reflect the great history of the 20th century. There is no truth about the past, it is only the human mind that actually makes morytates - bloody enlightening stories and legends.","popularity":0.2385,"poster_path":"/dDPxLzdDGypaQ6e7fPECDVW42So.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder Ballads and Other Legends from Ladomírová","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Moritaten und Legenden aus Ladomirov","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Legends and Morytates of Ladomirova","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489045,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mária Kadlecová","original_name":"Mária Kadlecová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635d6c61fd63000081980ca5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421144,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Igor Hudec","original_name":"Igor Hudec","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635d6c83ba4802007ed5e92d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2734653,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivan Nagy","original_name":"Ivan Nagy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635d6c7641eee1007a0d0ed6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Kerekeš","original_name":"Peter Kerekes","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/4dX63rTxK8WVCKATXIIZM0ztV5I.jpg","credit_id":"5d9e23577646fd0035751976","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Kerekeš","original_name":"Peter Kerekes","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/4dX63rTxK8WVCKATXIIZM0ztV5I.jpg","credit_id":"5d9e249d7f0540001cab7afd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732671,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marek Piaček","original_name":"Marek Piaček","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9e25407646fd001b751c35","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1425607,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Kollár","original_name":"Martin Kollár","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9e254f7739410036d10b20","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0206869","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dDPxLzdDGypaQ6e7fPECDVW42So.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":323255,"name":"rusyn"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"One World Film Festival","release_date":"2003-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
