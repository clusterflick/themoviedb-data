Her only precious thing is a glass ball that is a memory of her mother whose death has left Saale alone in the world. She has been repelled and humiliated, so she is not expecting anything good to come from people. For her surprise, young fisherman Tanel is ready to walk with her by the sea even if they won't speak a word. He doesn't think Saale is strange and he won't ridicule her for her religious views.
