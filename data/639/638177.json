Rather, as an animal’s night call, it exists vanishing in its own closure and muteness. The film reestablishes itself onto its state of unsolved, lost and forgotten space, as a word without name, experiencing itself as a simple gesture, dreamily suspended through its own electric tension, far from any sort of destination, salvation, redemption.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/fetgFVCh13wR2DfLtTEPsIgaiDc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saved Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1619857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Boccassini","original_name":"Giuseppe Boccassini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9e04df3d4d96003782d18c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fetgFVCh13wR2DfLtTEPsIgaiDc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica","release_date":"2020-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CROSSROADS","release_date":"2020-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
