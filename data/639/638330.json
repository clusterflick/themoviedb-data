Rockets launched overhead from the nearby Cosmodrome inspire their dreams as they write about and perform their imagined future-selves. Guided by the nomadic spirit and natural beauty of the Steppes, the orphans explore questions of time and truth in relation to the challenging reality of their lives. Traditional Kazakh culture, global popular iconography, and space travel are infused throughout their performances and imaginatively used as protective talismans on their journey into an uncertain adulthood.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/p8d3bwk4zwRUKUkTL5l75nHiBVR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journeys Beyond the Cosmodrome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanne C.
