A series of land and sea battles pitted Americans against British over a three-week span in late 1814 and early 1815. The stunning victory by Andrew Jackson's army over Sir Edward Pakenham's troops on January 8, 1815, ranks as one of the greatest upsets in military history. This program uses historical materials, expert interviews, and skillful re-enactments to bring this conflict to life.","popularity":0.0827,"poster_path":"/qfXAiNNTlGv7ywTIqAgWbxW7whH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamsite Productions, Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The last significant military engagements of the War of 1812","title":"The Battle of New Orleans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Magill","original_name":"John Magill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"656b433288055100e36f1eac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Wiese","original_name":"Jason Wiese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"656b434988634800ea469ff4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert V.
