Lenny, the birthday boy, is an insecure young man who has something to prove. After he's already had too much to drink, his cynical drinking buddy Willy goads him into proving his marksmanship by trying to shoot a bottle off his wife's head with a revolver. This black comedy is a farcical twist on the William Tell legend and on the true story of William Burroughs, who, likewise under the influence, tried to shoot a glass off his wife's head, missed and shot her dead instead.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Barbecue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bigham","original_name":"John Bigham","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lenny","credit_id":"6569e52fd399e600e10566eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Jalenak","original_name":"Jan Jalenak","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Martha","credit_id":"6569e53ea313b800c4e7e889","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4406664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Santoro","original_name":"Michael Santoro","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Willy","credit_id":"6569e55cb7d352012c39d673","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085270,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Beckman","original_name":"Adam Beckman","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6569e5a7ea37e000ea46ddd3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188002,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Hoagland","original_name":"Christian Hoagland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6569e590cf48a1013b957cbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruedi Gerber","original_name":"Ruedi Gerber","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/jOjN7AaBGX6QXU7JZMTEO66Csdh.jpg","credit_id":"6569e56bb7d35200ea8c7ebe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188002,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Hoagland","original_name":"Christian Hoagland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6569e585d04d1a00cb8bcbfc","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150726,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pascal Akesson","original_name":"Pascal Akesson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6569e5b371f09500aa0ebedc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30236273","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
