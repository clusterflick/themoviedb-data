In the home of Widow Ejlersen and her adult son John, money is tight. John has spent his last dime on his mother’s rent, and as his boss refuses to give him an advance, he cannot even buy her a Christmas present. That evening, John drifts aimlessly along the wintry streets while his boss, manufacturer Berg, and his little daughter Else open large presents in their beautiful, warm living room. In sheer desperation, John decides to rob Berg’s house, and the evening takes an unexpected turn.
