Dictionaries, documentaries, sociology books about the first humans. However, what we found was a series of poorly disguised lies throughout a system of audiovisual representation of the last government, but also of all governments.

In this case, in relation to salt, lithium, myths, mythologies, and mystifications.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3X2GYINHW8DhPAOaJtzHXfSo4uL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214905,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colectivo La Vertiente","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2022-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nada tiene el color","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Gutiérrez","original_name":"Carlos Gutiérrez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656ac676886348012c886aa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657644,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gilmar Gonzales","original_name":"Gilmar Gonzales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656ac5f988055100c6805d3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camila Rocha","original_name":"Camila Rocha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656ac6b14a4bf600ad2c2213","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esteban Prudencio","original_name":"Esteban Prudencio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656ac6114a4bf601034f952f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3X2GYINHW8DhPAOaJtzHXfSo4uL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
