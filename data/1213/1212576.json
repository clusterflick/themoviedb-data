It's been a thrilling journey. Mournful explorations of parental paranoia and Scandinavian solitude crumbled under the force of a newly emerging identity straining to devour societal interdictions and accepted gender frameworks with 2017's Plunge. Splintered facets of a stridently non-binary personality were explored with 2023's Radical Romantics along with a very human need for intimacy, its most vulnerable moments still as steely and unsettling as a shark circling its prey. Experience the idiosyncratic Fever Ray vision for this exclusive Passengers session beamed in from an abandoned factory in northern France.","popularity":0.1355,"poster_path":"/232lHJf49DepSk6EgFJCYHoQPSx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fever Ray in Passengers - ARTE Concert","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":3,"id":583338,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karin Dreijer","original_name":"Karin Dreijer","popularity":3.992,"profile_path":"/v5G1aT9jKNmGxnmLQNczFDhOGoB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fever Ray","credit_id":"65ef851a7304b5017abeb41a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Minna Koivisto","original_name":"Minna Koivisto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Musical Director & Keyboardist","credit_id":"67808f082b29a918d04e64ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romarna Campbell","original_name":"Romarna Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Drummer & Percussionist","credit_id":"67808f2638817437e2bb0a53","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Guttara","original_name":"Helena Guttara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Vocalist & Dancer","credit_id":"67808f347732209e17bb4bfe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2568013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryam Nikandish","original_name":"Maryam Nikandish","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Vocalist & Dancer","credit_id":"67808f46a6778aa5b37b54a7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1877333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Lefèbvre","original_name":"Sébastien Lefèbvre","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67808eb9912cb27280bb1e72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169987,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karin Dreijer","original_name":"Karin Dreijer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67808f9b78cfcd77ed4e5649","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AeIU5n6bkm6huvLPguNlc05vz17.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1144,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/232lHJf49DepSk6EgFJCYHoQPSx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fever Ray in Passengers - ARTE Concert","key":"mTyi42VYITw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-01T19:00:07.000Z","id":"67808fc678cfcd77ed4e565e"}]}}}
