One of them – Lieutenant Borch – immediately falls in love with Udo’s sister, Ebba, and she with him. While caught up in the rush of new love, he receives a letter from a loan shark to whom he owes money, demanding that he pay the debt immediately. Although his feelings for Ebba are genuine, he is now forced to plan a proposal in order to pledge Ebba’s dowry. When her father, the major, gives his blessing for the marriage but follows this up with the disheartening news that there will be no dowry, Borch finds it hard to hide his desperation. What he does not realise is that the major is simply out to test whether the suitor has noble intentions.
