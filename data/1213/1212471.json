The comic genius with an electric mind, with a range of talent that left us breathless. The one who amazed and kept us entertained until the very end, and whose sole purpose in life was to make people laugh. Living life to the fullest, he went from one memorable film role to the other. But behind the upbeat, frenzied facade of Robin Williams was a sensitive and vulnerable man, deeply plagued by depression and haunted by his demons. Few comedians have ever been as beloved as Robin Williams. His story is full of tragic moments. It inspires us to look past the mask of those people who seem to have a perfect life. His legacy, reaching way beyond his body of work, lives on. We look back at the journey and tragic loss of a unique comic legend...and one of the greatest comedians of all time.","popularity":1.7673,"poster_path":"/nnNmRLcAeugdaBvVaZHv31xm3tJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robin Williams: Laugh Until You Cry","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Azaria","original_name":"Hank Azaria","popularity":1.511,"profile_path":"/yFDw4b0jucuFWNnGcBPfpYUtn16.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"656b1f90fcadb4011f887e37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Carteris","original_name":"Gabrielle Carteris","popularity":0.8833,"profile_path":"/5HtRKrS5GB404n2HWqGw0xIj5I2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"656b1f9c4a4bf600ad2c45f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Chan","original_name":"成龍","popularity":10.6432,"profile_path":"/nraZoTzwJQPHspAVsKfgl3RXKKa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"656b1fb10859b400c5364c0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Crystal","original_name":"Billy Crystal","popularity":1.2294,"profile_path":"/jfcCceTnP7rrHz1pSjCxiqRosw3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"656b1fb54a4bf601202774cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Kingsley","original_name":"Ben Kingsley","popularity":3.4493,"profile_path":"/vQtBqpF2HDdzbfXHDzR4u37i1Ac.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"656b1fc24a4bf600ad2c4602","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexei Sayle","original_name":"Alexei Sayle","popularity":0.5025,"profile_path":"/enPx0Zr32XX91rnOWJX6nScS5Ud.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"656b1fcd6517d6015164fd2e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Capurro","original_name":"Scott Capurro","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/lkkNhcapftYSM2tFR125eu1f9tF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e9280d6beaea01867906a9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3156248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Jagow","original_name":"Lee Jagow","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65e9281aaf95900161db9a11","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Williams","original_name":"Robin Williams","popularity":2.3362,"profile_path":"/iYdeP6K0qz44Wg2Nw9LPJGMBkQ5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"656b1f850859b400ff74f4ba","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3041535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxane Schlumberger","original_name":"Roxane Schlumberger","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656b1fe46eecee011df79779","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3041535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxane Schlumberger","original_name":"Roxane Schlumberger","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656b1fee568463010f82ab17","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nnNmRLcAeugdaBvVaZHv31xm3tJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Trailer Release","release_date":"2022-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
