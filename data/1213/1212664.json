Here he finds board and lodging with Marietta, who lives alone with her sick mother, and soon Durand has won the heart of his young hostess. Their happy state is threatened by the wealthy farmer Jerome, who has been courting Marietta in vain for a long time and is not about to abandon his hopes of eventually marrying her. He tattles on the couple to Marietta’s mother, who immediately suffers a heart attack and dies at the mere thought of a poor painter as her son-in-law. When Durand is simultaneously called away to the big city, Marietta’s mind is greatly clouded.
