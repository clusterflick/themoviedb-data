But I was not prepared for the surprise that took place when I looked through the camera at Linda. I suddenly saw her as never before and asked without hesitation if she were Aztec. She responded enthusiastically that indeed she was, in fact, her middle name is Izcali, after the important Aztec festival month of rebirth.
