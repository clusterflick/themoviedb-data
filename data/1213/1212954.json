Once every 4 years, over 7,000 cyclists from across the globe head to France’s capital to take on this gruelling 1200 km.  Thousands of spectators flock to the roadsides of North-West France to support the riders; some of whom will be attempting to finish first, riding non-stop for over 48 hours, whilst others are just trying to make it back to Paris before the 90 hour cut off time.  We follow British amateur riders Jack Thurston and Amy Hudson as they tackle this monumental challenge for the first time, along with veteran French rider Dominique Lamouller, racing Paris-Brest-Paris for the13th time, along with his son, ex-pro road racer Loïc Lamouller.  A gruelling course, intense heat, and sleep deprivation, will our riders make it back to Paris?","popularity":0.1557,"poster_path":"/iNeEUeFbDMPKTMiLJBD6MFous5z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris-Brest-Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zTdNDpeX0px3yGTUjWpHjTbZjyw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iNeEUeFbDMPKTMiLJBD6MFous5z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Paris-Brest-Paris","key":"lryzaG8ypG8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-24T11:49:48.000Z","id":"65723a1a6c849200eac6b9ba"}]}}}
