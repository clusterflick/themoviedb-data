The narrative texts alternate between English and Korean and are accompanied by a dramatic soundtrack of Jazz-style music composed by the artists. They tell the story of a confrontation between two people, one of whom shoots the other in the wrist before demanding he be shot in the forehead. While the English text tells the story in a coherent manner, the Korean text appears only intermittently, consisting of fragments of phrases and loaded words such as ‘eroticism’, ‘sex’ and ‘attractive proposal’. The title of the work alludes to the dramatic conventions of cinema even though this ‘trailer’ has no images.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":214944,"logo_path":null,"name":"YOUNG-HAE CHANG HEAVY INDUSTRIES","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TRAILER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Young-Hae Chang","original_name":"Young-Hae Chang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656b5c034a4bf600c50200a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
