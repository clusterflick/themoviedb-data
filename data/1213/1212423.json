The Aravalli Range is the world's oldest fold mountain range, and it helps to sustain the ecosystem. Ground water levels have been drained and average rainfall has also been depleted as a result of continual mining for the past 35 years, resulting in a serious water crisis. On the other hand, mining is the primary source of income for the majority of the population. As a result, this film examines both sides of the same coin - the economy and the environment.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aravali: The Lost Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jigar Nagda","original_name":"Jigar Nagda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656afcc66eecee011df78c81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17497162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
