Their debut album “Welcome Oblivion” was followed by 11 sold out shows of the United States - including two shows at Coachella – and demand for further performances, both in the US and overseas. Added to this innovative visuals from Moment Factory and a performance quickly described by the attendees as “exceptional”, the tour was documented to allow their global fan base a chance to experience the work of this supergroup on the stage.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How To Destroy Angels: Live In Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cVbN8CKpRY6EuycQyYZ4AkpkgS5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2133}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
