They’ll be cycling from Europe's largest Glacier by volume; Vatnajökull, tracing its melt water from source to sea along the Fjöllum river.  Riding nearly 200km, the route takes Lael and Jenny to the most remote and uninhibited part of the island where they are able to witness Iceland's most extraordinary natural wonders up close and personal. They’ll be riding their way across lava fields, passing cascading waterfalls and battling adverse weather whilst tracking the river flow back to civilization on the coast.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sNuMsaOr36SXMfPAd4b7UbLOOMn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iceland: From Glacier To Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iKmBMeUhTEuw3AlE6n3prmWfzzJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sNuMsaOr36SXMfPAd4b7UbLOOMn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ICELAND: FROM GLACIER TO SEA","key":"OiunkCQfWs8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-15T11:57:19.000Z","id":"657244546dc6c000aeb58267"}]}}}
