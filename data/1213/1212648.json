Here he experiments with a new and particularly powerful explosive – an invention that will make him rich and, not least, worthy of marrying the boss’s daughter, Ilse. Unfortunately, the planned test fails, and Saltau is mocked by all the spectators there. Eager to regain his reputation, Saltau foolhardily tries again, but the charge explodes in his hands, blinding him. No longer able to work, he is fired. Yet in a happy turn of events, Saltau is joined by Ilse, who turns her back on her childhood home in favour of an uncertain future with Saltau.
