Indeed, his future looks promising until his father, who is a bookkeeper in the town bank, tells Jørgen that he has embezzled and spent money from the bank. In order to uphold his father’s honour, Jørgen must raise the missing amount, and the only one he knows with that much ready money is his uncle, the canny merchant Ole Konge, whom his father detests. Ole Konge will only help if Jørgen marries his daughter Amalie, who has long pined for her cousin from afar. Sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of his family, Jørgen enters into a loveless marriage. He thinks about Marie every day until a dramatic incident makes him see Amalie in a new light.
