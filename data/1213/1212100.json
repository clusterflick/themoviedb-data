The film retraces not only the development of a unique performance with residents of two nursing homes in California, but also the growth of a sense of community when fifty people from various walks of life, age 65 to 100, join forces to perform together.  Underpinned by Halprinâ€™s conviction that dance and movement embolden people to express themselves and, in so doing, change their lives, the film shows how the participants give physical shape to their personal messages for posterity through a dance performance.","popularity":0.1392,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":129841,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZAS Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2010-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seniors Rocking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Halprin","original_name":"Anna Halprin","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6569dfeaa313b8011bb34523","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60557,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mario Grigorov","original_name":"Mario Grigorov","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6569e03ccf48a100c7c7d79f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruedi Gerber","original_name":"Ruedi Gerber","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/jOjN7AaBGX6QXU7JZMTEO66Csdh.jpg","credit_id":"6569dfffea37e0014ed6f4d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416903,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Adam Teichman","original_name":"Adam Teichman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6569e02471f09500c462b781","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1656743","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mill Valley Film Festival","release_date":"2010-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
