His water drops are a symbol  representing the sad history of Korea and Asia, and they quietly but powerfully resonate with the world through his lifelong works and lives with his family.","popularity":0.116,"poster_path":"/e8yKnDKUMYRkUUnGOTc9syDRvla.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South
