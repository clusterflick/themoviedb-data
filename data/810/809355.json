In the early hours of the 20th January 1945 somewhere over the Adriatic Sea, the Wellington Bomber that 21 year old John was piloting, caught on fire. John made the difficult decision to ditch the plane and have his crew try and escape to a rescue dinghy. They are tested to their emotional and physical limits during the next 71 hours as they try and survive injures, the brutal winter cold and the loss of their dear friend in the crash.  'The Goldfish Club' is an experimental journey into the minds and bodies of those directly affected by war and how people come to cope under extreme stress.  Animated by Isobel Wilson  Music by Nicholas Escobar  Sound by Marco Andreotti  Narrated by Alistair Wilson  Website: isobelwilson.co.uk  Instagram: isobel_animation","popularity":0.3363,"poster_path":"/xPkvUS6OOxEzETCQjlAAJT6j57u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goldfish Club","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3021501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isobel Wilson","original_name":"Isobel Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6059e14947c9fb003e770c6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPkvUS6OOxEzETCQjlAAJT6j57u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":323,"name":"raf (royal air force)"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":249530,"name":"plane crash"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
