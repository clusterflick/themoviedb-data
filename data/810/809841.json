He is left feeling utterly broken and completely cut off from the rest of the world. Carla has left him a sad and angry man and as the days go by, his mind delves from one unsettling extreme to the other - maddening hope to vengeful anger. So much so it just might push him over the edge, and make him do something stupid. Terribly stupid ... all to make her sorry.","popularity":0.1539,"poster_path":"/tXiKuvFNrWr7YcfRm2FxBqOPrnA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antony Spina","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Desperate men do desperate things","title":"Sad Little Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5053723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Mandrides","original_name":"Alexander Mandrides","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Del","credit_id":"673288e14cee4fc8d5d1a12f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5053725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Wynter","original_name":"Mark Wynter","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Craig","credit_id":"673289064cee4fc8d5d1a152","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5053721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antony Spina","original_name":"Antony Spina","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Craig (voice)","credit_id":"67328922a7fdc8608788c195","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":109265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Peters","original_name":"Angela Peters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xubA5glIw5WE6se6nqFAPLgNlx5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Carla","credit_id":"6732896e6895f3822e4613ad","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5053721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antony Spina","original_name":"Antony Spina","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732889f6895f3822e46136a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5053721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antony Spina","original_name":"Antony Spina","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673288af4cee4fc8d5d1a114","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7085168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tXiKuvFNrWr7YcfRm2FxBqOPrnA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
