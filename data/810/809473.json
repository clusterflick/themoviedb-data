The final result was a pentalogy of plays.  This forth play deals with the cause of the war, when a judge from Juazeiro stopped a shipment of wood that was paid for from being delivered for the construction of the New Church of Canudos. Three expeditions were sent by the National Army and defeated, the last one commanded by the famous Colonel Moreira César. The Army faced the humiliation of soldiers deserting and running away, and the impaling of Colonel Tamarindo. He ended up being the main character in a macabre installation on the road to Canudos, created by the Jagunços (thugs from the sertão) and the Mandrakes to intimidate new expeditions.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/vBcv620JwTjyDpCG1PZNUoNZyv3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":362,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Os Sertões: A Luta I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Os Sertões - The Rebellion I","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Sertões: The Struggle I","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Os Sertões - A Luta I","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Celso Martinez Corrêa","original_name":"José Celso Martinez Corrêa","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/oIpfKy1ogWyieE6cxXXcELSK9eE.jpg","credit_id":"605a2d34d5ffcb0056304d4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689601,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Euclides da Cunha","original_name":"Euclides da Cunha","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a2d4470b44400544fa25e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Celso Martinez Corrêa","original_name":"José Celso Martinez Corrêa","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/oIpfKy1ogWyieE6cxXXcELSK9eE.jpg","credit_id":"605a2d26a34911005443a276","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aYoZZC3QJd7oJEEKfn3MHUd8Bof.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uVgHk0q7YJGbtZ0b6AOqnVMMomA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pfixbuTCrUaYGuVGQkUAZ6hJbF8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":855,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBcv620JwTjyDpCG1PZNUoNZyv3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
