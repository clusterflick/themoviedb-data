Miina is an exceptional woman who has done both exceptionally courageous and exceptionally strange deeds. She is passionately hated - but also admired and loved.  At the Skatta farm in Helsinki, Äkkijyrkkä breeds finncattle and fights for the existence of the farm. In addition to conflicts over livestock, Miina’s disagreements with animal welfare authorities and police are escalating. Miina is arrested and her dogs are taken into custody. Miina faces charges about opposing the police and a trial is ahead.  At the same time as Miina is struggling with the authorities, she is building a sculpture of a Holy Cow from car wrecks, which she is erecting in Helsinki's Ruoholahti.","popularity":0.1267,"poster_path":"/ppSAY0WrDyyYaFnbQrhNTYU8pBu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2001-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miinavaara!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3021982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miina Äkkijyrkkä","original_name":"Miina Äkkijyrkkä","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"605a3ab522df2e003c768f35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1481657,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lasse Naukkarinen","original_name":"Lasse Naukkarinen","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a320447c9fb003e777ab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1481657,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lasse Naukkarinen","original_name":"Lasse Naukkarinen","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a323047c9fb003e777afd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1514369,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Timo Peltonen","original_name":"Timo Peltonen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a326322931a003d835262","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1683432,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sakari Rimminen","original_name":"Sakari Rimminen","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a32a9a349110028a41f7c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073818,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tuuli Kuittinen","original_name":"Tuuli Kuittinen","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a3301a294f00069a05ec1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juuso Hirvikangas","original_name":"Juuso Hirvikangas","popularity":0.2225,"profile_path":"/7rvAPTsfz9U2E5tYghfY8YQlZ94.jpg","credit_id":"605a3394fd4f800074be1c69","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3021907,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jorma Harjamäki","original_name":"Jorma Harjamäki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a33a9c9dbf9003dd7f18f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1481657,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lasse Naukkarinen","original_name":"Lasse Naukkarinen","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a33b96bdec3003daea90f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210338,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matti Kuortti","original_name":"Matti Kuortti","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605a33ce47c9fb0053c11eea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1634295","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fi","file_path":"/ppSAY0WrDyyYaFnbQrhNTYU8pBu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
