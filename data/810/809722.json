I wanted this to be my first truly 'positive' film. If Jonas is insanity, then this film is searching for serenity, acceptance and peace.  Also the first film where I truly let go of trying to impress and let all the ideas and influences in. Centering the film—and unusual for myself—is a narrative performance by Lisa Naso that can be read in several ways (since this is a WIP I don't want to give away too much). It is the longest film I've made in 5 years. The archival footage of Jim Hubbard and ACT UP alongside an interview with my professor and activist/scholar/filmmaker Alexandra Juhasz creates anchors that expand conversation of intimacy, care, and community.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/x5ojrz15hiiecxiK0TBM8Wh4rlB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes of a Wind Chime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devon Narine-Singh","original_name":"Devon Narine-Singh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605adc3efd4f8000542950cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x5ojrz15hiiecxiK0TBM8Wh4rlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Prismatic Ground Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
