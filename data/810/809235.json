Ricardo Mosner exists, but his character transcends the documentary world. We also see musician Daniel Melingo, the film’s director and co-star, transformed into a ghostly vagabond in the city. The camera captures these specters’ roaming like images of a digital canvas. There is wine, loneliness, parties and sunrises of bourgeois bohemians. The film encrypts its indomitable value in exposing how you can paint an audiovisual picture under the influence of this century’s events and variations. In the end, the film is an act of combining brushes and colors with precision in order to depict a happy reunion in exile.","popularity":0.16,"poster_path":"/acpAmD4dZvJWwsggTKj1kN5Osbz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mosner’s
