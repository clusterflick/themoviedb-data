Why did the bodies of the women and children killed here had to be cremated two years after this massacre - after these bodies were disinterred by army units - in the crematorium of the also Moravian city of Olomouc? Why didn't the Czech historian, who investigated the fate of the slaughtered Hungarian and German families and who also fought for the last honors to be paid to them, receive no praise or medal from Budapest? And what was the fate of the 90 Hungarian leventes handed over to the soldiers of the Slovak army by the soldiers of the Soviet army occupying Austria at Ligetfalu below Bratislava? This documentary explores the story of two hitherto unexplored mass murder in Pronov and Bratislava in the village of Bratislava.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":"/rlREeT7o8lGubpMcK1reypsePBi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Becsengetünk Produkció Kft.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Népirtás Pozsonyligetfalun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Epres Attila","original_name":"Epres Attila","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/osSLwS232MwGghOItITV9pHZuDV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"605afaa4fd4f8000542965ab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoltán Udvardy","original_name":"Zoltán Udvardy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605afb33a6c10400289d344e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoltán Udvardy","original_name":"Zoltán Udvardy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605afb0ea34911006b6daf1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dávid Géczy","original_name":"Dávid Géczy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605afae847c9fb0053c23eb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fruzsina Skrabski","original_name":"Fruzsina Skrabski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605afb5dd37197007681e6df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13532712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":841,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/rlREeT7o8lGubpMcK1reypsePBi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
