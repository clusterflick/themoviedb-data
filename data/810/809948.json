The unfolding imagery is fugitive but insistent and suggests moments that have been lost, erased, or buried, and also suggests the urgency of memory in the face of disappearance. The imagery is constantly in play; as soon as the bigger picture becomes visible it seems to slip away. In the soundtrack, (inspired by Alvin Lucier’s I Am Sitting in a Room), the generational decay becomes stronger than the original melody. This piece is as much about what gets lost through re-telling as it is about the ever-lingering echo of past voices that constantly surrounds us in what may sound like white noise.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tzdgHGoA7hzT4Ynxap5Ms1ETYHk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assembly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1682228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheri Wills","original_name":"Sheri Wills","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vlqQdNqz6bMTzVIH6bSRswsUAQY.jpg","credit_id":"605b8cd070b444005456eb57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzdgHGoA7hzT4Ynxap5Ms1ETYHk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
