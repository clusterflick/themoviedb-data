Jeff Williams is the father of Andy, who in 2001, at the age of 15, shot and killed two classmates and wounded 13 other students. Andy, 25 at the time of filming, is now serving life in prison. Clarence Elliot’s son Nicholas shot and killed his teacher and wounded another in 1988. He too is serving life in prison. Sue Klebold’s son Dylan was one of the two teenagers behind the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, one of the deadliest school shootings in history. Dylan ended the shooting by committing suicide. Through the three parents' deeply personal stories and raw, honest testimony, the film explores multiple themes that emerge from terrible tragedies - guilt, failure, responsibility, sorrow, friendship and love.","popularity":0.1194,"poster_path":"/xYJs6bFbARTI8uUR5Ez5w5G4Q4q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":50510,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Storyville","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raising a School Shooter","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Eltern eines Amokläufers","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Parents de tueurs","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Williams","original_name":"Jeff Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6572dbffcaab6d010b0fba51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3187949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Klebold","original_name":"Sue Klebold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6572dc0c55bc3500c5de6ea3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4419231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Elliot","original_name":"Clarence Elliot","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6572dc18945c2000ea4f108a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1401439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frida Barkfors","original_name":"Frida Barkfors","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6058f08b0792e1003d63dbf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lasse Barkfors","original_name":"Lasse Barkfors","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6058f09ca294f000530f7d8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14515216","wikidata_id":"Q76942231","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ci9BSg4z43820fJE7QaHvQfBPXM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rbDa53bzBjMpkDGc46tuNnRyQQV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":2362,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xYJs6bFbARTI8uUR5Ez5w5G4Q4q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1693}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Movistar +","release_date":"2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Raising a School Shooter trailer | CPH:DOX 2021","key":"Wdqyy_S-CUM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-24T07:28:44.000Z","id":"60dd5af49974ee005e87e948"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Raising a School Shooter - trailer","key":"540121469","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-22T12:07:44.000Z","id":"60dd6b22ef9d72007e08af5e"}]}}}
