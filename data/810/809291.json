Porridge pulleys and Pi poses the question: how do we get first-rate research mathematicians? Hendrik lenstra and Vaughan Jones have had an extraordinary impact on mathematics; this charming documentary gives the viewer a taste of their personalities, mathematical and otherwise. A whirlwind tour of knots, geonomics, cryptography, music, Homer, elliptic curves, art, and windsurfing, the video contains sections on the history of Pi, and a suprising discovery involving a cocoa tin and an Escher print.","popularity":0.0851,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"porridge pulleys and Pi: two mathematical journeys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3021253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vaughan Jones","original_name":"Vaughan Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60597884d5ffcb00562fa220","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hendrik Lenstra","original_name":"Hendrik Lenstra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6059788e5c071b007574c16b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Paul Csicsery","original_name":"George Paul Csicsery","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6059789ea294f000699faa54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1543677","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
