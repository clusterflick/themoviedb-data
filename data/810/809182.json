One day the villagers discover a shower cubicle on a deserted barren land of Rajasthan. Immediately the word spreads in the entire village and the villagers gather in-front of the cubicle to drink and store water. The mere joy among the villagers were well portrayed throughout the film and the voice over backs it up by saying “While the entire village fulfilled their thirst, an urban man’s shower is still not over” – making us question the amount of water we waste on a daily basis while we go in for a quick shower.","popularity":0.1239,"poster_path":"/tjhQMknMS7Mu8yVtm4S0AywpOIi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Lamb Films Pvt.
