Today, facing a terminal illness, she will travel to her country of birth, Peru and through Europe revisiting all the important places and moments of her life, richly illustrated with clips of her films.  Is it a farewell journey in which she lets go of her family, her loved ones and her work? Or is it a celebration of life? Her travelling companion is taxi driver Hussein, a refugee from Iraq with whom Heddy has a tight bond. As they trace Heddy’s family history they find many common themes. They are no longer taxi driver and customer, but two souls who each find joy in life in the face of adversity. It is a life affirming film about universal connection and comfort.","popularity":0.1241,"poster_path":"/aznQnBNgaCXjHWhhekiSaO6FBOL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Hay Camino","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"605abc4cc9dbf9007360cbac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pieter van Huijstee","original_name":"Pieter van Huijstee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605abc5bd3719700560f7a1a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristien Hemmerechts","original_name":"Kristien Hemmerechts","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611c85c5ac4161005cdae7d7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":569203,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florencia Di Concilio","original_name":"Florencia Di Concilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611c85ff2e0697004598d6ac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adri Schrover","original_name":"Adri Schrover","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611c85d2151c5c004619564f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3202101,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jesica de Koning","original_name":"Jesica de Koning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611c85df87f3f200756aa1ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666962,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ruben van der Hammen","original_name":"Ruben van der Hammen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611c85f087f3f2002c35bf1c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"611c85bb2e069700735385a9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15452160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aznQnBNgaCXjHWhhekiSaO6FBOL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1666},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1498,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A8rtoZBK1y08r810ZLMQWTyyAce.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ACLAMADAS | No hay camino","key":"L2cBBYilyL8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-02T19:21:20.000Z","id":"611c8623e54d5d002680816e"}]}}}
