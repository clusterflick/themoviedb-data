Their wanderings are an opportunity to highlight the many tourist and picturesque places on the Algerian coast. This film commissioned by the Defense Communication and Audiovisual Production Establishment (ECPAD), attempts to sell a tourist destination when Algeria was in flames with the outbreak of the Algerian national liberation war. Filmed with the colonial lens of the time, the natives are only one element of a picturesque setting, and the final kiss between a French woman and an Arab man is an attempt to demonstrate a pacified country. Despite everything, the film constitutes a precious archive for Béjaïa, which is the subject for the first time of a film which immortalizes a moment in its history, and to introduce the work of Tahar Hannache, actor, cinematographer and director, one of the pioneers of Algerian cinema.","popularity":0.1208,"poster_path":"/mQaaEVv4qI7DIkuUOffMOGgah6b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123263,"logo_path":"/lH6LuTXRNVncmI4fJwohv2FqgpO.png","name":"ECPAD","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":237850,"logo_path":"/9MNNwW7qsIDoEVQ0MnvI06ox0Hm.png","name":"Francol Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Corniche d'Amour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyne Corman","original_name":"Evelyne Corman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/t9eR3vfkb2vjSabZaVeUyr89QvJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66d458014d35df9c44658ba9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Ravene","original_name":"Monique Ravene","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66d458403c03b3f987b0a465","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Noguéro","original_name":"José Noguéro","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/yst8g2bBcTqcjmSbrVaeAvCbRJ8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66d4584df30a7b3c8003f558","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Francoux","original_name":"Jean Francoux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d457bff30a7b3c8003f54f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618830,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georges Tzipine","original_name":"Georges Tzipine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d457cdbf9c4462cc9bc869","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1894936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Djamel-Eddine Chanderli","original_name":"Djamel-Eddine Chanderli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/v1gne4rToLWFEE45fdhCwAi7zqU.jpg","credit_id":"66d457e682fccbc40c03f45a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3397774,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tahar Hannache","original_name":"Tahar Hannache","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/bTo2mnbPfrVOwvpI5kaRuhiLlQy.jpg","credit_id":"66d457db4827b3abd818052d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33309527","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qys5GxoZhArDf0wR9NYvZsYaFnR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mQaaEVv4qI7DIkuUOffMOGgah6b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":293660,"name":"kabylie, algeria"},{"id":337081,"name":"bejaïa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
