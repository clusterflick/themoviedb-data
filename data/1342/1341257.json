He finds himself increasingly isolated as he battles to reconnect with his wife, Nadiia, and their three sons, Sasha, Artem and Nikita. The film takes an unexpected turn when Serhiy turns the camera on its director. This role reversal creates a space for vulnerable dialogue about love and human relationships as the filmmaker shares her own experience of break-up with another war veteran.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":"/32Qkhu4BewHFtkWqEvUXCDF2FYw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petnaesta Umjetnost","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":239696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drama Free Film Production","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2024-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dad's Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Tatova kolyskova","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4001848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesia Diak","original_name":"Lesia Diak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d2317cf459fa77e503c210","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4001848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesia Diak","original_name":"Lesia Diak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d2311845fd225553964943","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2000656,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrei Gorgan","original_name":"Andrei Gorgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d233596e97953b05943ba9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4001848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesia Diak","original_name":"Lesia Diak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d23250c6120336dc6a584d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21811692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/32Qkhu4BewHFtkWqEvUXCDF2FYw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sarajevo Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dharamshala International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
