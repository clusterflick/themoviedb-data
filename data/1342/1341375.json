Lush tall grasses, scrubby brush, and an abundance of watering holes attract a vast array of big game and smaller wildlife to this lowland valley. Yet during the lean winter months, before the great migration of wildebeest and zebra, the resident lions live on the edge of starvation. Everything rides on the success or failure of a few critical hunts. The fate of the young cubs hangs in the balance as the bond that holds the pride together is stretched to the limit. Now enter the domain of Kali the lion and her pride as they face the daily challenge to survive on the African plains","popularity":0.4711,"poster_path":"/oJ25B6FAHmGrVTSEMXzpJyBMCVI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kali the Lion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245546,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Page","original_name":"George Page","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/fS7jA2pWLlK4E9QbVA0tBddxyeT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Host (Narrator)","credit_id":"66e1c93f6bf9608d62118c14","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon King","original_name":"Simon King","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/4xyh4wX3m3AskNWc5YJuNRVuDN7.jpg","credit_id":"66d293c1899a92e2b7b07d92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon King","original_name":"Simon King","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/4xyh4wX3m3AskNWc5YJuNRVuDN7.jpg","credit_id":"66d2939af0c0401630c0d1a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon King","original_name":"Simon King","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/4xyh4wX3m3AskNWc5YJuNRVuDN7.jpg","credit_id":"66d293acac52e3192fb16b5c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4147244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oJ25B6FAHmGrVTSEMXzpJyBMCVI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2043,"name":"lion"},{"id":251493,"name":"big cats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"\"Nature\"","release_date":"1991-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
