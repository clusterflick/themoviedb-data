Inspector Fudge is called to investigate the case. As he examines the scene and interviews witnesses, the trail unexpectedly leads him to the Markingham family, owners of a major manufacturing conglomerate.  Initially, the connection between the shooting and the Markinghams seems tenuous. However, as Fudge delves deeper into their business dealings and personal lives, he discovers a web of corporate secrets, rivalries, and hidden agendas. His investigation reveals links between the shooting and a high-stakes industrial espionage scheme involving the Markinghams' company.  The more Fudge uncovers, the clearer it becomes that the shooting might be just the tip of the iceberg. With each twist and turn, the case grows more complex, suggesting that the motivations behind the crime are far more elaborate and dangerous than anyone initially anticipated.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":237856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albrecht Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Nobody Has a Clue","title":"Clue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asher Albrecht","original_name":"Asher Albrecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Inspector Fudge","credit_id":"66d48c660229c4941e78f32f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asher Albrecht","original_name":"Asher Albrecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bobby Markingham","credit_id":"66d48fbe5fdc67fbfec0f5bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Schram","original_name":"Nate Schram","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dean Yeshenbogan","credit_id":"66d48fdc7740f123d70073f6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asher Albrecht","original_name":"Asher Albrecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d49014a6965075d0cb567f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4917076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asher Albrecht","original_name":"Asher Albrecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d490259b26114fe101fa14","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
