A hunter’s voice from the past shares a dream with his wife in which wild animals seek revenge on him, placing into question how everyday life will be lived in their future. While the couple’s human drama unfolds, nature remains unphased, time and the river moving forward – or is it backwards? This film was made in the Amazon Jungle, Peru, during PlayLab Films’ Director’s Lab with Apichatpong Weerasethakul.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/lsNLS0pgAcfF2aWFzLF6qdRYK0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2024-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mitayero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915343,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivria Dubs","original_name":"Ivria Dubs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d336347c1bb47a11a806cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Vinen","original_name":"Kate Vinen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d33613b6c634c8e8b60ae2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622353,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Mendolicchio","original_name":"Jonathan Mendolicchio","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d33669a658ab22ebb60e64","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919844,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yanni Kronenberg","original_name":"Yanni Kronenberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d33685de7b8414a9ae0942","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2159998,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Estephania Bonnett Alonso","original_name":"Estephania Bonnett Alonso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d33622735842496cb609b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Vinen","original_name":"Kate Vinen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d33606ac52e3192fb17124","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Vinen","original_name":"Kate Vinen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3363f1906d2bed3a80442","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103330,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elliott Magen","original_name":"Elliott Magen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d336590229c4941e78d3b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Vinen","original_name":"Kate Vinen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d335b9a3c995702a457811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32864383","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1529,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lsNLS0pgAcfF2aWFzLF6qdRYK0b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1035}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Slow Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
