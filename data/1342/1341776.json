More faithful to the original spirit of the comic than the first Spider-man they shot in 1993, this short replaces the experimental style of the first with more humor and drops of terror. Filmed with very little budget, much of it went to make the hero's black alien costume and a life-size replica of Venom's head.","popularity":0.1112,"poster_path":"/fG16XLHifP7dAiIzedNH0O3G6AF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Parker es Spider-Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chema Ponze","original_name":"Chema Ponze","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Peter Parker / Spider-Man","credit_id":"66d430774d35df9c44658a0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cels Pi침ol","original_name":"Cels Pi침ol","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"66d4308acc962cf9e965875e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2843273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nando Dixkontrol","original_name":"Nando Dixkontrol","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ladr칩n","credit_id":"66d430a2a79ddc5fac458dc8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga de Diego","original_name":"Olga de Diego","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mary Jane","credit_id":"66d430cec434ba383a180444","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chema Ponze","original_name":"Chema Ponze","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d430ea95e7a36e614cc538","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chema Ponze","original_name":"Chema Ponze","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d43107046a9b366cc0f4d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chema Ponze","original_name":"Chema Ponze","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d43123c18bcb252f006f0d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naxo Fiol","original_name":"Naxo Fiol","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/pFNAZTVWTA28o4wBAYuMlrBET9S.jpg","credit_id":"66d4313ecedf21ce2e6a8b32","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3987312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Llorente","original_name":"Norman Llorente","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d4316013231a658201ed6d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8085826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fG16XLHifP7dAiIzedNH0O3G6AF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1996-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
