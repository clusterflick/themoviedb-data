Leary and A. Huxley, documents the effects of psychotropic substances on the human mind. In collaboration with engineer Norsen, Dr. Kanudo invents a machine capable of visualizing mental images. The scientist's goal is to document, in a mirrored manner, the mental experience under the influence of ketamine, a substance known for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. Dr. Kanudo agrees to have the experiment filmed. The filmmaker also takes on the task of finding two patients to take ketamine and attends a rave party, where he documents the use of the substance in such gatherings. Meanwhile, in the laboratory, everything is progressing well until an unexpected reaction from the second patient to the administration of the drug and a raid by the authorities threaten to derail the situation.","popularity":0.0736,"poster_path":"/3JCezZtngbnXcyFTLWiUMRHIkbG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KomaK","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Grifi","original_name":"Alberto Grifi","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/6lrwzkOd2KFn1syLyhxJaSLejxe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66d1d71c294f933dd901b7df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759778,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Danilo Monte","original_name":"Danilo Monte","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66d1d8c17b5524fd9f0fd684","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4913345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zucco","original_name":"Zucco","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66d1d8c64d1c3e4c8996466f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759778,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Danilo Monte","original_name":"Danilo Monte","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1d7064c59aca41db5f6c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danilo Monte","original_name":"Danilo Monte","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1d883cedf21ce2e6a55f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4913345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zucco","original_name":"Zucco","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1d8966e37048c74b06bd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4913345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zucco","original_name":"Zucco","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1d8a040190671b1b15597","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191179,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alessio Valori","original_name":"Alessio Valori","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1d8d5b6c634c8e8b5f2c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4913348,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Valentina Bersiga","original_name":"Valentina Bersiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1d8df845738f65694397e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4913349,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Luca Scaffidi","original_name":"Luca Scaffidi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1d8e96c421ddc346a5600","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3JCezZtngbnXcyFTLWiUMRHIkbG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Komak - 2002 - Danilo Monte & Zucco","key":"mE9Qh4Wkj-o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-22T08:41:13.000Z","id":"66d1d741bd4f25adff78b71a"}]}}}
