This archetype is the highest idealization of the male character in Dominican and Caribbean culture. Alberto is the head coach of this camp who decides that Pablo’s time has come to join the group. But Pablo, his son, is a Tiguere in his own right, unbeknownst to Alberto, whose coming-of-age process clashes with his father’s authoritarian views. This leads Pablo on a journey of self-discovery.","popularity":0.2659,"poster_path":"/tmFY5XwAbpKEOJUcwp99Qyt5md4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiger","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny Perez","original_name":"Manny Perez","popularity":0.482,"profile_path":"/auDXIA7COAJkgPFYlZWAvCuezRG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66f4e31838942ab890ed3449","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Fernández","original_name":"Carlos Fernández","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66f4e3294f949c7a5c47c2a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1891869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Santana","original_name":"Camila Santana","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/rPi6xweYMPCp6bb0dz5D2jHrFyG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66f4e334e14a3c8e6273d7b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daga Gautreau","original_name":"Daga Gautreau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66f4e33c38942ab890ed346a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José María Cabral","original_name":"José María Cabral","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d305dfb9d5ef5047ae0804","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":989743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arturo Arango","original_name":"Arturo Arango","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e771bf2c621807dbb13e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José María Cabral","original_name":"José María Cabral","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e7724f2c621807dbb13ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3639641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nurielis Duarte","original_name":"Nurielis Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e772e12667968854e6a2b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alán González","original_name":"Alán González","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679c4ef816ff832e57bdd8e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3045397,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xenia Rivery","original_name":"Xenia Rivery","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679c4f03822e7d32f7bddd92","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129834,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hernan Herrera","original_name":"Hernan Herrera","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679c4f1516ff832e57bdd8e5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29619842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1544,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fDU8HhPX6kGtmQKMEQPQvLfwIKJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2745}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tmFY5XwAbpKEOJUcwp99Qyt5md4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/94L9mCbcpHzir11SIzWpejeV76G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Mostra de São Paulo","release_date":"2024-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tiguere (Tiger) - Trailer subtitled in English","key":"XTZzPIHt2R0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-01-20T16:44:49.000Z","id":"679c4e69134f488161011634"}]}}}
