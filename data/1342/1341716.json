His broadly drawn themes of small town hypocrisy and restrictive moral values contextualize the titular characters' struggle for sexual expression, stability and independence. Certain Women is a disconcerting parable that pays tribute to but also defies the 50s period style of Caldwell, opting for contemporary small town situations and cinematic style. This cautionary tale of four heroic yet ordinary women is fashioned out of the past but relies on observations of the present historical moment and its political reality.","popularity":0.2179,"poster_path":"/a3WzU4wJgAviXfsEjBLpJXbhniM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Certain Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3510740,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendi Weger","original_name":"Wendi Weger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Clementine","credit_id":"66d3ebb6538f19e764582905","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Meijer Torr","original_name":"Martina Meijer Torr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Louellen","credit_id":"66d3ebe4d9ada2cde64cc297","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Watson","original_name":"Jessica Watson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hilda","credit_id":"66d3ec0fb9d5ef5047ae25d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phoebe Reilly","original_name":"Phoebe Reilly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nannette","credit_id":"66d3ec34f0b71dde6a65883a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hutton","original_name":"Peter Hutton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":"/qWXyXftCSJSaJE6UIeQpLTn8L9g.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Clementine's Dad","credit_id":"66d3ed5436c272646b0068ce","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfas Mekas","original_name":"Adolfas Mekas","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/q5nHzCDUVHiUA7vWaB0bptF2ovR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hilda's Papa","credit_id":"66d3ed7d40190671b1b18d5e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peggy Ahwesh","original_name":"Peggy Ahwesh","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/2PpqxpTqv2HN5yQMusOQCcZly4l.jpg","credit_id":"66d3eb97a3c995702a45924d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobby Abate","original_name":"Bobby Abate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3eb8a4027951b14cb51a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83238,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erskine Caldwell","original_name":"Erskine Caldwell","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3ec9b911cf65d3f78eaea","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobby Abate","original_name":"Bobby Abate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e215f1516821b3399070b4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peggy Ahwesh","original_name":"Peggy Ahwesh","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/2PpqxpTqv2HN5yQMusOQCcZly4l.jpg","credit_id":"66e21600f6affa2a0d7b667e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0402095","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1670,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a3WzU4wJgAviXfsEjBLpJXbhniM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
