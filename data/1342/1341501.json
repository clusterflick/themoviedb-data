Taking its title from a famous aria in Mozartâ€™s The Magic Flute, which has been performed by countless parrots on YouTube, it probes some of the ways in which the camera is used to reduce real animals to abstract objects for human pleasure and knowledge. Through cinema, animals are at our disposal, yet kept safely at a distance, deepening artificial boundaries between human and non-human, nature and culture, and wilderness and civilization.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gYBNpNt6CiMVie5Q8YRbyKlmS28.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destroyed Be Forever All the Bonds of Nature","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shelby Prichard","original_name":"Shelby Prichard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d337f9c18bcb252f0051b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shelby Prichard","original_name":"Shelby Prichard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d33826de9e844993c0d989","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1528,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gYBNpNt6CiMVie5Q8YRbyKlmS28.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1023}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Slow Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
