Mercury is poured upon its base until the whole surface is covered in a layer of the metal, the thickness of which is established on the cohesiveness of the mercury itself, the liquid with the greatest surface tension. Once poured, the metal acts like a skin that picks up vibrations from the ground and the air while a spotlight transfers these surface waves onto the wall making them visible. The whole piece is simply supported to show the properties of the material.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7TIUTmzF1Hr4hWKXC4g45unkOiv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1983-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video documentation of the piece Metal, by Eva Lootz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Lootz","original_name":"Eva Lootz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66d3393865e8b4fff8ae0c07","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Domingo Sarrey","original_name":"Domingo Sarrey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3394df28dbeb3e5a808d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7TIUTmzF1Hr4hWKXC4g45unkOiv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1983-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
