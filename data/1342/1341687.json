What ends up being a simple premise ends up becoming macabre very quickly… but then, as it goes on, turns into something else. Something otherwordly, sublime even. The nature of life itself — nostalgia through the images, the smiling and laughing, little kids picking their noses… all can be undone by an accident, or by disease, or addiction. Rice hits on something very delicate and profound here, it’ll open a chasm in your soul.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Movielegy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Bex Rice","original_name":"Sarah Bex Rice","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3bfc886804469424cb942","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
