They move from attraction to attraction with their guide maps and their cameras, completely unaware of what lies just beneath their feet. What they don’t know is that the earth below the city holds a labyrinth of secrets, a series of phenomena both natural and man-made that can explain why Rome has flourished for so long.  Join Dr. Michael Scott as he returns to Rome seeking answers to many of the questions often asked by those who inhabit or visit the city: What’s the secret to Rome’s longevity? How has it passed the many tests of time while others crumbled under the same pressures?  Is the foundation of the city strong enough to withstand a future of non-stop development and growth?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rome's Buried Secrets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
