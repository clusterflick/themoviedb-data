Through powerful testimonies from former detainees, victims' families, and experts, along with archival footage, animations, and emotional recreations, the film pieces together the intricate puzzle of evidence that confirms the regime's brutal methods of murder and forced disappearance. Key moments featured include the discovery of the body of French nun Leonnie Duquet, the infiltration of military officer Alfredo Astiz into the Madres de Plaza de Mayo group, and an interview with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Adolfo Pérez Esquivel. The documentary also highlights the significant event of a plane used in the \"Death Flights\" returning to Argentina in 2023, serving as a poignant reminder of this dark chapter in history.","popularity":0.1162,"poster_path":"/gFTRBahEIGxc3iz9Y0bL1yXhrVu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Traslados\" is a documentary of the \"Death Flights\" during Argentina's dictatorship (1976-1983), featuring testimonies, archival material, and key moments, including the return of a plane used in these flights.","title":"Transfers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1091848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás Gil Lavedra","original_name":"Nicolás Gil Lavedra","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/r3dWMmNCHufguAGxbX181lL96HE.jpg","credit_id":"66d231255a8a9e5e2dc0c028","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1672786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Hochbaum","original_name":"Zoe Hochbaum","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/w5GW5E3N2cAwuPEiqs7dfanGCJE.jpg","credit_id":"66d2314b3c381a51b9c0bfe3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Gersberg","original_name":"Gustavo Gersberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d23134cb12413a2c9b90e4","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1672786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Hochbaum","original_name":"Zoe Hochbaum","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/w5GW5E3N2cAwuPEiqs7dfanGCJE.jpg","credit_id":"66d2316238adc2a72c003a8d","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2246501,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Santiago Parysow","original_name":"Santiago Parysow","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d2316f9b26114fe101be5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33306496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2834,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gFTRBahEIGxc3iz9Y0bL1yXhrVu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"+13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRASLADOS Teaser","key":"J-bBICGe4ec","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-21T14:01:54.000Z","id":"66d231d7520ab9d72f9645e5"}]}}}
