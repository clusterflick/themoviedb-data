When Tye returns to work, he learns that the FBI is planning to take over the case in 3 days and transfer the sole suspect, Dale Howard Osbourne, to Washington to be tried in federal court. It seems obvious to Tye that Dale didn't do it and couldn't have done it, but he has to produce the evidence to prove Dale's innocence in order to get his Chief to stand up to the FBI and refuse to surrender the prisoner. At the same time, there is a drama in Tye's home life concerning a secret that he and his wife Mariela have been keeping from their only child, their daughter Kayla.â€”Ralph Cinque","popularity":0.3819,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bitter End Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Days or Else","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3789662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickeal Freeland","original_name":"Mickeal Freeland","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Detective Tyrell Banks","credit_id":"66d238c57ff3979084964a3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4914177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawntell Anderson","original_name":"Shawntell Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mariela Banks","credit_id":"66d238cdbf9c4462cc9b910f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4877180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael A.
