The ironic and poetic narrative of writer and visual artist Pedro Lemebel is present in this documentary journey proposed by Verónica Quense. Through some chronicles read from Radio Tierra, it is possible to enter into urban geographies where the so hackneyed “marginality” becomes an urgent and revitalized political manifesto in the presence of three women who unite on the issue of human rights. Thus, gender, writing, sex, music, and politics trace a historical trace from Havana, Santiago, Cartagena, and Pisagua.","popularity":0.2109,"poster_path":"/bRTBsxkumU5ytzoQUD3nPo45SdX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pedro Lemebel: Corazón en Fuga","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verónica Quense","original_name":"Verónica Quense","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6736a5bb6bd4889bfbc79329","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verónica Quense","original_name":"Verónica Quense","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6736a5e548e9d2cf01a8944e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5622314","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pEZ2qot3U2EkNIKfeMSS4Qud43b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bRTBsxkumU5ytzoQUD3nPo45SdX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":254152,"name":"trans activism"},{"id":345747,"name":"biographical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
