Thirteen years later, he has completed a Quadruple Badwater and broken a world record for running rim to rim through the Grand Canyon seven times. Now about to turn 60, Bill returns for his eighth attempt at Arrowhead 135, one of the toughest cold-weather endurance races in the world, and for his second attempt at Aconcagua, the highest summit in the Southern and Western Hemisphere. As Bill pushes beyond his limits, he questions whether finishing these events defines his identity - or if he can discover a deeper reason for being out in the arena.","popularity":0.1865,"poster_path":"/1A9vfXYEDSsHXbcNmlnovwjtCau.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Wrap
