While in the process of completing it, I used single frame digital animation to shoot the faces and their sudden transformations when subjected to the photo-finish technique, transferring them, then imparting motion to them in a single animated sequence on the computer. This agitation, torn from photographic fixity [is] subjected, in turn, to distortion by its intersection with objects texture-mapped with those same faces. The passage from motionless quiet to paroxysmal interference; the animating startle of Bach’s cello.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/kVeXKnA7pNRxEEongdDnGi46nQZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volto telato","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Gioli","original_name":"Paolo Gioli","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/mA2Q0SwP0Wk56hRNNCQDeKNSFdE.jpg","credit_id":"66d219d6a30b65b48203bfa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kVeXKnA7pNRxEEongdDnGi46nQZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
