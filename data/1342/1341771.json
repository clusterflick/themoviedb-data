This is the first film made in Spain, shot without more budget than the spent in the costume of the hero (60,000 pesetas of 1993) and shot with a video-8 camera of the time, so the image and the sound, together with the passage of time make the quality of both very poor. Halfway between the experimental, psychotronic cinema and avant-garde cinema, it´s a very extravagant version of the character, softened in the second incursion of the Trauma Group in the character: \"Peter Parker is Spider-Man\" (1996), closer than this to the original comic.","popularity":0.5624,"poster_path":"/lvXFC3xpMdaIqjFMVEfjpSrelPm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spider-Man!","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chema
