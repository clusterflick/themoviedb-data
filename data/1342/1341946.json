Hard-luck Paul, recently out of a job and rudely dumped by his girlfriend, has to sell his car in order to pay his rent. Lying around in a depressed fog, he is contacted out of the blue by an old friend, Freddie, a mysterious man ineptly obsessed with all things Asian. He has come to town to conduct some kind of quasi-legal business transaction he is convinced will leave him wealthy. As Paul learns more about the scheme, he becomes inexorably involved until he has to put everything on the line.","popularity":0.5061,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":237859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stall Ten
