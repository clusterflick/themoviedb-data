Their long journey must be so bizarre! The problem approaches them and how Crow & Ryoko will handle this situation.  A Crow_Se7en film. In association with Helping Hands. Filmed in VRChat. This movie doesn't affiliate with VRChat. We worked on this project for fun.  This is a DEAF movie so be mindful, it doesn't necessarily have the sounds all the time. It has some songs, sound effects, and a few voice lines.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eHiQd6krnW9S9qnQz9eccGNV1jv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Crow & Ryoko got lost in many universes and meet their multiversal variants.","title":"Lost In The Metaverse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2352,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHiQd6krnW9S9qnQz9eccGNV1jv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
