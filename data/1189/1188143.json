Filmmaker Deborah Kerr and her crew were filming a day in the life of a newspaper when the company unraveled and its owners sold the 121-year-old institution to a longtime local competitor, thus ending the bay areaâ€™s newspaper war and decades-long careers for hundreds of reporters, photographers, editors and pressmen. In the film, viewers will hear from former newspaper employees about the stark reality of what is happening in the newspaper industry, and its effect on the more than 600 employees whose lives were changed forever by the closing of this Tampa landmark and the readers left bereft of community news when the Tribune stopped hitting their driveways.","popularity":0.0533,"poster_path":"/evNTAkz9ovWZc3x8KLX7DhiIepX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stop the Presses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Kerr","original_name":"Deborah Kerr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652028e75b1240013c7cd351","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/evNTAkz9ovWZc3x8KLX7DhiIepX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
