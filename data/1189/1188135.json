One of the leading cast members is the pianist and composer Myint Thu. He has composed the song 'Mon Shwe Yee' for Mon which makes her a famous star. The song, praising the beauty and fragrance of the flower 'Mon Shwee Yee', is a hidden declaration of love, but in 'real' life Myint Thu behaves with rather more reservation, strictness and coldness. He is a man incapable of showing his feelings. The mutual attraction is never admitted openly, and his love for Mon becomes a real problem when a new admirer shows up. Ye Aung, an officer and Myint Thu's old school friend, falls in love with Mon when he first sees her on stage.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"1970-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":162,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mon Shwe Yee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3178862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Win Oo","original_name":"Win Oo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652024abc50ad2010b0148a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0066091","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
