It was a time of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia and thus also a time of beautiful visons and desires. In 1969, the film was banned. Jan Spata came back to his \"Greatest Wish\" in 1990 and created a feature documentary comparing that period with the 1989 events. He even found some people interviewed in 1964 and asked them to speak again, now being 25 years older.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/vnVCtqJz049dUdcpMcM3k6RXo8G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Wish 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Špáta","original_name":"Jan Špáta","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65207285c50ad200eac1c9e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0263783","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":722,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOc6So5hhYZuT25E0bScAUHjQGB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1283}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vnVCtqJz049dUdcpMcM3k6RXo8G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":732}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
