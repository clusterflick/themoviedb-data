Her parents couldn’t accept it—refusing to seek treatment for their sick child, they confined her to their house, to the point of even fixing a padlock on the front door to lock her in. Her younger brother, suspicious of his parents’ actions, began filming the family in an effort to openly question them. A family conflict that lasted over twenty years.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/bCIkCxbwpE5lOLvslkgf63Nxf4D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199672,"logo_path":null,"name":"TOFOO FILMS, LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":240133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zou-shima","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Should We Have Done?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"我們到底做了什麼？","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4311903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fujino Tomoaki","original_name":"Fujino Tomoaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65233fa8fd630000ad9eab7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1dqJn5aYX4jZgHV0OmQzGsTVu30.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1557,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c8FGrKIlnSueEfOo6gcbIHLjG9D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2768}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/bCIkCxbwpE5lOLvslkgf63Nxf4D.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1999,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/RCNWQLub2a88KulDKADcpbqm8w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":41329,"name":"mental illness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
