Their strategy is unorthodox. They take on fentanyl, the most lethal drug on the planet, through fitness. Fueled by the energy and community of Dale's gym, we follow the town's comeback through the lens of one woman's recovery. Small Town Strong is a story that's evolved over 4 years.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/lYSmzltS4SKcG7f849u7uzUxZjv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Town Strong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4310126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chase Millsap","original_name":"Chase Millsap","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6521b4280cb33516f6398ec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3799019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Spencer Millsap","original_name":"Spencer Millsap","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6521b43aea84c7012d6b4d0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27910119","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1126,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lYSmzltS4SKcG7f849u7uzUxZjv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
