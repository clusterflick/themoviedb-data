Devised as a live performance and film-making event, a mutually responsive collage of movement, music, and arresting visuals tells their story of grit, tenacity, and perseverance through harsh social and environmental conditions. The film’s experimental design explores the tensions between liveness, mediatization, and the ability of technology to reveal novel performance experiences.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue Healey","original_name":"Sue Healey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651fe08907216600acb78570","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco Dance Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
