Zero-tolerance policies are used to justify suspension and arrests that set up a pathway to send children of color and children with special needs from school to prison. Children are being suspended, restrained, dragged, physically manhandled, and subsequently arrested for minor offenses such as throwing candy on a school bus. These personal accounts from people affected by the school-to-prison pipeline give riveting tales about the generational impact on society.","popularity":1.9452,"poster_path":"/b5Vr5TYxELlkBi9bCdDqMj3LieI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Preschool to Prison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dr. Karen Baptiste","original_name":"Dr. Karen Baptiste","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6520a120ea84c700aeed41e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Vulcain","original_name":"Tiffany Vulcain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6520a13a74507d00c57b3d21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pia Johnson","original_name":"Pia Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6520a1420cb335011b1b7043","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Nohavicka","original_name":"Joseph Nohavicka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6520a14c74507d00ac48d819","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taso Pardalis","original_name":"Taso Pardalis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6520a154ea84c700ca0b3829","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thorin Daye","original_name":"Thorin Daye","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6520a15cc50ad200ad842388","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kafele Baruti","original_name":"Kafele Baruti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6520a163ea84c7014eff78f9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dr. Karen Baptiste","original_name":"Dr. Karen Baptiste","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6520a0f107216600ff3935ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308976,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Crabtree","original_name":"Andrew Crabtree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6520a11674507d00c57b3cdc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edwin Walker","original_name":"Edwin Walker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6520a10874507d00ac48d7ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dr. Karen Baptiste","original_name":"Dr. Karen Baptiste","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6520a12f5b124000ad6937e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard E.
