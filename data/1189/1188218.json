Film about human rights violations in Soviet Ukraine and modern Russia based on archival chronicles. Footages taken from a television film made by the Lviv TV Company in the 1960s. Those video showed the trial against the leaders of Jehovah's Witnesses. Heimrad Backer, in some of his projects, used the text of Nazi propaganda in such a way that it became self-evident, commented on itself. For the same purpose, I use excerpts from a Soviet propaganda newspaper. Religious persecution is a gross violation of Human rights. I title parts of the film - scenes in order to emphasize the absurdity, theatricality and cruelty of the trial, as well as the Soviet propaganda.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/uvX3QNZEsU3AtwWFt0nZb0qEEJo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Humans and Subhumans","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Люди і нелюди","type":"Ukrainian festival title"},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Хора и свръххора","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","original_name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65207e325b124001004e7b54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","original_name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590563de004a66d6317281e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","original_name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65905669f5f1c5783200750b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","original_name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6590565d651fcf5fcd8da1e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4308849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","original_name":"Oleksandr Stoianov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65905646e004a66cec173387","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30700904","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1586,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vPkuh7CCs77QvxP4TmuzsO9vRPW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1070},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uvX3QNZEsU3AtwWFt0nZb0qEEJo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian edition","release_date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Paris Festival for Different and Experimental cinema","release_date":"2023-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ivano-Frankivsk International Short Film Festival 4:3","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
