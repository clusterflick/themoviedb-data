She has 4 children, she's in her mid-30s, and she's the wife of a Crimean Tatar political prisoner. Muslim Crimean Tatars have been oppressed for a long time. They were deported under Stalin, allowed to return under Gorbachev, and since the occupation of Crimea in 2014 under Putin, they are being persecuted again. \"Return\" is a portrait of Mumine and Maye, two strong women struggling with the consequences of oppression. Their traditional understanding of their role as women does not stand in the way of their dedication. They possess strength, beauty and dignity. Only in their most intimate moments, they are overwhelmed by desperate helplessness.","popularity":0.2561,"poster_path":"/eFUAxw9l8Kz8PJhBQzCkAGMkoHB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Tatar","iso_639_1":"tt","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return","video":false,"vote_average":6.619,"vote_count":475,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4311262,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katja Fedulova","original_name":"Katja Fedulova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6522c9620cb33516f87ea782","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1712449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Calle Overweg","original_name":"Calle Overweg","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6522c96e0cb33516fd45a6af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2032054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Fedulova","original_name":"Katja Fedulova","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/2QvefRcIogmFmeZMuKfMuGrGrJk.jpg","credit_id":"6522c93cea84c700eb9ddfb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2032054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Fedulova","original_name":"Katja Fedulova","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/2QvefRcIogmFmeZMuKfMuGrGrJk.jpg","credit_id":"6522c94bb3f6f500ffed8589","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2032054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Fedulova","original_name":"Katja Fedulova","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/2QvefRcIogmFmeZMuKfMuGrGrJk.jpg","credit_id":"6522c9950cb33516fec380e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29352597","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q2NR7tkons5k1kRXly4rHVdoXUs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qfdqMVkwuvCKUsEirwQNSBiL8Rt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2MFqZrWuHmhpEmTGV1lkKJoASNM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/eFUAxw9l8Kz8PJhBQzCkAGMkoHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tt","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tt","note":"IDFF Artdocfest/Riga","release_date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Return | Ukraine Above All | IDFF Artdocfest/Riga 2024 | Trailer","key":"rBf4RHUKfKM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-18T11:03:12.000Z","id":"65a90a390e5aba01387debf8"}]}}}
