Like thousands of modern American nomads who can no longer afford to pay for their housing.  With no money to spare, these three sixty-year old women are fleeing, in their own way, a part of their history that has left a deep mark on them. Driving away, they try to regain some form of peace. But as the miles and seasons pass, despite their impressive temerity and resilience, their quest for a better future is challenged by unexpected events that hit a country in crisis. Will they nevertheless manage, at the end of the road, to find the serenity they are looking for, in order to become someone again?","popularity":0.6497,"poster_path":"/dE2F4mycW6q2UEndRuZVIQTUnhJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99495,"logo_path":"/sKYJk1fq5muyDP60DRcNfflusAr.png","name":"Eklektik
