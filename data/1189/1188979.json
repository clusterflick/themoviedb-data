He survived in the woods during one of the coldest winters on record, only to be captured by a Latvian battalion. Instead of killing him, they took pity on him and gave him a new name, adorned him with a uniform and a gun, and made him their child mascot, “Hitler's youngest soldier.” Building on the international bestselling book ‘The Mascot’ and an award-winning ABC documentary, the film goes above and beyond, tracing Alex’s journey to Australia with his adopted Latvian family, and his eventual life in the Melbourne suburb of Altona.","popularity":0.2289,"poster_path":"/aUecx4FS1M8MOwkBodUuK1pvHAD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jewish Nazi?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Hitler’s Jewish Soldier?","type":"TV release title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2284731,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan Goldberg","original_name":"Dan Goldberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652348720cb33516f87edc09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pvY2jn5Y3ArbPtnGvo13sSklqSQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uDo64YQvWcFSULcSDW8GpSrBi7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1896,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aUecx4FS1M8MOwkBodUuK1pvHAD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o6G3Hc1SYBLbD896QzDSaFQMRJ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sky History/Now","release_date":"2025-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Yes VOD + Hot VOD","release_date":"2024-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Doc Edge Festival 2024: The Jewish Nazi Trailer","key":"a6QFuPfN7Hw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-19T22:39:13.000Z","id":"66c936e2561d1083eef2c771"}]}}}
