It doesn't have a titlecard at the head, and the leader of the original is labeled \"Portrait\" in Stan's handwriting, so I'm not sure where the 'Wecht' title comes from. There is a 'by Brakhage' at the tail. The film is 102 feet long, and has only one splice edit, about a third of the way in. I'm not sure what interest there might be to see it, but the film will not be going into regular distribution, as Stan clearly didn't see it as a work he wanted to make widely available.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wecht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"6523535807216600e2daed37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
