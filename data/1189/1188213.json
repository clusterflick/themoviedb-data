Beneath the streets of Warsaw, under the garden of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China, are the lost writings of The Ash Kodesh (the holy fire), Rabbi Klonimus Kalmish Szapiro, a Chassidic master who was imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto. His lost aphorisms float through the hallowed trees and shadow architectures that sheltered jewish fugitives during the Shoah. In the forests, unmarked graves await commemoration; through glitch and balagan we are pulled into subterranean landscapes that emerge as fragmented archives of silence.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/fCNg9usdfAO1lOBxieeT6lFD7UA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"song of the holy fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2672555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Solomon Nagler","original_name":"Solomon Nagler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65207bf674507d01395d2dd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4322586,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zen Sun","original_name":"Zen Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c851872c13e0120cf44ae","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3660364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A.
