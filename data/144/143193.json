Behind the scenes, the film follows a Canadian naval commander, two pilots, and a volunteer rescue technician as they train for action. When an earthquake strikes Haiti, creating one of the biggest humanitarian disasters of the century, the audience is swept along, joining with the massive effort that brings military and civilian responders and hardware from around the world. Rescue is a journey of real-world disaster and emergency response captured (in 3D) with unprecedented scale and impact for the giant screen.","popularity":0.3622,"poster_path":"/398tq594ISNojcCcRrlY5GXTye2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3447,"logo_path":"/yBdvUlunhXyUowuy0XaEPuBtYTo.png","name":"IMAX","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ride with real heroes on the mission of a lifetime","title":"Rescue","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"IMAX Rescue","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"IMAX - État d'urgence 3D","type":"Version 3D"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"IMAX : État d'urgence","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"IMAX - Etat D'urgence 3D - Mission Sauvetage","type":"Version 3D"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"IMAX Rescue 3D","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"IMAX: Rescue 3D - Katastrophenhilfe auf Haiti","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Rescue 3D - Katastrophenhilfe auf Haiti (2011)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Low","original_name":"Stephen Low","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/2QKc6mOCpgAKq9zogEPKGYgQJJk.jpg","credit_id":"5357bec5c3a3685621002b18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pietro L.
