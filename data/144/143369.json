Starring Hugh Burden and Oscar winner Ray Milland, and written by Terry Nation.  Foster Twelvetrees, a struggling tragedian who scrapes a living by giving hammy performances from the classics, can hardly believe his luck when he’s invited to give a dramatic reading at the country home of a well-off family. Joy soon turns to outraged horror when he discovers dead bodies, foul intentions, lots of snakes and a madwoman in the attic. Can he uncover the hidden family secret before he comes to a sticky end..?","popularity":1.7622,"poster_path":"/p0YxNjeoIe4eglkVYxTlYhXLnhy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associated London
