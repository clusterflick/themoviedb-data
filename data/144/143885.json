Beneath the system’s environment-friendly veneer, entire ecosystems are under siege, human populations are in economic crisis, and greenhouse gases keep spewing into the atmosphere. Three years after making MYTHS FOR PROFIT, activist filmmaker Amy Miller follows up with this ambitious documentary (filmed on four continents) – a bold, highly intelligent work on the dark underbelly of green business. Even while working on a grand scale, she creates intimate portraits of numerous communities, never forgetting that global issues always affect individual lives. An essential appeal to conscience.","popularity":0.4877,"poster_path":"/rQFzS3fXHS0G0aXAVLkOAS7aS61.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Truth Behind The Carbon Market Smokescreen","title":"The Carbon Rush","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daryl Hannah","original_name":"Daryl Hannah","popularity":3.6582,"profile_path":"/4LLmp6AQdlj6ueGCRbVRSGvvFSt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4b1b9251416c750f8659","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Miller","original_name":"Amy Miller","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1b9251416c750f8655","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1930510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rQFzS3fXHS0G0aXAVLkOAS7aS61.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
