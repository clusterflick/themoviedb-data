Burroughs and noted surrealist artist Brion Gysin, this nearly 20 minute avant-garde short features repeated articulations of such random things as \"Hello,\" \"Where are we now?,\" and \"Look at that picture\" instead of music or standard dialogue. The narrative is decidedly nonlinear and perplexing, with no discernible plot whatsoever as we see images of Gysin working on his paintings and calligraphic designs and Burroughs rummaging through draws, packing a suitcase, giving a young man a physical, making a call in a phone booth, and waiting on a platform for a subway train.","popularity":0.2377,"poster_path":"/yZnMPR0JKPESNzryH0vLcrQBDGR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cut-Ups","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Cut Ups","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6471,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William S.
