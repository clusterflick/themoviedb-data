The Kiss in the Tunnel is said to mark the beginnings of narrative editing. It is in fact, two films in one, hence the 2 min length.  Firstly, the  G.A. Smith film here  for the central cheeky scene in the carriage.  The train view footage however is Cecil Hepworth's work, entitled 'View From An Engine Front - Shilla Mill Tunnel', edited into two halves in order to provide a visual narrative of the train entering the tunnel before the kiss and then leaving afterwards. More information about the filming of the phantom train ride can be found searching for the Hepworth film separately.","popularity":0.348,"poster_path":"/lwdF4ih4E88Icfdk2nKTDMdUd3K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11483,"logo_path":null,"name":"George Albert Smith Films","origin_country":""},{"id":232182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cecil Hepworth","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1899-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kiss in the Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":5.797,"vote_count":91,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Beijo no Túnel","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Tunnel Kiss","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Csók az alagútban","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Поцелуй в тоннеле","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Kiss in the Tunnel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Bayley","original_name":"Laura Bayley","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/ugz7V5OHiRjKqI1jVoCM8MYyM4f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wife (as Mrs. George Albert Smith)","credit_id":"52fe4b189251416c750f818f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Albert Smith","original_name":"George Albert Smith","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/c3Xt76gr10FFAb72u2if45LOWee.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Husband","credit_id":"52fe4b189251416c750f8193","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Albert Smith","original_name":"George Albert Smith","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/c3Xt76gr10FFAb72u2if45LOWee.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b189251416c750f8199","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Albert Smith","original_name":"George Albert Smith","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/c3Xt76gr10FFAb72u2if45LOWee.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b189251416c750f818b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125992,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cecil M.
