The late NBA great \"Pistol Pete\" Maravich appears as a member of the Army team.","popularity":0.6992,"poster_path":"/9UxYESNyLzHD8AJuwMJ0D3KLkmi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A battle of the sexes... who'll end up on top?","title":"Scoring","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dribble","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":197605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myra Taylor","original_name":"Myra Taylor","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Ernestine","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Fatone","original_name":"Charles Fatone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Alan Whittlebottom","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freya Crane","original_name":"Freya Crane","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Kathy Baker","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":197272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Perrie","original_name":"Gregg Perrie","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":"/vcfCjSad1wmo4KHkRRyAYPgVNuE.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Tony Whittlebottom","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d51","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Hardin","original_name":"Joseph Hardin","popularity":0.0815,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d55","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Maravich","original_name":"Peter Maravich","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d59","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Scotti","original_name":"Nina Scotti","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Lois Brown","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d5d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":184796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paunita Nichols","original_name":"Paunita Nichols","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/wOnMCw0hdyusRX7RML80zogBM9C.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Betty Washington","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d61","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurene Landon","original_name":"Laurene Landon","popularity":0.3494,"profile_path":"/kgSN7GBsijiQreasXAU3UkU66jw.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Marsha","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d65","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Hardiman","original_name":"Dick Hardiman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"General","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d69","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Moss","original_name":"Gary Moss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"Needham","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d6d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Jackson","original_name":"Alan Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"Ted Hemmings","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d71","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":198404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leroy Sweet","original_name":"Leroy Sweet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1013,"character":"Mayor Sam Klaus","credit_id":"52fe47fbc3a368484e0e3d75","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl B.
