Ride along with George as he shares his joys and inspirations, his fears and frustrations, his anger (or lack thereof), his hopes and dreams, his strengths and weaknesses, and his plans for the future as he gives us a unique peak into his private world. A Ride with George Hincapie is a feature-length film that provides an unprecedented look at the man behind the athlete.","popularity":0.2135,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"35 Years, 667,000 Miles, 81 Minutes","title":"A Ride With George Hincapie","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hincapie","original_name":"George Hincapie","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/5umrcrSUSsyCv2SoOaoFmwfGk2b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47f5c3a368484e0e291d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Armstrong","original_name":"Lance Armstrong","popularity":0.3273,"profile_path":"/4odeD7GO7RBpW7mNkhugXImTNhc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47f5c3a368484e0e2921","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1999077","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer: A Ride With George Hincapie","key":"Iw43-ftsk2U","published_at":"2009-04-09T21:46:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6c0c3a3685448006aea"}]}}}
