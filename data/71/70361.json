One is a Victorian-styled colony, the other a medieval kingdom. Both leave Rampart in a state of constant wonder, as he finds his way among humans and aliens, strange dreams and even stranger reality, a dark keep and a red sea, and more universal matters of war and peace, good and bad, love and hate and sickness and health.","popularity":2.2864,"poster_path":"/vMvt7HJKL9vBLzq6yHcwjJQQBFe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70,"logo_path":"/ueaENQkPcy8rlr5fGZVBXKOhlBh.png","name":"American
