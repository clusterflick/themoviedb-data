With unprecedented access, Emily James spent over a year embedded in activist groups such as Climate Camp and Plane Stupid, documenting their clandestine activities. Torpedoing the tired cliches of the environmental movement, Just Do It introduces you to a powerful cast of mischievous and inspiring characters who put their bodies in the way. They super-glue themselves to bank trading floors, blockade factories and attack coal power stations en-masse all despite the very real threat of arrest. Their adventures will entertain, illuminate and inspire.","popularity":0.0913,"poster_path":"/9lSxiYwT3FoX9C8diHp3ga9GTTU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just Do It - a tale of modern-day outlaws.","title":"Just Do It: A Tale of Modern-day Outlaws","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589167,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Ledbitter","original_name":"James Ledbitter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4806c3a368484e0e5c83","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Simpson","original_name":"Laura Simpson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4806c3a368484e0e5c7d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":205942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily James","original_name":"Emily James","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4806c3a368484e0e5c77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1941569","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9lSxiYwT3FoX9C8diHp3ga9GTTU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1653}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Just Do It - [Theatrical Trailer HD]- a tale of modern-day outlaws","key":"zavTd31qxho","published_at":"2011-06-28T14:20:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6c0c3a3685448006b2a"}]}}}
