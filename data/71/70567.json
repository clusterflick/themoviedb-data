With his latest film, Block turns in the other direction, offering an exceptionally moving film about his relationship with his only child, Lucy. THE KIDS GROW UP is a chronicle of Lucy's emotionally-fraught last year at home before leaving for college. Moving fluidly between past, present and the fast-approaching future, Block uses a lifetime of footage to craft not only a loving portrait of a girl transitioning into womanhood, but also an incredibly candid look at modern-day parenting, marriage, and what it means to let go.","popularity":0.1413,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Letting go is hard to do","title":"The Kids Grow Up","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Block","original_name":"Doug Block","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8a5fac3a3682ed700062a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1321332","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Kids Grow Up - Trailer","key":"u4MvDW7ox6s","published_at":"2011-04-22T20:24:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"58a006b092514125fd00243b"}]}}}
