Jesus teaches that forgiveness comes from God as He instructs Peter to catch a fish that contains a coin to pay Peter's debt. Jesus also teaches about a man who is forgiven by his king of an enormous debt. Yet, the forgiven man leaves and immediately casts a man, who owes him almost nothing, into prison. The king then rescinds his forgiveness. To receive forgiveness we must also forgive.","popularity":0.4636,"poster_path":"/yBm9kKXwuIIaSTMs9aMjQyFpaJG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4107,"logo_path":"/nV1eu9bqF38PufXbth8BrVltXWR.png","name":"NEST Family Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":140873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animated Bible Stories","origin_country":""},{"id":4108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rich Animation Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgive Us Our Debts","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Animated Stories from the New Testament: Forgive Us Our Debts","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Animated Stories from the New Testament 14 - Forgive Us Our Debts","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2132661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John A.
