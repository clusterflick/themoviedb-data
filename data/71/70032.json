George Daugherty brings this timeless tale to modern audiences by seamlessly weaving live-action with animation and music by the RCA Symphony Orchestra. The story opens as a grandfather (Lloyd Bridges) hosts his daughter (Kirstie Alley) and grandson (Ross Malinger from Sleepless in Seattle) during a visit to his country cottage. After lunch, the trio settles in as grandfather recounts \"The Story\" of Peter's adventures with a bird, cat, and dizzy duck on the outskirts \"of a very dark forest.\" The film morphs into a clever cartoon designed by the legendary Chuck Jones (of Wile E. Coyote fame). The \"story within a story\" leaps to life while the accompanying musical instruments also emerge as playful personalities.","popularity":0.7728,"poster_path":"/ao8U9teLB9FWumCzzvFshfHP6Ej.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174679,"logo_path":null,"name":"IF/X Production","origin_country":"US"},{"id":96085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chuck Jones Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":8180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosgrove Hall Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter and the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chuck Jones' Peter and the Wolf","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirstie Alley","original_name":"Kirstie Alley","popularity":1.4647,"profile_path":"/9XZOeQtmvHdBkuMrlxO5PHPZwJo.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Annie / Narrator (voice) / Duck (voice) / Cat (voice)","credit_id":"5eaf19f7edeb430023c7d1af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Malinger","original_name":"Ross Malinger","popularity":1.5075,"profile_path":"/7GiouqIfxSH14Xy8KToensUDVGK.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"52fe47e7c3a368484e0dfa8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Bridges","original_name":"Lloyd Bridges","popularity":1.0226,"profile_path":"/3dUJhLyaOl32mOU9HBpgTniLNJc.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Grandfather","credit_id":"5eaf1a3223be46001d215cb1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Ka Lik Wong","original_name":"David Ka Lik Wong","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d008871685da009f4f2cba","department":"Production","job":"Unit Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491615,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kelly Tartan","original_name":"Kelly Tartan","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d009890d2f5301d9a5d140","department":"Editing","job":"First Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Suranie","original_name":"Elaine Suranie","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d009188dbc33009d7a852b","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Jones","original_name":"Chuck Jones","popularity":0.4093,"profile_path":"/6LaYJXpfX6hry3mT8QTEGCPIUdi.jpg","credit_id":"63d0085a1685da008361fd8d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Rockstroh","original_name":"Linda Rockstroh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d009031685da00c9236c04","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575681,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Divisek","original_name":"Barbara Divisek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d009331b157d00d5499113","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Daugherty","original_name":"George Daugherty","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/isSKqoXmvAh596WgUW8kZLNCxU1.jpg","credit_id":"63d009a1b6cff10084a85be0","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59838,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Scott Meehan","original_name":"Scott Meehan","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d00963b6cff100e91fe4d0","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888989,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jennifer Gilroy","original_name":"Jennifer Gilroy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d00eae1b157d008a34488d","department":"Camera","job":"Second Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888965,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Melinda Lawton","original_name":"Melinda Lawton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d0094db6cff100b9364a7f","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3116078,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carol A.
