In order to pay the troops Wellesley needs a money draft from the banker Rothschild, but fears he has been captured by the French and sends Sharpe behind enemy lines to find him. Sharpe is given command of a platoon of crack riflemen, led by the surly Irishman Harper and including Hagman and Harris, who resent Sharpe as not being a 'proper officer'.","popularity":1.3884,"poster_path":"/6SlQG6yOPvgettZ8KsbT2zEWh4c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7783,"logo_path":"/gXDRmyPivfsS5jVAoDdrbhpdyk7.png","name":"Celtic Films
