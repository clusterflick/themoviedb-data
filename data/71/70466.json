The style is somewhat similar to that of the classic Hard Grit, in that it provides a historical perspective to the climbing of the area. In this case Bohusln on the Swedish west coast. We also get to meet and listen to some of the climbers who, through the decades, have been important to the development, of difficulty as well as ethics, and hear their thoughts on climbing and risk. As would be expected, these thoughts range from profound to cliche. Of course, there's also a lot of climbing, from moderates to FA's of cutting edge \"death\" routes.","popularity":0.4482,"poster_path":"/tRQX756SFTvgFSK9dYlmaI0VVfO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plonk Entertainment Production","origin_country":""},{"id":42006,"logo_path":null,"name":"High&Low","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story about passion","title":"Crackoholic","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Houlding","original_name":"Leo Houlding","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/fCGaODxX211epwzStQqwQrlLJOV.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55241f129251416d6a004a66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1971889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saïd Belhaj","original_name":"Saïd Belhaj","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zH5Vlr1qvQp765V0Lojsq3Cnzef.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63a4e954fc5f06007cd2f5f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Wulf","original_name":"Stefan Wulf","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55241f329251415c7c00987d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Klarström","original_name":"Andreas Klarström","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55241fcac3a3684dda009d30","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Liliemark","original_name":"Jan Liliemark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55242024c3a368333a00726a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Granqvist","original_name":"Lars Granqvist","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55242031c3a36828d1006d7a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Christian Doseth","original_name":"Hans Christian Doseth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5524203cc3a3684dda009d4c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rikard Ekehed","original_name":"Rikard Ekehed","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55242051c3a36828d1006d8a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Paulsson","original_name":"Jonas Paulsson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55241f7dc3a3684dc1009190","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikael Widerberg","original_name":"Mikael Widerberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55241f84c3a3684dc1009195","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUZDtIpz9DPKrd5x5wUobfq4EPn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1426,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tRQX756SFTvgFSK9dYlmaI0VVfO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1192,"name":"sweden"},{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":201008,"name":"rock climbing"},{"id":209437,"name":"trad climbing"},{"id":209438,"name":"bohuslän"},{"id":209439,"name":"sport climbing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
