A small village in the Jura is split by the river Loue which creates the line of demarcation between Nazi occupied France and freedom. A French officer, Pierre, is released by the Nazi soldiers to find his chateau converted into a German command centre. Whilst he is obliged to co-operate with the enemy, his wife Mary supports the resistance movement and is willing to risk her life for it. The Nazis step up their activity against the resistance, insisting that any who attempt to cross the line of demarcation will be shot. When his wife is arrested, Pierre decides to switch his allegiance.","popularity":0.963,"poster_path":"/qUX9CorgUHlVgDUvtEbkXgmIMSc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1966-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Line of Demarcation","video":false,"vote_average":6.152,"vote_count":33,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"분계선","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Seberg","original_name":"Jean Seberg","popularity":1.1357,"profile_path":"/mNW6MJ5YAiFWAnH9pCmi0PjKXc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary de Damville","credit_id":"52fe47f2c3a368484e0e1e45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Ronet","original_name":"Maurice Ronet","popularity":0.3143,"profile_path":"/kNoCaKscnlHGTUucSUwjla7QT1v.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pierre, comte de Damville","credit_id":"52fe47f2c3a368484e0e1e49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gélin","original_name":"Daniel Gélin","popularity":0.293,"profile_path":"/i5zZUU4IhqmJ8EZtbBy2hDRrAyl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Doctor Jacques Lafaye","credit_id":"52fe47f2c3a368484e0e1e4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinhard Kolldehoff","original_name":"Reinhard Kolldehoff","popularity":0.4629,"profile_path":"/VogLnWJGDw6Ukiv5ofTSgcuetg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"le Major von Pritsch","credit_id":"52fe47f2c3a368484e0e1e51","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario David","original_name":"Mario David","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/uzDU2ihass7cnBxiKw1aJO96pdn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Urbain","credit_id":"52fe47f2c3a368484e0e1e55","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Yanne","original_name":"Jean Yanne","popularity":0.2846,"profile_path":"/nZAsOM0mtE0oHHj9DlbH94SxtAI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"M.
