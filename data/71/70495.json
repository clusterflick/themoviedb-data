The film traces Pasolini's life chronologically - family roots, hiding during World War II, teaching, moving to Rome, being arrested and acquitted many times, publishing poems, getting into film, being provocative, and being murdered. Interviews with Alberto Moravia, Laura Betti, Maria Antonietta Macciocch, and Bernard Bertolucci are inter-cut with readings of Pasolini's poems and with clips from four films - primarily the Gospel According to St. Matthew - to illustrate his changing ideas and points of view. Bregstein makes a case for Pasolini's being lynched.","popularity":0.2608,"poster_path":"/ldgHTDuR2IAyzf2pIw1XxcWaAxw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29459,"logo_path":"/el8phAL6Xa6vXvvaQNiELmEOgx8.png","name":"VARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1981-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about Pier Paolo Pasolini","title":"Whoever Says the Truth Shall Die","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini","original_name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini","popularity":0.6207,"profile_path":"/AdUQ0eBR9xWKh7f7KAN7yiHamAr.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Self- archive footage","credit_id":"67de9af3c28404e629f57f81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3780,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alberto Moravia","original_name":"Alberto Moravia","popularity":0.3306,"profile_path":"/fcve5GrHVl1FQjck2CRFw65E348.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self -
