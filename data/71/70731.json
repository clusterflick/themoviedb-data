They are also alcoholics. In her documentary, Carolin Schmitz explores the protagonists’ stories and their strategies for survival: the little tricks they employ in order to try and get through their daily lives – lives which become increasingly difficult to manage the stronger the addiction becomes. Their fear of losing control and being exposed as a drinker create their need to conform, but the protagonists can only cope with this pressure by increasing their alcohol intake.","popularity":0.0994,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63582,"logo_path":null,"name":"58Filme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portraits deutscher Alkoholiker","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolin Schmitz","original_name":"Carolin Schmitz","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe480dc3a368484e0e712f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolin Schmitz","original_name":"Carolin Schmitz","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f70516c3a368417d0086ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Oliveira Pita","original_name":"Stefan Oliveira Pita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f70532c3a368419000866e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72807,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Olaf Hirschberg","original_name":"Olaf Hirschberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f70525c3a368413b008ce1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1588339","wikidata_id":"Q80349496","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
