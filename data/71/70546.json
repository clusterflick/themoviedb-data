With different levels of experience, each volunteer must find their own way to face the challenges, the tough choices, and the limits of their idealism. \"Living in Emergency\" is a window into the seldom portrayed and less-than glamorous side of humanitarian aid work. It explores a world that is challenging, complex, and fraught with dilemmas - the struggles, both internal and external, that aid workers face when working in war zones and other difficult contexts.","popularity":0.1327,"poster_path":"/3Wbnw3ppyyemQALpoK7TGdUgZWf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107502,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Floor Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":107503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doctors Without Borders","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Higher Stakes.
