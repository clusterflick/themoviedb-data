When the Outsider escapes into the jungles of South America, the government sends in some ex-military convicts to catch the beast. But what starts out as a high-speed chase ends up in bloody carnage. Only Einstein knows the Outsider's motives, and only the canine can outsmart the creature. Now, it's a battle of beasts as man's best friend confronts man's worst nightmare.","popularity":1.5426,"poster_path":"/hvTELe32dAquzKECcISG77wha5c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iguana Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":4527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concorde Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"1994-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The beast is loose.
