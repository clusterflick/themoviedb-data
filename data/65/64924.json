The film, bursting with rare stock footage never before seen by Western audiences, is a creative first-hand look at why the West intervened in the Yugoslav conflict, with an impressive roster of interviews with academics, diplomats, media personalities and ordinary citizens of the former Yugoslav republics. This film also presents positive stories from the Yugoslav wars - people helping each other regardless of their ethnic background, stories of bravery and self-sacrifice.","popularity":2.8713,"poster_path":"/4QvHRS1P38JkOTH2pwuQGlF54ul.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malagurski Cinema","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2010-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weight of Chains","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El peso de las cadenas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rade Aleksic","original_name":"Rade Aleksic","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe46f1c3a368484e0ac6e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Bissett","original_name":"James Bissett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe46f1c3a368484e0ac6e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Chossudovsky","original_name":"Michel Chossudovsky","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe46f1c3a368484e0ac6e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Parenti","original_name":"Michael Parenti","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/10VJ0mSCftaO9NGVhrOneLra9j9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621d1e536b5fc20042dddbfd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Malagurski","original_name":"Boris Malagurski","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/lJbfvAC7uX4uglrORv8ZikqQnUv.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46f1c3a368484e0ac6dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Malagurski","original_name":"Boris Malagurski","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/lJbfvAC7uX4uglrORv8ZikqQnUv.jpg","credit_id":"5a10c207c3a36862890399af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1789083","wikidata_id":"Q1168449","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nF3b4QGe4OsAFJHlEYwZf25IAbz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1DLABi3d8chPdqtKvSNhRYpe6OX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4QvHRS1P38JkOTH2pwuQGlF54ul.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e2cgX9TbzDrLpFV1eqL0Q0zRsKU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":765,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ai5cRzhCLQvOvcD5DQyAlL7BZr9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":797,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eqMAvPkCGnkjzRiNBspvDjuVYjW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":449,"name":"yugoslavia"},{"id":7202,"name":"balkan war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Weight of Chains | NEW TRAILER","key":"6Qi50Mun4RA","published_at":"2010-09-22T21:54:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6bbc3a368544800672b"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Weight Of Chains | Trailer","key":"L60-vPnbXOg","published_at":"2009-10-06T04:59:44.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6bbc3a368544800672a"}]}}}
