This is the story of the rock n roll dream and its accompanying nightmares. Millions of sales on both sides of the Atlantic, near bankruptcy, pills, thrills, spats, prats, success, excess, pick me ups, breakdowns and of course some of THE defining music of the late 20th Century. This is the definitive and fully authorised story of the UK's most inspired and dissolute label, from the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain at the Living Room to Oasis at Knebworth.","popularity":0.9453,"poster_path":"/jV4USc1ivMeaaD0vMrfVfWiWmWb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of ’The most Rock ‘n’ Roll label ever’","title":"Upside Down: The Creation Records Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.115,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Upside Down The Creation Records Story","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan McGee","original_name":"Alan McGee","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5873b388c3a368177000d769","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Gillespie","original_name":"Bobby Gillespie","popularity":0.0746,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Primal Scream","credit_id":"5873b3a09251410e6800c718","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Gallagher","original_name":"Noel Gallagher","popularity":0.4549,"profile_path":"/aBFYsStheYLMxlmyugFBgEEa7dA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Oasis","credit_id":"5873b3aec3a368177000d77c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny O'Connor","original_name":"Danny O'Connor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5873b36ec3a368174100c376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1764726","wikidata_id":"Q7899268","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uMcJraVZ3ojHV6C6w1KsfNt41CX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p8rbsDiDddBufzSVzntmtvYxjug.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jV4USc1ivMeaaD0vMrfVfWiWmWb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w5wr276CRsGemNxPqPvnOFsQ1Bu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":260241,"name":"shoegaze"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'Upside Down' - The Creation Records Story","key":"quC36o_9ZLo","published_at":"2010-01-20T09:11:39.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53ac9224c3a3682ee6000440"}]}}}
