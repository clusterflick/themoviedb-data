We were determined to dispel this myth and show the true nature of wolves. Compassionate family animals, both playful and affectionate. For six years in a tented camp in the wilderness of Idaho, we lived among a pack of wolves, listening to them, earning their trust.Now in \"Living With Wolves,\" we share more of the story of The Sawtooth Pack, first told in our two-time Emmy Award-winning documentary, Wolves at Our Door. Our own lives, brought together by a devotion to wildlife, were forever changed by these elusive, intelligent animals who accepted us. Overcoming forest fires, marauding mountain lions and sub-zero winters, we share with you a heart-warming and unique partnership of human and predator, built on trust and defying the storm of controversy surrounding the wolf.","popularity":0.5442,"poster_path":"/eA7R8WDYmV3EUfptMzzLQDsiZdb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living with Wolves","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Discovery: Living with Wolves","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liev Schreiber","original_name":"Liev Schreiber","popularity":2.5942,"profile_path":"/gTHvDnTN52iTdnQPVPu6LhirUHc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"52fe46d6c3a368484e0a68dd","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0473506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmua0RajGrYqCjL9ahizMXaSfOg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eA7R8WDYmV3EUfptMzzLQDsiZdb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1994,"name":"wolf"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":162342,"name":"discovery"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
