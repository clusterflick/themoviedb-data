The viewer will be led through the broad spectrum of exceptional building culture in Lower Austria, a culture which provides art, theater and music with the plentiful and spectacular stages it deserves.","popularity":0.2612,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7180,"logo_path":null,"name":"RIHA Filmproduktions
