A disheartened IT professor called Tariq Siddhiqi, (Anupam kher) who is basically disappointed with the orthodox education system and Devang Tripathi (Ashish Vidyarthi) an alcoholic professor who is thrown out from Mumbai University for his abstract methodology for teaching and Arjun Sheghal, (Ankur Khanna) an under achieving student who disenchants the traditional education system as he doesn't believe in grading system and Priyanka (Arshi) who wants to break through the typical parental pressure of our society to accomplish her passion as a super model. Finally as they all possess the same perception towards our stereotypical education system, they decide to go against to it and they form an abstract pattern of education system to encourage the failed students of our society.","popularity":0.3453,"poster_path":"/xNXFmTO8gU3vcxdzlz12c12UhS0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Admissions Open","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anupam Kher","original_name":"Anupam Kher","popularity":0.8891,"profile_path":"/f7hWJ4tvzR7uXmYoTiB41TpQ2NZ.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Professor Tariq Siddiqui","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashish Vidhyarthi","original_name":"Ashish Vidhyarthi","popularity":0.5398,"profile_path":"/iBUUpfHZIfpC5afHrHwcyGTHKQF.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Devang","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa07","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arshi","original_name":"Arshi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Priyanka","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa0b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ankur Khanna","original_name":"Ankur Khanna","popularity":0.1694,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Arjun Sehgal","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa0f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pramod Muthu","original_name":"Pramod Muthu","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Dean Raghvendra","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa13","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ravi Pandey","original_name":"Ravi Pandey","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/dY5F5DYFf8IcBuCMPv7imvYMGho.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Sharad","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa17","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rati Agnihotri","original_name":"Rati Agnihotri","popularity":0.2088,"profile_path":"/a4E2eoMZAt8bxRwSzX208UXBza5.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Radhika","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa1b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sudesh Berry","original_name":"Sudesh Berry","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/h9OTRNIcHMtmdtwWeX4KuKLWjKl.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa1f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shishir Sharma","original_name":"Shishir Sharma","popularity":0.2246,"profile_path":"/fNyJckJRkWhMassWL6YlkPMFfvK.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Mr. Sehgal","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa23","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85398,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Raju Khan","original_name":"Raju Khan","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa2f","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223854,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amit Trivedi","original_name":"Amit Trivedi","popularity":0.2001,"profile_path":"/lRewkQ2Smolc0TjNMSycYHnbFil.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46e9c3a368484e0aaa29","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K.
