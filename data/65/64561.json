Romy has chosen former circus performers, mimes, and actors from street theater -- most of them in their first-time film roles -- to interpret these diverse and off-the-wall couples/couplings. One young mute woman finds her voice through a ventriloquist, another falls in love with a trapeze artist, and a village idiot finds a unique way to experience his first intimate sexual encounter.","popularity":0.1095,"poster_path":"/iGslr8Hc4saR5UEJvkrSVfowLxQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le bar des amants","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Romy","original_name":"Bruno Romy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/qm8IHXOKH2GrFj8iBuJXIqHqA6Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Edmond","credit_id":"52fe46dfc3a368484e0a8669","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascaline Herveet","original_name":"Pascaline Herveet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mia","credit_id":"52fe46dfc3a368484e0a866d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuelle Wion","original_name":"Emmanuelle Wion","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/2e6qznFvVq7B6wx3AuZ5e710OMx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"52fe46dfc3a368484e0a8671","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Luley","original_name":"Jacques Luley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Le patron du bar","credit_id":"52fe46dfc3a368484e0a8675","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Romy","original_name":"Bruno Romy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/qm8IHXOKH2GrFj8iBuJXIqHqA6Z.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46dfc3a368484e0a8665","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0139880","wikidata_id":"Q65154503","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iGslr8Hc4saR5UEJvkrSVfowLxQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
