It culminated in an album released worldwide on October 11, 2005, entitled The All-Star Sessions. Four \"team captains\" were chosen to lead 57 artists from 45 past and present Roadrunner bands, and produce and oversee the album's 18 tracks: Joey Jordison of Slipknot and Murderdolls; Matt Heafy of Trivium; Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Asesino and Divine Heresy and formerly of Brujeria; and Robert Flynn of Machine Head and formerly of Vio-lence and Forbidden. The unprecedented project was the brainchild of Roadrunner UK General Manager Mark Palmer and Roadrunner USA VP of A&amp;R Monte Conner.","popularity":0.338,"poster_path":"/xPdjojibj1KA3b4flcKpG8XUDg2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadrunner Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Metal concert to end all metal concert","title":"Roadrunner United: The Concert","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino Cazares","original_name":"Dino Cazares","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Duce","original_name":"Adam Duce","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f2d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gray","original_name":"Paul Gray","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/847hi9rwVVXPE0zPBTP6usOoMr9.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f31","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Jordison","original_name":"Joey Jordison","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/kNJw5kIOar5lHM17xvWNcNjFgh2.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f35","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Kisser","original_name":"Andreas Kisser","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/929sV9SkWtonxfktv0MsNYEskY3.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f39","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robb Flynn","original_name":"Robb Flynn","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/sludtOpMSU8I9topvNyl4lUvHyI.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f61","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238733,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joel Fendelman","original_name":"Joel Fendelman","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f3f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238734,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Greenhouse","original_name":"Paul Greenhouse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f45","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238735,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manny Gutierrez","original_name":"Manny Gutierrez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f4b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ned Doyle","original_name":"Ned Doyle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f51","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238738,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kooster McAlister","original_name":"Kooster McAlister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f57","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Lamoureux","original_name":"Pierre Lamoureux","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46cac3a368484e0a3f5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1566388","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPdjojibj1KA3b4flcKpG8XUDg2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
