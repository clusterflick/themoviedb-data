Occasionally, the director comments about the characters or their motivations, and sometimes the actor does. That's all -- there is no action, there are no location shots, no one pretends to be anything else. The script itself tells about an encounter between a blank-slate of a woman hitchhiker, and a communist truck driver. As the reading progresses, Duras comments bitterly about the failed ideals of communism and the glorious revolution that will probably never happen.","popularity":0.3862,"poster_path":"/93knueN8tjQ3jAe8NrYFbivGi2I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Auditel","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":55321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéma
