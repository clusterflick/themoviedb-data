In conversations with his family and friends and his own reflections, he paints an ever clearer, if contradictory picture of what happened and of the consequences for each of the family members. Old family films seem to show a happy family - excerpts from Michael's first feature film hint at his extreme adult life, overshadowed by his lifelong trauma. Yet in spite of the intense drama, the film doesn't have an atmosphere of anger and hatred but rather a surprising air of hope and love of life. Michael's aim is not to accuse the \"perpetrator\" but to understand. In the end, he takes his video \"Postcard\" to his father. With the camera running, he confronts him with his past.","popularity":0.2861,"poster_path":"/rD1F0ug25qHBCZDZhNoDu9Ijb6R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Stock Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcard to Daddy","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Stock","original_name":"Michael Stock","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fdb7d733f7e1d003e436337","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Stock","original_name":"Michael Stock","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535ab29f0e0a264feb00037a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1595858","wikidata_id":"Q27664021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j50Vy4toXT7dy7o25pXF3vH7e21.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rD1F0ug25qHBCZDZhNoDu9Ijb6R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1251}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2337,"name":"pedophilia"},{"id":516,"name":"child abuse"},{"id":740,"name":"aids"},{"id":33841,"name":"incest"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Postcard To Daddy - Trailer english subtitled","key":"uR9XA0-gpcQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-10T20:45:50.000Z","id":"5ff8f4301c0435003dba7f95"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Postcard To Daddy by Michael Stock - Trailer (english subtitled)","key":"pYqTjzgvtjY","published_at":"2010-04-13T14:52:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"535abb190e0a264fd8000490"}]}}}
