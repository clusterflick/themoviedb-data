The series explore the life and death of Jesus, and the men and women whose belief, conviction, and martyrdom created the religion we now know as Christianity. Drawing upon historical evidence, the series challenges familiar assumptions and conventional notions about Christian origins. Archaeological finds have yielded new understandings of Jesus' class and social status; fresh interpretations have transformed earlier ideas about the identity of the early Christians and their communities. Interviews with twelve scholars New Testament theologians, archaeologists, and historians. The scholars together represent a range of viewpoints and diversity of faiths and a shared commitment to bring new ways of thinking about Christianity to a public audience. They discuss the value in a historical approach to Jesus and the Bible and whether Christian faith can be reconciled with such an approach.","popularity":0.1528,"poster_path":"/eU3ZN20GKiKJnE15WmSbGH2UcTy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239738,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Cran","original_name":"William Cran","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63be1e7dfc31d30081ae7837","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2680429,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marilyn H.
