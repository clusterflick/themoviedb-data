All \"teenage savages\" at the time when communism disappeared in Eastern Europe, they now view the world in a sinister way. Examples: A woman becomes irritated with a man who has left his dog. A father has an argument with his wife about an alarming (to the parents) arousal of sexuality in their 10 y.o. daughter. A young girl is distressed by her growing realization that she is more and more like her sadistic grandmother. A conversation between two guys, apparently about an old car, takes an unexpected turn.","popularity":0.142,"poster_path":"/lXXBbvUsD9yKuUOgg1E6t001KKs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11007,"logo_path":"/irlUVryOnJuz7iD5K7cy1bdQH4e.png","name":"Inforg
