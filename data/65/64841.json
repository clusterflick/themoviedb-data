The concert footage is from Stone's sold-out show at New York City's Irving Plaza, a venue known for its intimacy and for hosting the best alternative and cutting-edge acts on the contemporary music scene. The youthful Stone is known for her unique renditions of soul and R&B classics, but has also emerged as a skillful songwriter. She has collaborated on songs with other artists as diverse as Betty Wright, Portishead's Beth Gibbons, and the Roots. The MIND, BODY & SOUL SESSIONS contains performances by Stone of hits from both of her multi-platinum albums, including her singles \"You Had Me,\" \"Super Duper Love,\" and \"Fell in Love With a Boy,\" a re-working of a song by fellow hipsters the White Stripes. The MIND, BODY & SOUL SESSIONS allows fans to get close to Stone at her best, in a soulful live performance in a special setting.","popularity":0.4548,"poster_path":"/2XcIxYMo0kGOUuKMvQeQ7SQn5Tm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203243,"logo_path":null,"name":"S-Curve Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live in New York City","title":"Joss Stone - Mind, Body & Soul Sessions","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joss Stone","original_name":"Joss Stone","popularity":0.7747,"profile_path":"/kFbmkxR4RjvEhKQ4Ad7LFVoevR4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab875","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Angry","original_name":"Ray Angry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7n6WFEuf1moiWE8dv7bbguVBbaq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"SL Keys & Vox","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab879","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gilmore","original_name":"David Gilmore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rxO1vmNgnzZu7IybnSDKW8gwOcu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab87d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caesar Griffin","original_name":"Caesar Griffin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab881","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Iannacone","original_name":"Peter Iannacone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vtRgHlYO4vQJEAlniNdXnNUJoes.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab885","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abel Pabon","original_name":"Abel Pabon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"SR Keys","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab889","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellison Kendrick","original_name":"Ellison Kendrick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Backing Vocals","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab88d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artia Lockett","original_name":"Artia Lockett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Backing Vocals","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab891","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonia Williams","original_name":"Antonia Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Backing Vocals","credit_id":"52fe46edc3a368484e0ab895","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2086737,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rod Wardell","original_name":"Rod Wardell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649ef0e98289a0011cc205d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2348274,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heidi Kelso","original_name":"Heidi Kelso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649ef087c9dbf900acbaf284","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0472535","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2RO1ejPnvXhCSqonwrupUkHFpor.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1441,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2XcIxYMo0kGOUuKMvQeQ7SQn5Tm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1005}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
