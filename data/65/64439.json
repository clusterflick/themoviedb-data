The stories illustrate the absolute claim of a woman who can understand love only in terms of life and death, an attitude that generally makes love appear dramatic, but at least burning and flickering, like the flame that glows in her heart.","popularity":0.1929,"poster_path":"/zrfT3mgvnDDCoOpHf2745NMTw20.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Garance
