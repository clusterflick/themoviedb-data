In aircraft construction, a flush rivet reduces drag, thus increasing aircraft performance. This World War II-era Walt Disney industrial-training film teaches four methods of flush-riveting aircraft aluminum sheet metal: the Countersink method, the Double Dimple method, the Pre-Dimple method, and the Combination Pre-Dimple and Countersink method. The choice of method to use is based upon the thicknesses of the top and bottom metal sheets.","popularity":0.2396,"poster_path":"/xDns2pMEMyjm17aeSeyFrvtLrfl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Methods of Flush Riveting","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Algar","original_name":"James Algar","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/awqwWqAZ4b6rBhivYfLDbnsxLQe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46e2c3a368484e0a93bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1202008","wikidata_id":"Q3079986","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1069,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nxhotIX5IbNZWyAWWMroMk4FccO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1900}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ccfRXx9alJz4hmgbNmKwEpihV4t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xDns2pMEMyjm17aeSeyFrvtLrfl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208328,"name":"training film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Delivered to NFBC","release_date":"1942-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
