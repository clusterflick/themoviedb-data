It aired on CBS-TV from 1969â€“1971 before a 20-year run in local syndication. The show was inspired by Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In,[1] the major difference being that Hee Haw was far less topical, and was centered on country music. Initially co-hosted by musicians Buck Owens and Roy Clark, the show was equally well-known for its voluptuous, scantily-clad women in stereotypical farmer's daughter outfits, male stars Jim and Jon Hager and its cornpone humor.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/s0ElzsGdIy1kUm3Kd5p4weqG2sJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hee Haw","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0063908","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s0ElzsGdIy1kUm3Kd5p4weqG2sJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
