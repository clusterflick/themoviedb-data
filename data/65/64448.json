A series of small events disrupts their delicately balanced ecosystem. Jessika's father loses his job and becomes bored and despondent, while Jessika's mother reenters the workforce and becomes empowered. These events act as catalysts for the slow, painful disintegration of the family, with each member committing shocking acts of alienation and self-destruction. Desperately wanting her family but at the same time desiring her adolescent independence, Jessika struggles to find the best way to restore a balance.","popularity":0.4409,"poster_path":"/bD42ZjZl6RS536XdCmdoj0RVxw4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13536,"logo_path":null,"name":"mem-film","origin_country":""},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Losing Balance","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Draußen am See","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Schlott","original_name":"Elisa Schlott","popularity":0.1623,"profile_path":"/qHtGUjBRtjOKmlMuNfWRQSkzPj2.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Jessika Borowski","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Kleinert","original_name":"Petra Kleinert","popularity":0.1838,"profile_path":"/tPqGIETrV3FzUzeuRvWgZoR5SO8.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Tine Borowski","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lott","original_name":"Michael Lott","popularity":0.5642,"profile_path":"/mrcpCpFKImS2eqpVV5TAAxRnM6P.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Ernst Borowski","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sina Tkotsch","original_name":"Sina Tkotsch","popularity":0.2644,"profile_path":"/zSKAW6sO128omciWbzBQrjCuMj7.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Caro Borowski","credit_id":"5346a1760e0a265fec001770","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annekathrin Bürger","original_name":"Annekathrin Bürger","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/tcRJqBpyUCWkzBQCrlH9Q2YGHxQ.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Oma Annemarie","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77df","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":439032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Trinks","original_name":"Benjamin Trinks","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/rv7wLFEleg3JecnA76gu9XeofAH.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Basti","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77e3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":299506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Befort","original_name":"Max Befort","popularity":0.2441,"profile_path":"/2gyBHAaeo6RVbpw27I93GURk6QL.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77e7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":576586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Rollar","original_name":"Christine Rollar","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/kJLYwbtlsRViBPdYdwMhu523EgP.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Erzieherin","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":445372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederic Welter","original_name":"Frederic Welter","popularity":0.3679,"profile_path":"/fxAKzkI1DxDnJYu3rlc0QKi3AgC.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Jens","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77ef","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Fuchssteiner","original_name":"Felix Fuchssteiner","popularity":0.1172,"profile_path":"/i5dca9R31qwBjWo1mSujCWjFbJM.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46dbc3a368484e0a77cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Fuchssteiner","original_name":"Felix Fuchssteiner","popularity":0.1172,"profile_path":"/i5dca9R31qwBjWo1mSujCWjFbJM.jpg","credit_id":"553d63d4c3a3683e55006551","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1459484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katharina Schöde","original_name":"Katharina Schöde","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553d63e79251415852001667","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1459484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katharina Schöde","original_name":"Katharina Schöde","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553d6403c3a368784500d262","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63834,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philipp F.
