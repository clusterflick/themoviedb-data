Its inhabitants have mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind a tableau mourant of reinforced concrete, metal and plastic debris coexisting with glorious marble and the local flora and fauna. Part science fiction, part archaeological mystery, the work offers a picturesque expedition of the new Greek ruins, through an apposition of findings that serve as hints for the unknown fate of the filmâ€™s elusive protagonists: the -conspicuous by absence- Athenians.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As to Posterity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Gioti","original_name":"Marina Gioti","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fb45f04955b4a206f16003","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
