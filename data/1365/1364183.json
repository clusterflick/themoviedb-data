Working closely with drummer Brann Dailor, HBJ re-imagined the narrative from the legendary concept album as an animated film that takes viewers on a journey across the cosmos with a telepathic, paraplegic boy as he astral projects across time, space and the spirit world. Working from the original concept album artwork by Paul Romano, HBJ and its team of illustrators and animators developed an animated sci-fi film that features fantastic worlds for every song of the album. Illustrator Skinner collaborated once again with HBJ providing a series of mind altering concept designs of Rasputin, Satan and a slew of creatures and demons that populated the “Crack the Skye” film. Creative Directors Gina Niespodziani and Mark Szumski led the team but also handled all editing, cgi and composting.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mastodon - Crack The Skye 10th Anniversary Tour Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mastodon - Crack the Skye: 10th Anniversary  Animations","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mastodon","original_name":"Mastodon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66faf4683a0f5a08c8f1a3d8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556894,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mark Szumski","original_name":"Mark Szumski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf4901c5df25f10d0210f","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556894,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mark Szumski","original_name":"Mark Szumski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf4a3703e24dc7c134abb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556894,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mark Szumski","original_name":"Mark Szumski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf4ad703e24dc7c134acf","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2700364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gina Niespodziani","original_name":"Gina Niespodziani","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf4b8391013efab134c1a","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2700364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gina Niespodziani","original_name":"Gina Niespodziani","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf4be391013efab134c1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2700364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gina Niespodziani","original_name":"Gina Niespodziani","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf4c4c59a2db32dd028c7","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skinner","original_name":"Skinner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf55b9c686a460213466a","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4972489,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paul Romano","original_name":"Paul Romano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf576703e24dc7c134b1b","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4972490,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kearin Cooke","original_name":"Kearin Cooke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf58d7054006f60d0222c","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4972491,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Matt Carr, Jr","original_name":"Matt Carr, Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf59fc59a2db32dd02945","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4972491,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Matt Carr, Jr","original_name":"Matt Carr, Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf5c93a0f5a08c8f1a480","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4972494,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Lilianna Penagos","original_name":"Lilianna Penagos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf5d43a0f5a08c8f1a492","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4972495,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jaiden Wood","original_name":"Jaiden Wood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66faf5f8c59a2db32dd02963","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5540,"name":"heavy metal"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mastodon “Crack The Skye” 10th Anniversary Tour Film // 3 min Cut Down","key":"341625067","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-11T17:56:23.000Z","id":"66faf2f4391013efab134b7e"}]}}}
