According to this law, death row inmates are permanently exiled to a detention center, the Purgatory, built in abandoned nuclear power plants. With a degree of self-governance granted by the government, the Purgatory gradually reaches a point where it is beyond external control, leaving the government struggling to find a solution. Yu-seong, a police officer who became a death row inmate due to the revenge for his daughter and wife, is offered a deal by the Director of NIS. Now Yu-seong must eliminate the Purgatory Boss, the king of the center, in exchange for possible pardon.","popularity":0.52,"poster_path":"/9rSZsvNi9MtLXBhlFy0j83hmZ3v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Dethrone the king of death in a merciless realm of killers","title":"Purgatory: Zone of Murderers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1624033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Khan","original_name":"브루스 칸","popularity":0.2873,"profile_path":"/6BHU63N6Z2uNAQtj7GdZ7QKUYS8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66fb4e954955b4a206f161cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Chae-young","original_name":"이채영","popularity":0.3188,"profile_path":"/xwHPMSKQHo9iRBDDgdINDYBd9kb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66fb4e9bbe8ad187d5a65d4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cho Seong-ha","original_name":"조성하","popularity":0.7677,"profile_path":"/rVJRXGHjDSWkC58SgBYfMbeAm1t.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66fb4ec0e7811ef6cba6600c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1624033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Khan","original_name":"브루스 칸","popularity":0.2873,"profile_path":"/6BHU63N6Z2uNAQtj7GdZ7QKUYS8.jpg","credit_id":"66fb4e3bf17b887599d623eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188294,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lee Hyeon-Myeong","original_name":"Lee Hyeon-Myeong","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fb4e89f17b887599d623f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1260,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9rSZsvNi9MtLXBhlFy0j83hmZ3v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
