Razutis uses re-photography and camera movements that mimick the eye's 'saccadic eye movement' in revealing the visual sequence and interaction between daughter and father. The revelation is conducted over repeating sequences whose content is 'sampled' as if in the construction of a memory as puzzle.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Razutis","original_name":"Al Razutis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eOvTDCJIOJScts7DFt6igNsNMhV.jpg","credit_id":"66fc5ffff17b887599d65543","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
