However, tragedy strikes when our hapless heroine accidentally locks herself out of her house before work in a scandalous state of undress.  Luckily, her friendly but perpetually inebriated next-door neighbor, Curwen, is able to loan her something to wear, but her employer, Mr. Pickman, is less than thrilled with her attire and lack of punctuality. Will she be able to keep her job? Will she ever get back into her house?
