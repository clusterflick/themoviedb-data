The film consists of two parts made up of the same footage but narrated from two different, yet related, perspectives. The footage captures the activities of villagers in a Thai ceremonial tradition called 'Boon Bung Fai'. The objective of the ceremony, though quite forgotten, is to worship the sky and beg for the rain. The film explores juxtaposition between documentary and fiction; silence and sound; folk tale and modern-day news reporting, as well as relationships between man and nature, earth and sky, dream and reality, east and west, and most importantly, the past and the present that will lead us to the future.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2004-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Infinity and Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","original_name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc8cba348de1fabff229f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","original_name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc8ccb6c365985c8f229d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","original_name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc8ce47041d60f33d05724","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","original_name":"Sompot Chidgasornpongse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc8ced7041d60f33d05734","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494376,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nitipong Thinthupthai","original_name":"Nitipong Thinthupthai","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/d38IKrOSBpaHT1vOfoRrLWYcfuI.jpg","credit_id":"66fc8e436c365985c8f22a15","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929457,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Panu Trivej","original_name":"Panu Trivej","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc8e56e26a53c1225941a5","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"th","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
