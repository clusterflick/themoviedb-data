Women who did not want to submit to a male-dominated music industry and who used the 80s generation's liberation of the individual and sexuality to rebel against authority and societal norms. Women – Lise Cabble, Mette Soele Zachau Mathiesen, Lene Lykke Davidsen, Minna Grooss and the late Anne Vig Skoven – who, together with a number of other women in the years from 1975 to 1997, were first the punk/indie female band Clinic Q, which became pop/rock the band Miss B. Haven, which was successful far beyond Denmark's borders.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endeløs Nat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
