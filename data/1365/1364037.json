From this combined star power emerges a work of startling intimacy, which follows then-13-year-old Oumy’s choreographed movements through a studio set painted an underwater blue, as she dances in front of mirrors and salutes an imaginary audience. Under the blazing lights and swelling music, her performance recalls a screen test or dance film—but the resulting work breaks free from the proscenium frame typical of those genres. — Museum of
