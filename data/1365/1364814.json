As the story begins, the children are transported to a time when their great-grandfather and his brothers were kidnapped by slave traders. The narrative takes them through harrowing scenes of captivity, forced labor, and the oppressive lives of enslaved in the masters' plantations. It vividly depicts the cruel reality of children and women being exploited and mistreated. Amidst this hardship, the grandfather's tale reveals a powerful revolution against their masters, leading to self-liberation and the founding of their own village. The animated journey, rich in historical and cultural significance, ends on a note of gratitude and reverence for the ancestors' indomitable spirit and their fight for liberty.","popularity":0.4132,"poster_path":"/gKRYdvXBYKPevCNDfqEnujuhEcB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":240671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Donkosira","origin_country":""},{"id":240672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kerdoff Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A grandfather's haunting tale of enslavement and rebellion unfolds by a fire, revealing a family's harrowing journey from captivity to self-liberation.","title":"All Equal!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Sarfoh","original_name":"Nelson Sarfoh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Grandfather / Friend / Advisor 2 (voice)","credit_id":"66fc8138bae383c10cd05425","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Binja Zihhalirwa","original_name":"Binja Zihhalirwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Child 1 / Child 2 / Child 3 / Grandfather 2 / Young child (voice)","credit_id":"66fc821cbae383c10cd054d0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Kusambiza-Kiingi","original_name":"Adrian Kusambiza-Kiingi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Grandfather 3 / Village Chief / Man 2 / Commandant to the interpreter / Interpreter (voice)","credit_id":"66ff05706fc74e5756f7e782","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Crystal","original_name":"Astrid Crystal","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Wife / Noblewoman / Slave woman (voice)","credit_id":"66ff05e3fa3e69e0ef7ca237","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Macdonald Nkemda","original_name":"Macdonald Nkemda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Husband / Man 1 / Man 3 / Emissary / Chief of Nobles / Noble / Advisor / Man 4 (voice)","credit_id":"66ff07446fc74e5756f7e7d1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie Rodet","original_name":"Marie Rodet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc7ff87e90373237593f4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974879,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mamadou Sène Cissé","original_name":"Mamadou Sène Cissé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc802b7041d60f33d0540a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie Rodet","original_name":"Marie Rodet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc80e5df2aba95b3f22770","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Mendy","original_name":"Albert Mendy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff03f1c9a10d46ea7cacfb","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979268,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Youssou Mboup","original_name":"Youssou Mboup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff044267c6fb09fff7e942","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979272,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rassoul Niang","original_name":"Rassoul Niang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff049efa3e69e0ef7ca20e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979273,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pape Kane Diop","original_name":"Pape Kane Diop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff04b06fc74e5756f7e748","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979275,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kader Ouattara","original_name":"Kader Ouattara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff04e17830c1301e7c9d90","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3971510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheikh A.
