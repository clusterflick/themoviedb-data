Aman finds solace in his peculiar art form, using cigarettes and crayons to create art pieces,  The film culminates in a poignant scene at Aman's cremation, where Neha, in a symbolic gesture, tries to burn remnants of Aman's life. Their son Ayush, unaware of the depth of the moment, adds crayons to the funeral pyre, believing his father will need them to continue drawing in the afterlife. The film ends with Neha and Ayush walking away, leaving behind a powerful image of crayons and cigarettes burning together in the fire.\r Crayons is a meditation on love, loss, addiction, and the quiet, tender moments that shape a familyâ€™s journey through grief.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zkJ1Jy9GEijo0BurOvEz08mCtER.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nine
