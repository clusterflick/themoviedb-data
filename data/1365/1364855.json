The confrontation between supporters of an independent Ukraine and European integration on the one hand and «separatists» who wanted to join Russia on the other strongly affected the city of Kharkiv. In the film, the sounds of violence from the past break into scenes of the relatively peaceful life that followed. The public places in the city center of Kharkiv where activists fought some years ago were destroyed by Russian artillery in this year. The film was extended to include images of this destruction because the current war is a continuation of the outbreaks from the past and will forever change our future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ahyfPULipb8XruVgje3MR2FE5t4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regular Places","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykola Ridnyi","original_name":"Mykola Ridnyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc9fbbbae383c10cd05931","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ahyfPULipb8XruVgje3MR2FE5t4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
