Nikki Cano as \"Hot Lost Girl\", embarks on a journey to find her magic before sundown. Materialized as a holographic orb, her it-factor is not where she left it, posing a great threat to her sparkle and shine. With the help of a friend, an aimless spirit, and a very long landline cable, she navigates a fool's journey through Los Angeles. It is unclear if the people and things she meets along the way are clues or beautiful distractions as our main character attempts to decipher the difference between glitter and gold. But, she must work quickly before her magic disappears for good.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/RVMMxXsM4rD49GkbfpDSd0ar4Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240452,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perception
