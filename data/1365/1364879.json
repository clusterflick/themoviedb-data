To that end, he determines to find the slayer of Pedro Alvarez, who whispered before dying that his assailant was a woman. At the City Refuge for Homeless Girls, Clavering obtains the assistance of Margaret Holt, the sister of Victor Holt, the district attorney. Margaret, it is revealed, was abducted by Juanita, a member of a gang of white slavers led by Alvarez. After escaping from a brothel, Margaret became Alvarez' stenographer, hoping to gather secret information on his gang. While searching for evidence, Margaret was surprised by Alvarez, whom she killed. Finally, Clavering captures the gang, clears Margaret, and encourages her romance with cub reporter Jack Howell. This film is presumably lost.","popularity":0.197,"poster_path":"/uka9Pt5pGSKoo96ooM0GRW5EQyi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Conspiracy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":254114,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Emerson","original_name":"John Emerson","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/k4X2nu7187pg1ZwOCnW04eLOgLn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Winthrop Clavering","credit_id":"66fcaf977e9037323759465b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2371912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lois Meredith","original_name":"Lois Meredith","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/pDXuOlpZ3wM5CYLmHQu6SEXLL8b.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Margaret Holt","credit_id":"66fcafa57e90373237594661","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Lockwood","original_name":"Harold Lockwood","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/uyqlRj6IXQv1oX5pDJKKCgNSjMP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jack Howell","credit_id":"66fcafb27e90373237594679","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iva Shepard","original_name":"Iva Shepard","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/yqISLsJZz8zc4nrUlrKKdKUe3kF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Juanita","credit_id":"66fcafbfc6fbb2f0cdf22d8c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Byrne","original_name":"Francis Byrne","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Victor Holt","credit_id":"66fcafd1bae383c10cd05abc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1634101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Clarendon","original_name":"Hal Clarendon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Morton","credit_id":"66fcafdcbae383c10cd05ac2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368712,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dodson Mitchell","original_name":"Dodson Mitchell","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bill Flynn","credit_id":"66fcaff0df2aba95b3f22efe","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edouard Durand","original_name":"Edouard Durand","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Savelli","credit_id":"66fcb0027e90373237594688","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Dwan","original_name":"Allan Dwan","popularity":0.2253,"profile_path":"/kAvLKEkjOpOzQSEpvFrjF0b5Nq9.jpg","credit_id":"66fcaf076c365985c8f22e7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130899,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert M.
