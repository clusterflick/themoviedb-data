Intrigued by the story of a mysterious disappearance of a young woman Jane. Richard takes a room in the pub, the last place Jane was known to be alive. Awakened one night by an old telephone that seems to ring endlessly and then a chance encounter with the spectral image of a young woman, Richard decides to question the owner. Max an abstract artist denies ever seeing or putting up the woman in question. Richard is told 'The Telephone' must be in his imagination. Richard's instincts tell him there is more to the story. Is the ghostly figure seen late at night, that of Jane? Could the telephone ringing truly just be in his head? If you heard the ringing, would you be prepared to answer what lies at the end of the phone?","popularity":0.116,"poster_path":"/hS8b5kN75Nz4kQC4fh2YjOavwT4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fear The Call!","title":"The Telephone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Barber","original_name":"Nigel Barber","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/x28iFuA9LUBMxpWatTdUFPEXSIC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Max","credit_id":"66fc5f7a8aa734b376a69d39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2146514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Deegan","original_name":"Bernard Deegan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"66fc64456ec7804796d65cfd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Wheeldon","original_name":"Stuart Wheeldon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"66fc646f411656c0e4f19ada","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Wheeldon","original_name":"Stuart Wheeldon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc5f668aa734b376a69d2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Wheeldon","original_name":"Stuart Wheeldon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc64aa411656c0e4f19af4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5180374","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AuBeFwJSnGphmNsrdfXIdDEGnBa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1233,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hS8b5kN75Nz4kQC4fh2YjOavwT4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":822}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
