When I retired and our son graduated from 8th grade we decided we move back to New York, one day after dropping him off at school in the morning, my wife decided to drive me along a different route than we normally took, just for a change of scenery, and it happened to be something called Ocean Avenue. For about a mile and a half as we were driving, I had a sense of what the automobile has done to our cultures, not only in the U.S. but also elsewhere. At one time there might have been vital commercial centers where people also live, and in San Francisco that didn’t seem to be the case any longer.\" – Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/jGeE1UhNe1qqrVq2buol6tXeuXK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Auto-Collider XX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"629533cc76eecf75b0ac929a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGeE1UhNe1qqrVq2buol6tXeuXK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
