If our universe is infinite, then what is the likelihood of other life? Could there be other civilisations just like ours or is it possible that we are the only intelligent life anywhere in our vast and likely infinite universe. Conversations with leading thinkers from multiple disciplines reveal the latest in scientific research, in this engaging and visually stunning documentary film.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/dpTacP35i2H4NDU3hwce97RH9pj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flickapolitan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Infinite Universe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yWT6Iw21HC3vy7GiuzDQFWmbJU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dpTacP35i2H4NDU3hwce97RH9pj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
