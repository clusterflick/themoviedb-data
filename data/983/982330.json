Dolly, who is not acquainted with his sister, sends back her engagement ring. Sad and disconsolate, she saunters to the cliffs overlooking the seashore, trying to forget her imagined wrong. As she is climbing down the side of the rocky prominence, her foot slips and she falls into a narrow crevice. She finds herself helpless with a sprained ankle. Remembering George's returned match-case, she tears a piece of cloth from her skirt; writes with a burnt match a note, telling of her accident. She ties it around her shoe and throws it over the cliff to her collie dog Jean, who carries the missive to George, who at once, after summoning aid, goes to her rescue, accompanied by his sister.","popularity":0.3649,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Signal of Distress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Turner","original_name":"Florence Turner","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/h08KXju3kinUqw7RviRxB0ATLYG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dolly Dillard","credit_id":"629666605a469072f5f0cab5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Powers","original_name":"Tom Powers","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/Dril696LhsWrZMBjGqO1YUG2Md.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"George Gordon","credit_id":"62966671df86a834e234b2b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Halleran","original_name":"Edith Halleran","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"May - George's Sister","credit_id":"62966682ca83541353b37af3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morrison","original_name":"James Morrison","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/74FZiGds3xQqRB7Ee0WJLqMzee1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Stranger","credit_id":"629666925507e914925c4978","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean the Dog","original_name":"Jean the Dog","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ii7Vl7UvRZZmEhCfA1Eku8tysPC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jean, a Dog","credit_id":"629666b96ee3d700670cbad0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Trimble","original_name":"Laurence Trimble","popularity":0.0565,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296664c7e12f000991688f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0368271","wikidata_id":"Q3989278","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
