Her beauty is discovered by Madame's brother, George Martin, and she is made a model. One afternoon, she tries on a rejected bathing suit and by adding a touch here and there, makes it into a beautiful creation. Madame then sends her to the beach to carry out a clever advertising scheme. At the shore, Middy is pursued by a reporter and photographer, who have been commissioned by Madame to photograph the girl for calendar advertising. In her flight from the publicity men, Mildred takes refuge in a car owned by lawyer Philip Gordon, who gets into the vehicle and drives off with Middy. Middy has him drop her off where she doesn't live, and he ends up having to try to track her down.","popularity":0.4735,"poster_path":"/ckoQjw3LvH40gFnEqTSZTUEp6t2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7486,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Company","origin_country":""},{"id":555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mutual Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A pretty girl — a dashing bathing costume — and a photo of the two, reproduced on a calendar furnish the basis for one of the most enjoyable screen stories of the year.","title":"The Calendar Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Mannequin de chez Lizette Taquin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Day","original_name":"Juliette Day","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/kiWjnT2eFSsnvt2hQxCkVIA4WXH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mildred Manning","credit_id":"629577bccddbbc130ee9ecf6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashton Dearholt","original_name":"Ashton Dearholt","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/6OdDUJ3BBk5lLxCNSkO5WDrXtiJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Philip Gordon","credit_id":"629577e1a410c815a5494a17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarissa Selwynne","original_name":"Clarissa Selwynne","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/jrm9O5lWXqYOOsEw0DH3ovuHz0H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Madame Lizette","credit_id":"629577ff1e9225009cd9ca6e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1689725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lamar Johnstone","original_name":"Lamar Johnstone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bemomrIJwU6rvbBQDsWhIAHz4P3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"George Martin","credit_id":"62957816a44d0900a98c03a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Kirkham","original_name":"Kathleen Kirkham","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/511qexfY0jHo3dj8IJyvlD9AOCk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Paula Ware","credit_id":"6295782ea44d0900a98c0404","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3570641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Hanford","original_name":"Ruth Hanford","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Elvira Merriwell","credit_id":"6295784b3acd20009fa9a1c5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherry Hall","original_name":"Sherry Hall","popularity":0.1589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tom Andrews","credit_id":"62957866ca8354009a5c86b3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gough","original_name":"John Gough","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/5KozfanmuFmVS9orO7T0gdPWkEr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Wally Rand","credit_id":"62957879d48cee6d642e2061","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1300231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Drew","original_name":"Cora Drew","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/WgbFxrhGJQd3bsliBYCUdbRw4B.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Manning","credit_id":"6295788e5a4690510da7edf3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritzi Ridgeway","original_name":"Fritzi Ridgeway","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/vgU9bkOCXUpg7WJYKVJbqBUsjAo.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mazie","credit_id":"629578a45a4690510da7ee55","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rollin S.
