Nothing pulls harder at the heartstrings than an opera aria – that pivotal moment when the action stops and the character draws us right into the heart of the drama, revealing his or her innermost feelings and thoughts. These are chances for the singers to show off, to wow an audience with some of the most famous music in opera. In this film, charismatic conductor and music director of the Royal Opera House, Antonio Pappano, shares his selection of some of opera’s greatest arias. Pappano’s choices stretch across the full 400-year operatic canvas and feature some of the most ravishing and famous arias in the repertoire.","popularity":0.145,"poster_path":"/hKSGWPILDaYBaeax8U10EuTanNN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pappano's Greatest Arias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Pappano","original_name":"Antonio Pappano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/sUQ9lJlOJVBXm1DtWaqNaxUyOIa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"629690e1d71fb40051922582","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3571492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kelly Lynch","original_name":"Kelly Lynch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629691af6ee3d700a616a051","department":"Production","job":"Production Accountant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan Younghusband","original_name":"Jan Younghusband","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296916e5a469072f66832b8","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138162,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Boyd Nagle","original_name":"Boyd Nagle","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629691cefd6fa1006669a101","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Best","original_name":"Dominic Best","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629692de7e12f00065357dfa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Best","original_name":"Dominic Best","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629692f1fd6fa1006669a509","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Pappano","original_name":"Antonio Pappano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/sUQ9lJlOJVBXm1DtWaqNaxUyOIa.jpg","credit_id":"6296914ed48cee0d6f68c76d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2379244,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Branch","original_name":"Keith Branch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/gV0jmInT1ff635tqVPpyNEAtl82.jpg","credit_id":"629692135507e914925ccb1f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545489,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Plant","original_name":"Steve Plant","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296922e7e12f0004f43731f","department":"Crew","job":"Lighting Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3479600,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Celina Parker","original_name":"Celina Parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62969184cddbbc130d1a1e97","department":"Production","job":"Development Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2330407,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ged Murphy","original_name":"Ged Murphy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629692a309ed8f125557f66c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cooper","original_name":"Mark Cooper","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/l5xmotx7X1JVUQgwmgU60pnIOPB.jpg","credit_id":"629692bfd48cee0d6f68cd22","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3479602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mei Ye Li","original_name":"Mei Ye Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62969242ca83541355ced40d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hKSGWPILDaYBaeax8U10EuTanNN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
