It stars Harry Secombe as Samuel Pickwick and Roy Castle as Sam Weller.  This television production was based on the stage musical Pickwick which had been a commercial success. It was adapted for the screen by James Gilbert and Jimmy Grafton. The musical had premiered in the West End in 1963, again with Harry Secombe in the lead role.  Running at 90 minutes and made in colour, the TV musical again had lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and a score by Cyril Ornadel. The book was by Wolf Mankowitz and it was directed by Terry Hughes. The programme was first transmitted on 11 June 1969 and again on 26 December 1969. One of the better known songs from the score is \"If I Ruled the World\".  The cast of this production differed somewhat from that of the stage musical.","popularity":0.7992,"poster_path":"/8IV98UhRNesUc0PEKjmrDm17Tou.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The television version of the hit 1960s musical.","title":"Pickwick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Secombe","original_name":"Harry Secombe","popularity":0.1829,"profile_path":"/fs5AB7yXSAIx94BMWb9hTy9IztS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr Pickwick","credit_id":"6297f76499259c0051d3b05d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Castle","original_name":"Roy Castle","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/zyDCSW7wu5v0y8MAPyG6taPRkn7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sam Weller","credit_id":"6297f77b7ad08c0050052ce2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hattie Jacques","original_name":"Hattie Jacques","popularity":0.2764,"profile_path":"/n95sCWibvNbS3w4jnt8BwzK9ZrF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs Bardell","credit_id":"6297f790a44d095275e65344","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aubrey Woods","original_name":"Aubrey Woods","popularity":0.2058,"profile_path":"/jd9zRA44Dv93agCdjwcOb4fmyjm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alfred Jingle","credit_id":"6297f7acf8e9822560bb5ed5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Fraser","original_name":"Bill Fraser","popularity":0.2927,"profile_path":"/qPPzKA8mT9415cbll8pVaKkhVnQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Serjeant Buzzfuzz","credit_id":"6297f7c57e12f0004f4781da","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Orchard","original_name":"Julian Orchard","popularity":0.2123,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Augustus Snodgrass","credit_id":"6297f7dd09ed8f0ceff3fcf3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Dorning","original_name":"Robert Dorning","popularity":0.1905,"profile_path":"/8UmvWDlFuYp6dnEr6LAAQC5x72R.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tracy Tupman","credit_id":"6297f7f7f8e98225613ee51f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Trigger","original_name":"Ian Trigger","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nathaniel Winkle","credit_id":"6297f810d48cee2c44c1db60","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Hughes","original_name":"Terry Hughes","popularity":0.2199,"profile_path":"/3OQlHfxkaFptZjkM4rjW29kyqdP.jpg","credit_id":"6297f8d109ed8f0cf03a8478","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1626921","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8IV98UhRNesUc0PEKjmrDm17Tou.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zTLpgkTIJFOApNdIdJjxJG9R0aw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1198,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m1xXkNQWypdOLekCzxgk2HL5SdH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":802},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1198,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qnEPRIrwaoZkxSQ0Bgnw5oYU2Hr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":802},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1198,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3eJGIDczEf5ndpU5H8Pgr5TR6we.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":802}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"},{"id":10181,"name":"based on play or musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
