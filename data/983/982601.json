That trip has left him wounded. With a possessive mother, a young wife who despises him since her abandonment and a young son who does not know him, Héctor will try to adapt, proposing to live as before, repairing lost time, but he runs into a community that has already discarded him. His violent reaction breaks the fabric of his environment, and he discovers that since he left everything has changed, neither Héctor nor his community will be the same.","popularity":0.0574,"poster_path":"/89obenFh12AUwO4Ay20xPrd1FAH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Benuca Films","origin_country":""},{"id":124800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Concepción","origin_country":""},{"id":141310,"logo_path":"/mEItPOeXbJCQ6P5ylHB0vFm7GWi.png","name":"Cine Murciélago","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2022-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roza","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrés Rodríguez","original_name":"Andrés Rodríguez","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629777fadf86a834e237b5a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3104488,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fernando Montes de Oca","original_name":"Fernando Montes de Oca","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jyBK0IAMb8mcFcL8yskjba8pbVE.jpg","credit_id":"645ed487dbbb42013636274c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19710772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1127,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tpeJykVIRkjGx8rKXB6vI5VsxcI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1684,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/89obenFh12AUwO4Ay20xPrd1FAH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1191}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
