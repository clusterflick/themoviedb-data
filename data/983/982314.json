Little Tad, playing at the boat landing of the White House lake, falls into the water and is saved from drowning by a young fellow named Jasper Brinton. When young Brinton carries Tad into the White House, the president is very grateful to him and says if there is anything that he can do for him at any time he will be glad to do it. Young Brinton's mother is an enthusiastic supporter of the Federal cause, and when the war breaks out, she urges her son to join the Union army. He has an inherent dread of danger and naturally hesitates. He finally enlists. On the battlefield his natural fear takes possession of him.","popularity":0.2439,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Higher Mercy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Ince","original_name":"Ralph Ince","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/73Dd6TNh5Ji2JQsj63JoxJ53sbo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Abraham Lincoln","credit_id":"62965d47fd140b00a7169bbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","original_name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","popularity":0.1407,"profile_path":"/9xKPzh1DDCLFFh78c7l9SsOGe5r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Brinton","credit_id":"62965d637e403d0066822126","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morrison","original_name":"James Morrison","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/74FZiGds3xQqRB7Ee0WJLqMzee1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jasper Brinton, Mrs. Brinton's Son","credit_id":"62965d7709ed8f125356cc97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Tapley","original_name":"Rose Tapley","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/rwX3kI8L08zijmf8huOTzeW5QFt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Abraham Lincoln","credit_id":"62965d8dca835413546cf247","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Casey","original_name":"Kenneth Casey","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/80nGT9KLVWl0w0Cyh6tg9Tz4JCf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tad, Lincoln's Son","credit_id":"62965da209ed8f12547f9824","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Talmadge","original_name":"Norma Talmadge","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/h8ES1kk8EEByz34sKaWMDyB6Ntv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"62965db6a44d09005113c080","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1653159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Ashbrooke","original_name":"Florence Ashbrooke","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/uga2t8ooGpvkDvthiOP1IyUji6r.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Nurse","credit_id":"62965dc71e9225009cdc5c44","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Wilson","original_name":"Hal Wilson","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/o6v1TNGi5YqDeayaAB3UshIb8xF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"A Black Servant","credit_id":"62965ddcfd140b0069441b17","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William V.
