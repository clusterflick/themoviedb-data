The opera's libretto is based on Friedrich Schiller's 'The Maid of Orleans'. It tells the story of the French national hero Jeanne d'Arc, who defends her country against the English troops during the Hundred Years' War. Constantly torn between her humble roots, her love for King Charles VII and her heavenly task to fight for France, she gains eternal glory by giving her life in the final, victorious battle against England.","popularity":0.2358,"poster_path":"/cnf44hvxdEkK9ggwcvMAtgi5DFb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71714,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Regio di
