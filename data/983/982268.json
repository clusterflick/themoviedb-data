Kuniko's fiancé, Minakami, feels something that attracts him deeply towards Kayo. On the other hand, Kayo prays for the happiness of her best friend and marries a very ordinary man. However, at one point, this mediocre but increasingly ferocious husband died in an accident ... A triangular love story develops depicting a woman's heart that sways between love and morals. Based on a novel by Nobuko Yoshiya, there were originally two parts to the film (If Spring Comes & Fall Once Again), both supposed to be 85 minutes, but apparently what we have now is this 103-minute amalgam of the two.","popularity":0.6748,"poster_path":"/jUm3Wyx28Jd92qnT84WAGEe5GrZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54049,"logo_path":"/ilpJiYm2OInjZBkekd82bu8HrbP.png","name":"P.C.L.
