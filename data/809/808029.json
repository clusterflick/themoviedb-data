This documentary short takes us inside the title theater located on the Bowery, as it’s about to close its doors, with its caretakers ruefully looking back at the life that once was. Eric Lin’s poignant first film serves as a glimpse into the usually private—and, according to the Music Palace’s projectionist, “lonely”—operations of a theater, and mourns the loss of a once-vital movie-going locale.","popularity":0.1883,"poster_path":"/qucQj68uDCiEdnVs86VVQuUncDA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Palace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ho Ying Pang","original_name":"Ho Ying Pang","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Manager","credit_id":"6055432f5c071b0029c340ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jian Bang Wang","original_name":"Jian Bang Wang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Assistant Manager","credit_id":"6055433b6f6a99002877092b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Butterman","original_name":"David Butterman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Projectionist","credit_id":"605543464083b3006bd12d67","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Lin","original_name":"Eric Lin","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605542e25c071b00546832d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016819,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Arthur Keung","original_name":"Arthur Keung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605543ae6f6a99006b249453","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016821,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Aaron Ng","original_name":"Aaron Ng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605543b74083b3006bd12eb8","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016807,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kam Lau","original_name":"Kam Lau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605542f4ab1bc7003da464d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016816,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Brian Ferguson","original_name":"Brian Ferguson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6055437ff5cb21006b2009df","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016817,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wonsuck Woo","original_name":"Wonsuck Woo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6055438bfd4f80005421eecb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Lin","original_name":"Eric Lin","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605542d40792e1006b2d7bc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0810428","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qucQj68uDCiEdnVs86VVQuUncDA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1788,"name":"chinatown"},{"id":5890,"name":"community"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"English, Cantonese","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
