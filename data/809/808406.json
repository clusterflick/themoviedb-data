Ten years later, the boys--now men in their 20's--are reunited with the survivors they met earlier. They engage in thought-provoking discussion on the nature of music and Holocaust and the effect the earlier experience has had on their lives.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/jErDxZ45bGtwVF18sUql87eooPs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Journey of Butterfly: The Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert E.
