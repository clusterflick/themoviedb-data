This erasure, together with the economic situation, pushes the men and women to return to the water to survive. The image as a representation of the memory of a place, of an inner landscape, of a mystery. A narrative that belongs to the world of exegesis, to an infinite world of relationships, of networks where each image enters into correspondence with another, opening up the meaning ever more and breaking the unity of history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Busy with infinity, they fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Corrandin","original_name":"Enrico Corrandin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6057e4e06e3deb006ba6bc9c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donato Corrandin","original_name":"Donato Corrandin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6057e4eb47c9fb0053be5036","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Barani","original_name":"Christian Barani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057e2b7fd4f800074bba599","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Barani","original_name":"Christian Barani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057e2c0e16e5a003c6b8d05","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Barani","original_name":"Christian Barani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057e2a56f6a99006b282656","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1997-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
