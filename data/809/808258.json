Can we refresh a film, as we say of a computer screen? One can for example say the film, tell its manufacture and its hazards during a conference. Traité d'optique is a film conference that questions the conditions of possibility of a film revival by crossing material culture and utopia, media archaeology and family narrative, about a study film made in 1987. If the conference sometimes replaces the film, can the film itself be a conference?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mNrJT8rU6osVsKIHR2PMmymQf56.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traité d'optique","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1581929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Érik Bullot","original_name":"Érik Bullot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/aak3tH6EzilI0MGORvbYQkRGZrH.jpg","credit_id":"6055fb2f223a8b003e464904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":901,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mNrJT8rU6osVsKIHR2PMmymQf56.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
