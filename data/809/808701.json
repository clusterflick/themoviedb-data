As a result, a notable producer tasks Aigner to shoot a sequel. The making of the film turns out to be a disaster. As the entire film crew rebels against the director’s growing delusions of grandeur, he finds himself confronted with the antagonists of his own fiction: Morgenstern and Boyd. They suck him into a spiral of sexual obsessions and omnipotent fantasies, at the end of which there can only be the failure of the film or death itself.","popularity":0.1514,"poster_path":"/2OUHjoZHOvX9gEwNLUXeIhn1IGb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":162,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
