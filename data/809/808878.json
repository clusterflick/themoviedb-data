Employees include Sybill and Windy, pale young women who toil endlessly at the pulp vats, and the more mature Helen, who is past breeding age. As Ari sits astride his beloved chimney, a Care-Giving Woman appears and offers a rooster to Taryn. The crows of this beast cause ecstatic, erotic disquietude in anyone within ear-shot. The cottage becomes a tropical whirlwind of desire until Helen manages to drown the rooster in the bubbling pulp.","popularity":0.1379,"poster_path":"/zr6yLEAAJxaTrcebY71RscS4HgR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cock Crew","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darcy Fehr","original_name":"Darcy Fehr","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/pNFSuPYFL74PsBMzzVE1A3IHEx6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ari","credit_id":"605836e588055100296111d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan McIvor","original_name":"Megan McIvor","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"605836f38805510029611212","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krista Morrison","original_name":"Krista Morrison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Care-Giving Woman","credit_id":"60583702b39e35006ab4e6bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Marchildon","original_name":"Micheline Marchildon","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/wX2t67YpHA40sc4e96LsM7hzSnP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sybill","credit_id":"6058371401e4d10053647569","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2166398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Toles","original_name":"Rachel Toles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Windy","credit_id":"60583721e16e5a0028115dbd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2967880,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Michael Powell","original_name":"Michael Powell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Tarryn","credit_id":"6058372de16e5a0028115dd4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145600,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Toles","original_name":"George Toles","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/j0Pq7IvjE8TmH2MT6MSMRmTRfNg.jpg","credit_id":"60583572af2da8003edfd0a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031823,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Wanda Farian","original_name":"Wanda Farian","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6058359b9ae613003f0aad17","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Maddin","original_name":"Guy Maddin","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/hF15rfnugsLQJfa6R1AvVAX7bEu.jpg","credit_id":"6058355647c9fb0053bed7c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Maddin","original_name":"Guy Maddin","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/hF15rfnugsLQJfa6R1AvVAX7bEu.jpg","credit_id":"6058357e4557a0005214c187","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caelum Vatnsdal","original_name":"Caelum Vatnsdal","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6058358bfd4f80003e07f8c2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Maddin","original_name":"Guy Maddin","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/hF15rfnugsLQJfa6R1AvVAX7bEu.jpg","credit_id":"605835689ae613006ae31fce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0233468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zr6yLEAAJxaTrcebY71RscS4HgR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
