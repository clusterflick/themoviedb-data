He crosses the ballot card with a fervent hope and resolve that his country deserves an overall transformation, including a new constitution, new leadership that drives the country towards progress and a fresh political culture that unites the people towards progress. Upon casting his maiden vote, he goes for a stroll to discover an area he had not hitherto seen in his own neighborhood and of himself. He wonders if the vote he just casted is by chance or choice. Perplexed by this question and lost in a labyrinth of newly discovered neighborhood and his own thoughts on democracy, motherland and patriotism, he fumbles to find his way back home. A story of one man's self-discovery and his quest to find his political self in a climate of uncertainty amidst forces of misfortune and misery created by the recent pandemic.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","name":"Sri Lanka"}],"release_date":"2020-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Virgin Vote: In a Time of a Pandelection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3017661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Udan Fernando","original_name":"Udan Fernando","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6055f7bdab1bc7006b7bacc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
