After a lifetime of anonymity, videos of Leonardo declaiming authorial verses surfaced online and reached millions of views and even gave birth to a book transcribed by fans. In 2019, at the age of 74, the illiterate poet reflects on life, nature and homesickness, while scholars of popular culture try to explain the media and linguistic phenomenon that is his life and work.","popularity":0.0462,"poster_path":"/swBnPDqduTifFlsppNzzYzktqLL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jefferson Sousa Comunicação","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leonardo Bastião, The Illiterate Poet","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardo Bastião","original_name":"Leonardo Bastião","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60569528223a8b006c856037","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernardo Ferreira","original_name":"Bernardo Ferreira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60569535caab6d00530e52fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcos Nunes","original_name":"Marcos Nunes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"605695410792e1006b2f5004","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saulo Passos","original_name":"Saulo Passos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6056954ba294f0003cad91a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zé Adalberto","original_name":"Zé Adalberto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60569554223a8b00548c88ab","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018309,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"José Robernito","original_name":"José Robernito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605694930792e10028ed83a2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018309,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"José Robernito","original_name":"José Robernito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605694730792e1003d60eac1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thiago Barros","original_name":"Thiago Barros","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605694ef4083b300297f738a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jefferson Sousa","original_name":"Jefferson Sousa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6056934ca294f000699bccb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernardo Ferreira","original_name":"Bernardo Ferreira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605695058c44b9002a69ce62","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jefferson Sousa","original_name":"Jefferson Sousa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6056935c4083b3005648125a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thiago Barros","original_name":"Thiago Barros","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605694d901e4d1006a23430f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018307,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitor Ribeiro","original_name":"Vitor Ribeiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6056941b2ac49900756d1053","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10200044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/hnBNmVmxYjny5zhbQv0jtGOlmED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/swBnPDqduTifFlsppNzzYzktqLL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer oficial | Leonardo Bastião, o poeta analfabeto","key":"NpkYlRiWNXE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-22T01:05:38.000Z","id":"605691c1c14fee007472ce92"}]}}}
