Participating in the revival of this comic opera are Miguel Ángel Gómez-Martínez, the veteran musical director, who considers Gaztambide to be “interesting, enjoyable and the holder of an extraordinary musical quality”, and Marco Carniti, the stage director, who wants to make us enjoy the beauty of a work which cheerfully veers between dream and reality. The libretto has been completely revamped and the action moved to Rome in the 1950s.
