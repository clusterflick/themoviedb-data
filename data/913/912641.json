The show introduces us to a number of characters – Jonathan, Greg, Syd, and Mario whose relationships are tested when Jonathan gets infected; Dino, an HIV-positive teen whose status is discovered through a contraction of tuberculosis; Mary Rose, a mother who unknowingly passed down the virus to her son after getting it from her husband; a gay beauty parlor employee experiencing work-related discrimination, and more. Their stories of love, pain, and acceptance are revealed through Dr. Gemma Almonte, who is studying the spread of the devastating virus.","popularity":0.2001,"poster_path":"/frdXlI8IOAfMoAgyfuiZX4VVXIx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philippine Educational Theater Association","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2020-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under My Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":278926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cherry Pie Picache","original_name":"Cherry Pie Picache","popularity":0.2661,"profile_path":"/rKMoeZIUsSrVEbA4oMeq8zZ00RN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Gemma Almonte","credit_id":"61aec4e5af85de00642ee97b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gio Gahol","original_name":"Gio Gahol","popularity":0.1521,"profile_path":"/1mE79kDjpnBp6uWtyzAQNlcbo2s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Greg","credit_id":"61aec4f8a242320089aae428","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Liwag","original_name":"Mike Liwag","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/jyxe0lSQ1lW3LBWdTKQUKbLvN6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jonathan","credit_id":"61aed244ac617c0042951c8b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dudz Teraña","original_name":"Dudz Teraña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Comedy Bar Singer","credit_id":"61aed2de35c30a008aac90bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitsi Pagaspas","original_name":"Kitsi Pagaspas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Aling Loida","credit_id":"61aed2f035c30a0042bcb47e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eko Baquial","original_name":"Eko Baquial","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Syd","credit_id":"61aed3085bce9e0091d05ce6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Ray Talon","original_name":"Dylan Ray Talon","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/mSDwB7clQ3yDRuW3SmrOs1eOvc2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dino","credit_id":"61aed35238765100429626e0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191056,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rody Vera","original_name":"Rody Vera","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/vY6iK4z28ncWMFhBOyHqSidN82d.jpg","credit_id":"61aec5b3a24232001c757dfa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvin Lee","original_name":"Melvin Lee","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61aec5a1387651001d6b54ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":"tl","file_path":"/frdXlI8IOAfMoAgyfuiZX4VVXIx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1152}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PETA's Under My Skin (Review Trailer)","key":"RDu9zH8lPe0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-27T07:00:10.000Z","id":"61aec63f6d97e60063eed532"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PETA present Rody Vera's Under My Skin | Excerpt","key":"sIm9mnUkyjI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-12-03T09:14:30.000Z","id":"61aec65443494f0098d2b42e"}]}}}
