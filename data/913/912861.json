Rob and his best friend Craig (Cassius) must then try to get Wyatt ready for the show, or -if things don’t work out- hide the body and find a replacement. Before the night is over, they’ll have to deal with a lovesick Casca, a sledgehammer-wielding Antony, and a stray Nick Bottom who has been kidnapped from the rival high school’s Midsummer.  The filmed version of the Shakespeare in the Dark production of “Et Tu, Rob?” combines the best elements of live theatre, film, and streaming to bring the \"cultural\" \"phenomenon\" to homes around the world for a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime
