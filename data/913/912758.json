Fifty years later, directors Karim Debbagh and Jay Bulgur retrace his steps, capturing many of the same pieces of music – which are handed down from one generation to the next – on film. A mysterious soundscape of musical rituals, dealing with fertility, birth, circumcision, grief, coming of age, marriage, divorce, life, death and art, it is both a historical record and, thanks to the elevating nature of the music, food for the soul.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Their Heads are Green and Their Hands are Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karim Dabbagh","original_name":"Karim Dabbagh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61af5ccb6dea3a0089b225e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Bulger","original_name":"Jay Bulger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5uQDjbt4u8Jcoh6f2Yg2773RVAt.jpg","credit_id":"61af5cc3e263bb0091dca0f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
