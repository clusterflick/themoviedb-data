Personal reflections mix with realities that sometimes change the filmmakerâ€™s perception of the world. A constant return to locations that have been walked through. The observation of a changed world caused by a pandemic -in terms of shifting colours. Seasonal colour that are perceived quite differently by the human eye, the deceleration of planet earth have also alternated the spring of 2021. A question about the the future path of our society and a way to rethink our connection to nature.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/nrZ5mSQs0yurlzQTd51EfnmgEP2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"yesterday and yesterday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Dietrich","original_name":"Michael Dietrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334a38378570e007c31cf74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrZ5mSQs0yurlzQTd51EfnmgEP2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica Selection","release_date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Simultan Festival program - Things of state unstable","release_date":"2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
