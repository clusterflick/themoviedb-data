Here a group of rapists are required to confront their victims face-to-face. The film concentrates on the bitter verbal sparring session between assaulter Richard (Graham Bechel) and assaultee Rebecca (Dianne Weist). Director Donald Wrye co-wrote the screenplay for Face of Rage with Hal Sitowicz, drawing much of the dialogue from real-life transcripts. The film was first aired as an \"ABC Theatre\" presentation on March 20, 1983, preceded with an all too appropriate \"parental guidance\" proviso.","popularity":2.3374,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12077,"logo_path":"/s6p5INYKlo6gD6RFXlm9ACA2VVj.png","name":"Viacom Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":176162,"logo_path":"/gk4tb53F2nl3a0xcUNCYrlPIktC.png","name":"ABC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Face of Rage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dianne Wiest","original_name":"Dianne Wiest","popularity":1.3697,"profile_path":"/p9mfzY68FtEbedOMNB5X4eBShhx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rebecca Hammil","credit_id":"61ad41852bcf67004128df62","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Beckel","original_name":"Graham Beckel","popularity":0.5075,"profile_path":"/duFny0c11zVA37XG1bHFTNOCvRG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rich","credit_id":"61ad419e2634620019d6628a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey DeMunn","original_name":"Jeffrey DeMunn","popularity":1.0969,"profile_path":"/eSouAAduXaziFpqLw59AG55jtGY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeff Hammil","credit_id":"61ad41b007a808005fc2b9c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Dzundza","original_name":"George Dzundza","popularity":1.1616,"profile_path":"/wmnQQn0dFygl90M2N8tlWlpGHzV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"61ad41bf534661008b122e2e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Glover","original_name":"Danny Glover","popularity":1.4787,"profile_path":"/yjow3MJDkgQuHx1fCpo4FZmXZcq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gary","credit_id":"61ad41cde10f46001c15e4f5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Glover","original_name":"John Glover","popularity":0.9866,"profile_path":"/aPmq20MXqFALrUxaaJoC2Xonumo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61ad41d7326c19008abc1409","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Goodman","original_name":"John Goodman","popularity":4.1878,"profile_path":"/yyYqoyKHO7hE1zpgEV2XlqYWcNV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fred","credit_id":"61ad41e4d207f300923cd1ae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3337196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mat Hames","original_name":"Mat Hames","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Singer in Band","credit_id":"61ad42201495650084830950","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1476863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melanie Haynes","original_name":"Melanie Haynes","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/xrkiTTh9KTikz3hWouk6YAGeECF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Wilson","credit_id":"61ad422f15dea0004170b20b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Szarabajka","original_name":"Keith Szarabajka","popularity":0.7357,"profile_path":"/z45Goe7lfBvs3cBP5igsCE8ISWG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"61ad424326346200418445ec","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Toussaint","original_name":"Lorraine Toussaint","popularity":0.8291,"profile_path":"/ali9XSMkZ0uAQLkmK0PoHXhJS0t.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Stendah","credit_id":"61ad425507a808001a1c0810","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas G.
