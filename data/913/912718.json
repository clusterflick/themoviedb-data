But how can we measure his legacy, 35 years after his death and 100 years after his birth? From Montreal to New Carlisle, L'Actualité journalist Guillaume Bourgault-Côté crosses Quebec to meet certain relatives, colleagues, experts and artists who rubbed shoulders with the man, literally and figuratively. Together, they try to identify what remains of René Lévesque. By traveling through Quebec, we will better understand the legacy left by René Lévesque 100 years after his birth, 35 years after his death: his role in the sovereignist movement, the development of public and economic policies, but also the strength of his personality, which still today arouses a feeling of deep attachment among the Quebec population, regardless of political allegiances.
