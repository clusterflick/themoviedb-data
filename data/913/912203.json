In this heavenly place, one of the most memorable battles of the Second World War took place 80 years ago. On December 7, 1941, at 7:53 am, a Japanese air squadron struck the American fleet which anchored in the waters of Pearl Harbor. The United States were struck at the heart of their defensive system and entered the conflict the very next day. How Pearl Harbor changed the face of World War II and therefore the face of the world? What are the diplomatic undersides of Pearl Harbor? Was the attack really a surprise attack? Is it really a Japanese victory?","popularity":0.3424,"poster_path":"/1nhgrWso51xkQXnr8iPAicpE7DJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142916,"logo_path":"/8y4LVHK9vevxkEMSWCWR2yFwufc.png","name":"Mediatika","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":66331,"logo_path":"/n2gAOEA4q6bUiaHwo2mKWHGA1wm.png","name":"Bonne Pioche","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pearl Harbor, le monde s'embrase","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Lindon","original_name":"Vincent Lindon","popularity":0.5999,"profile_path":"/tjRKMKfsIH7MrqtN7cMPIZubSXa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61ad21b05e14e5001db0e5de","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":308811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Korn-Brzoza","original_name":"David Korn-Brzoza","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ad217ad207f3001c09e836","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1503662,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olivier Wieviorka","original_name":"Olivier Wieviorka","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/s5feiziYDCkQbZRQ2XjSQr5VZ2e.jpg","credit_id":"61ad219557530e001a15d63d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16375928","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g1bTgnfn71M46htWN1NzxTCZ2uk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1nhgrWso51xkQXnr8iPAicpE7DJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3eUVzuJdVr18mDe9OuOH88usEUM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":3365,"name":"pearl harbor"},{"id":206828,"name":"pacific  ocean"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La une","release_date":"2021-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"10","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 2","release_date":"2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
