Sweetness and love reverse the succession of events, postponing the obvious consequences of the pathology that holds Antonio prisoner, and creating an unexpected life, told by the subjective eyes of a little puppet of Pinocchio, Antonioâ€™s faithful friend since childhood. That is how a tale of Pinocchio develops, but backwards: a child who turns into a puppet as the disease progresses.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/wRxdncgD6NSaqBAZhDfe9yHIltq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antonio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emiliano De Martino","original_name":"Emiliano De Martino","popularity":0.1559,"profile_path":"/3s0HiSlKgkFqU65V2W5I9nE3qN0.jpg","credit_id":"61acd3f16eecee001c2b100c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/wRxdncgD6NSaqBAZhDfe9yHIltq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Napoli Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Laceno d'oro","release_date":"2021-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
