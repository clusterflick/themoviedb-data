I have interpreted the story and it’s queer undertones by casting Dorian as a young woman discovered by a fashion photographer, then catapulted into the world of empty celebrity. She falls under the tutelage of a famous drag queen and becomes a nightclub luminary, constantly followed by the paparazzi. These media images become the infamous portrait, grotesquely mutating as she grows more beautiful and famous, culminating in her own narcissistic destruction.","popularity":0.0783,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorian, a cinematic perfume","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2326702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Handelman","original_name":"Michelle Handelman","popularity":0.3811,"profile_path":"/2hmYmMWGeXMzaIZzYRn95bxpxfv.jpg","credit_id":"61af75141684f7001cc4577c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12748036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
