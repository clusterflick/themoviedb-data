Pandey is the peon for the District Forest Officer, and his wife and Gauri assist him in cooking, and cleaning the officer's living quarters. When Jain retires, he is replaced by a much younger officer, Vikas Kashyap, whose family, consisting of two married brothers, their wives, and his widowed mother, live a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay. Vikas takes over the job, and a few days later his mother also comes to live there. Gauri falls in love with Vikas, and is convinced that he, too, is in love with her. She even undertakes the Karva Chauth Vrath - little realizing that Vikas is in love with London-based Sonia, and their marriage will soon be finalized.","popularity":0.1384,"poster_path":"/fqAx486DQ1LlkCDSOhJ33cjwHV8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117118,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Horizons Film","origin_country":""},{"id":66728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rajshri Productions","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1980-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manokaamnaa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urmila Bhatt","original_name":"Urmila Bhatt","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":"/o8Wmx38BNH9pRLoxd0rH1q6rhWP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Kashyap","credit_id":"61ac8f53aa659e00630a1579","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1108794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shail Chaturvedi","original_name":"Shail Chaturvedi","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Anwar Hussain","credit_id":"61ac8f70aa659e008e00b709","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalpana Iyer","original_name":"Kalpana Iyer","popularity":0.2553,"profile_path":"/iLOrpvFpdHNM81If6Kn3pWwtoay.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sonia","credit_id":"61ac8f79263462004183431d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gajanan Jagirdar","original_name":"Gajanan Jagirdar","popularity":0.1485,"profile_path":"/mQ5Pt118Gx8sxUslMhPWVCdgOgf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jain","credit_id":"61ac8f8238e5100096724427","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.P.
