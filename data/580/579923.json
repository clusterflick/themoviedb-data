In 1921, the Welsh mining town was devastated by the double murder of two schoolgirls when eight-year-old Freda Brunell and 11-year-old Florence Little were killed just weeks apart by a local boy, 15-year-old Harold Jones, who the Abertillery residents still refer to as their 'Dark Son'.","popularity":0.1541,"poster_path":"/dU9dFiLESNFTWTl1Ef9Heh7EJee.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":75884,"logo_path":"/2aaOxLblyFhf0a8C4fkgaYWqjIo.png","name":"Monster Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wilson","original_name":"David Wilson","popularity":0.1938,"profile_path":"/77KHZgPd9IcFxL2nYMq25KMPlBN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d925628258fc0054b73a9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2472405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Malton","original_name":"Jackie Malton","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/A2A89RVTC0wbtcINJGeDCtByVA3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d92581d9554b004c399736","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1138030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Howard","original_name":"David Howard","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf76cf09251416737ba9f1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10085486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dU9dFiLESNFTWTl1Ef9Heh7EJee.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Relesead by BBC on TV and online iPlayer","release_date":"2019-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
