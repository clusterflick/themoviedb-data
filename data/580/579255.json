In the film a young man begins to explore this world  and finds himself steeped in silence and in the vastness of space. He has a feeling of serenity which he naively endeavours to capture. But the climate of Holland always seeks revenge.  Serenity gradually gives way to despair against the backdrop of the bare landscape with no shelter to offer. The very same reasons which explain the polderâ€™s charm now become responsible for a hostile attitude : the vastness becomes oppressive, paradise becomes a hell.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54589,"logo_path":"/u2Nzm5sMLURwWxmvbLuPsXM8Giz.png","name":"Sluizer Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clair-Obscur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jules Royaards","original_name":"Jules Royaards","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5304300e0a2601d6cc0235","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Sluizer","original_name":"George Sluizer","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":"/1HlwIkG0HgzEdM0DZywCPW2ChFy.jpg","credit_id":"5c5303fc9251410e0a6372a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290024,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Staugaard","original_name":"Peter Staugaard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c530410c3a3684793990045","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477528,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Tholen","original_name":"Tom Tholen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c53041d92514151a95e7e97","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12749208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
