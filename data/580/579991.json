She seems to know a lot about Gabriele, whom at the same time is intrigued by this woman who doesn't speak Italian but she seems to understand everything that happens around her. Once she leaves, she gives a weak clue to Gabriele: her name and Tolmin, the name of a locality at the borders between Italy and Slovenia. Gabriele can't help it and goes to look for her, taking a journey that will bring him to the truth about his parents, himself and this woman who threw his calm life into confusion.","popularity":0.1188,"poster_path":"/lRnzL3EwqSw7mpo1smPaDzG57mS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Betty Wrong
