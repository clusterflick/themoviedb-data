A voice, enigmatic and sometimes uncertain, foretells of, relates and recalls the routine processes of injustice and their legacy: the creation of a diaspora of household objects, scattered amongst buildings that no longer exist. As the camera probes the secrets of ordinary spaces, streets and buildings around the city of Berlin, semblances of a person and a history begin to emerge and coalesce.","popularity":0.071,"poster_path":"/svNirhKw38H7dru9oflsYQpEMHu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Parts of a Folding Screen","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304690,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthea Kennedy","original_name":"Anthea Kennedy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0c047f8586780018be57a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Wiblin","original_name":"Ian Wiblin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0c048d68b1ea00137b3bb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8436416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/svNirhKw38H7dru9oflsYQpEMHu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
