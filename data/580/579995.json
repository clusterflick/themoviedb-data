Drawing on my own extensive Super 8 archive and a growing body of Mini DV footage the film portrays a fragmented and nostalgic view of a part of the world that has proved vital to the very fabric of my existence.  Amongst the sonic flotsam and jetsam lie littoral truths, half-truths and coastal myths. Both melancholic and absurd the ‘coastcard’ is a confusing missive from a place of hope.  It is a reminisce and flawed celebration. Hastings as a place where both memories and people are pulled towards the sea in a strange state of ‘reverse evolution’.\" – Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgeland Mutter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iain Sinclair","original_name":"Iain Sinclair","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/itd7Mqaid9fsYnGZGCOhMpQdWWJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5811da9251410e1d518361","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Kötting","original_name":"Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.2099,"profile_path":"/trIfQwhe7BsJpgqpTCdXsMxBtv3.jpg","credit_id":"5c58119ec3a3680b57894405","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iain Sinclair","original_name":"Iain Sinclair","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/itd7Mqaid9fsYnGZGCOhMpQdWWJ.jpg","credit_id":"5c5811ce0e0a2601d6d3fec7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
