A man with this name dies twice – once in 1969, in Israel, and a second time in 1987, in Innsbruck. This goes unnoticed, at first. In 2010, when a relative in London leaves a house as inheritance, the question arises both in Israel and in Innsbruck: Who was Ernst Beschinsky really?  A true story, told by numerous forged documents and many authentic reports.","popularity":0.0596,"poster_path":"/fySx5iitQTDkydJb9Ze0yiooZ9F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Only Die Twice","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Ata met rak pa'amayim","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Πεθαίνεις μονάχα δυο φορές","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Mann Der Zweimal Starb","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Umiera się tylko dwa razy","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Umierasz tylko dwa razy","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Só Se Morre Duas Vezes","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yair Lev","original_name":"Yair Lev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ca21ab6c3a368735b85a63b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Deri","original_name":"David Deri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/59HzapYUFgJtxh1eNT518Vall98.jpg","credit_id":"622e5b5f9c24fc0019d73aa4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Deri","original_name":"David Deri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/59HzapYUFgJtxh1eNT518Vall98.jpg","credit_id":"622e5b6fa6fdaa007328eb54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978290,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yair Lev","original_name":"Yair Lev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e5b845f622b007c984477","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584711,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markus Glaser","original_name":"Markus Glaser","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e5ba0498bc20079214f5e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Deri","original_name":"David Deri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/59HzapYUFgJtxh1eNT518Vall98.jpg","credit_id":"622e5bb34e4dff00451c8481","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","original_name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e5bc19d2b6300789375e6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978290,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yair Lev","original_name":"Yair Lev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca21a67c3a368734485d1be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8497762","wikidata_id":"Q54806796","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/najsn98i5haREdqwHatMDUIQigP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/85hRjUUP4z9lmW8Xi3s4PqeFIOK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fySx5iitQTDkydJb9Ze0yiooZ9F.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1754},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1654,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mabpq1d7F6wqtrxHcwUqpYuYKU9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qoIRa0wGNpfHqFWum64Lc0OuWOP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
