The 400 year-old store owner had begun to face some difficult times. Upholding quality, craftsmanship, a dwindling demand for Kyo-Ningyo had culminated into difficulty running a retail space while maintaining the same level of commitment. Eventually the store owner’s decision to close his store had a profound and introspective effect on visvim founder Hiroki Nakamura which led to the creation of this film.  The multi-region DVD is available at F.I.L. stores across Japan and Asia.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/nc6Gu2THocT3kFAUYh3gHoFldqg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suitman Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cycle of Craftsmanship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Young Kim","original_name":"Young Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5568a50e0a2601d6cf73a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232616,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Kwan","original_name":"Julia Kwan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5568c90e0a263ccde0e4b8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232619,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mook Denton","original_name":"Mook Denton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5568da925141544861610d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232620,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Wate","original_name":"John Wate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5568ebc3a36805e882360a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232622,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Noriaki Saito","original_name":"Noriaki Saito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5568f90e0a265e19d26afa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Hartley","original_name":"Nick Hartley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c55690dc3a368302882a1b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232626,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kinji Kayanuma","original_name":"Kinji Kayanuma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c55691bc3a36805e8823647","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232627,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tadashi Nakada","original_name":"Tadashi Nakada","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5569380e0a263ccde0e523","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232629,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kana Wakabayashi","original_name":"Kana Wakabayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c55695cc3a36847779d58eb","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232631,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Richard Weston","original_name":"Richard Weston","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c55696d0e0a26031bc62381","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":801,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nc6Gu2THocT3kFAUYh3gHoFldqg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
