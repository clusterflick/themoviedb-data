The women directors wanted to amke the voices of those men who fled the hell of war and who are now seeking asylum be heard. Always with modesty, sometimes poetically, Adam and his friends allow us to see their sufferings but also their joy punctuated with hopes and disillusions. Through these images with contrasting emotions, ASMA questions and reveals the dignity and humanity of those we call \"migrants\". Driven by their dreams, they wanted to testify to exist. May we listen to them.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalian Lo","original_name":"Kalian Lo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c54a22a9251410e246671e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Casari","original_name":"Olivia Casari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c54a21b0e0a2612ccd462bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Casari","original_name":"Dominique Casari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c54a246c3a36847939b6f84","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1729,"name":"migration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bande-annonce documentaire ASMA","key":"TEv-jWILX08","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2018-11-04T10:58:20.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c54a3f19251410e24667400"}]}}}
