In the films, Pieter touches on the struggles of poverty, drug use, loneliness and loss. But he more accurately captures the spirit of renewal, peace and serenity in the lives of the people he documents through stunning landscapes and intimate oral histories. Hungry Horse: Legends of the Everyday follows the mythical structure of its subjects' lives, Charlie, Katie and Brad Lee, and it is through their stories, and Pieter's powerful imagery that we learn about the timeless cycle of adventure, loss and renewal.","popularity":0.0591,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hungry Horse: Legends of the Everyday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770052,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pieter Ten Hoopen","original_name":"Pieter Ten Hoopen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d935f8b6c2641155f22370","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1706480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arkasha Stevenson","original_name":"Arkasha Stevenson","popularity":0.2974,"profile_path":"/a6wsFI0sdD4n9wALBIryOLuGsPj.jpg","credit_id":"6610118f3e6f2b01643929bf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Storm","original_name":"Brian Storm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c530a090e0a2662a4cf3797","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
