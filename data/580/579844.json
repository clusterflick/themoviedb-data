Machine-gun crew of Hanpasha Nuradilov destroyed almost a thousand soldiers and officers of the enemy in an unequal battle, showing an example of selfless courage and heroism. With his sacrifice, Nuradilov stopped the powerful attack of the Germans, thereby giving time to regroup the Soviet troops, and did not allow the enemy to capture the Serafimovichi bridgehead, which gathered the main forces of our army for the main attack on the Wehrmacht group in Stalingrad.","popularity":0.1238,"poster_path":"/cDlC8PEIjHO9Rqs7wuK0oOGcjDl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dagger Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Height 220","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vysota 220","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2275786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuliya Makarova","original_name":"Юлия Макарова","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/s4ytFm8GC8W62emu8JBbsOWGbx0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Pelageya","credit_id":"5c9cbf58c3a368181d269e95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2223667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilya Antonenko","original_name":"Илья Антоненко","popularity":0.1548,"profile_path":"/mzuxreMjchAXhF0FIYNzdk4xWfX.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Sasha Sokolov","credit_id":"621b88397fcab3004187feb0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610656,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dmitry Domnin","original_name":"Dmitry Domnin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c56cb4cc3a36805e8840f96","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonid Plyaskin","original_name":"Leonid Plyaskin","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/ivPqrzO9XZrcRAHxAlqJ92EPImQ.jpg","credit_id":"5c56cac0c3a36826a6840ad0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shamil Dzhafarov","original_name":"Shamil Dzhafarov","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/yxoa6igNQExzLeYDToXmuwCjJyq.jpg","credit_id":"5c56cb2dc3a368478ca0719b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1974328,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrey Korobov","original_name":"Andrey Korobov","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c56cb3f9251415e3467615f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shamil Dzhafarov","original_name":"Shamil Dzhafarov","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/yxoa6igNQExzLeYDToXmuwCjJyq.jpg","credit_id":"5c56cb0792514116fc57dc2c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2179287,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eduard Galkin","original_name":"Эдуард Галкин","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/1EyoqvgmXrZ0ueo6PWpjzWk8tgE.jpg","credit_id":"5c56cb7ac3a3687290888772","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2021523,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grigoriy Rudakov","original_name":"Григорий Рудаков","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3nIFuVU4RTws6IsGm9da67McLoH.jpg","credit_id":"5c56cb58c3a368302884c5b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2297400,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrey Kostyuchenko","original_name":"Andrey Kostyuchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc323490e0a26105afaf54c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610650,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vadim Goryainov","original_name":"Vadim Goryainov","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/9W7sSsoKjNy2DQCnas1rLnxkZJA.jpg","credit_id":"5cc3238a0e0a261a55fb7e14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/cDlC8PEIjHO9Rqs7wuK0oOGcjDl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
