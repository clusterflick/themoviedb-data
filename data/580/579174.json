A population of several hundred creatures is created within a supercomputer, and each creature is tested for their ability to perform a given task, such the ability to swim in a simulated water environment. Those that are most successful survive, and their virtual genes containing coded instructions for their growth, are copied, combined, and mutated to make offspring for a new population. The new creatures are again tested, and some may be improvements on their parents. As this cycle of variation and selection continues, creatures with more and more successful behaviors can emerge.","popularity":0.3717,"poster_path":"/tGtcK90j6nzLu776yIn4sJ71E7P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evolved Virtual Creatures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3325264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Hansen","original_name":"Eric Hansen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61a07e8fd1332400905f5a8e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Sims","original_name":"Karl Sims","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c528b1dc3a368756485f79e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBTeyOWoJw0hJVtqNa0aNXaMJxz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tGtcK90j6nzLu776yIn4sJ71E7P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4563,"name":"virtual reality"},{"id":34152,"name":"evolution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Evolved Virtual Creatures (1994)","key":"RZtZia4ZkX8","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-12-16T19:01:21.000Z","id":"61a07c35ed28b90091eca3d7"}]}}}
