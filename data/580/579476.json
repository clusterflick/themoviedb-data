Christian plays Tommy, who reluctantly agrees to lead his band at a dance in a speakeasy where Lulu (Lucy Ames) may catch the attention of a Broadway producer. The club, however, is raided by the police and Tommy not only loses girlfriend Betty (Ruby) but finds himself expelled from college. Taking his band to Broadway, Tommy lands a spot in a high-class revue and is soon joined by a repentant Betty. The youngsters sneak away to get married while Jack Clark performs a furious tap dance.","popularity":0.1227,"poster_path":"/rCxq2VCAktkGGSyKadauPxlRb4K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rayart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howdy Broadway","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Christian","original_name":"Tommy Christian","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Orchestra Leader - Tommy Christian","credit_id":"5c545855c3a36847899ad9ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellalee Ruby","original_name":"Ellalee Ruby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"5c54586b9251415e34640d55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":567097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Kane","original_name":"Johnny Kane","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5458999251415e34640dbd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Mullen","original_name":"Diana Mullen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c54589dc3a36874b988db33","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Clark","original_name":"Jack Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"5c5458e8c3a36847779bd6f2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisy Dean","original_name":"Daisy Dean","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5458f10e0a263ccddf56b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Barnett","original_name":"Art Barnett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Art Barnett","credit_id":"5c5459059251410e0a654348","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Ames","original_name":"Lucy Ames","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Lulu","credit_id":"5c54590c92514154486001af","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Kieth","original_name":"Ted Kieth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5459180e0a265e19d0eb50","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Soltis","original_name":"Mona Soltis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5459210e0a26494dde1ed9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112514,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Parrish","original_name":"James Parrish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5459359251410e2465f18d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mart Britt","original_name":"Mart Britt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Banjo Player","credit_id":"5c545943c3a368729085476f","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1091306,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles J.
