Film strips— stained over days, weeks, and months with acrylic paint, ink, urine, termite droppings, etc.—are soaked in paint and saturated with time, resulting in a turbulent palimpsest with many layers and textures visible at once, each one moving with its own rhythm. There is an affective quality to the excesses of the imagery that is both repetitive and ecstatic, yet the overall experience is quiet and reflective.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rirpl36Lp9fCeGbhuvyFohY6VEa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Veils","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madison Brookshire","original_name":"Madison Brookshire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c57ed0ec3a368478ca29300","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rirpl36Lp9fCeGbhuvyFohY6VEa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
