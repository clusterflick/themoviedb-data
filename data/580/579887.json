A schizophrenic who lives in a psychiatric hospital near Namur, Moinet paints. After being mute for 24 years he chooses this cinematic encounter to explain his artist approach, revealing what lies behind his personal cosmogony. But this long logorrhoea proves disturbing and fails to provide possible clues to understanding his work, gradually becoming a form of music that blends in with the sounds and distant, invisible hubbub of the hospital. With Alessandro Ussai behind the camera and Roger Cambier responsible for the sound, Zéno gets up close to Moinet to better capture him in all his demiurgical excessiveness, his existence on the fringes but also his humanity, deconstructing in a series of very tight shots the man and his canvasses.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/hXjHPLvFKOPSonvw9wNd7LwdD1y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bouche sans fond ouverte sur les horizons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Moinet","original_name":"Georges Moinet","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c570f3492514135b04faa6d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Zéno","original_name":"Thierry Zéno","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/dl9jr7knZclMHEabm4f4c2bgURe.jpg","credit_id":"5c570f1b9251410e2469d618","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2429255,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Cambier","original_name":"Roger Cambier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9e5c09647654001f220379","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2429254,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alessandro Usai","original_name":"Alessandro Usai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9e5babf18ce7001d42aa38","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Zéno","original_name":"Thierry Zéno","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/dl9jr7knZclMHEabm4f4c2bgURe.jpg","credit_id":"5d9e5c69befd9100404052e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6996024","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hXjHPLvFKOPSonvw9wNd7LwdD1y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"No exact date specified","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
