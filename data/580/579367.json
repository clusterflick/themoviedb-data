Does Max despair? Never. The debonair gentleman sets his wits to work to frustrate his rival's little game, and though he meets with several rebuffs in the end he is successful. Even then the rival, on the eve of his wedding, tries to turn the tables on Max, and very nearly succeeds, but with the little lady's help Max finally wins. The story is full of quaint and whimsical humour, which culminates in some exceedingly funny scenes before a mirror, in which Max sees strange visions.","popularity":0.0824,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le duel de Max","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Max and His Rival","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Max","credit_id":"5c5374aa9251410e0a6453e1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","credit_id":"5c5374910e0a26495adeb5d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277682","wikidata_id":"Q3222477","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1913-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
