P.S. attempts to unravel the nuances of personality & character portrayal through the interaction of sound and image. As a couple engage in an argument, which carries on over the course of an evening, we watch a man, presumably the man speaking, working the land & going about his chores, smoking, walking through a forest and watching fireworks.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1onENYnpEHNHgntzISHA8XOozkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Wiand","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"P.S.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Salmon","original_name":"Margaret Salmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c543fb50e0a264965df7d15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4221092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":988,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1onENYnpEHNHgntzISHA8XOozkA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":659}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
