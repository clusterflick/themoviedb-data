They are the oldest living beings we come to know during our time on earth, living bridges into our planet’s expansive past. Treeline is a film celebrating the forests on which our species has always depended—and around which some skiers and snowboarders etch their entire lives. Follow a group of snow-seekers, scientists and healers as they explore the birch forests of Japan, the redcedars of British Columbia and the bristlecones of Nevada, delving deeper into the rich environments they call home.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/23GBgFb7WQHePeBoxjcJw14S3NP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148014,"logo_path":"/sh5M67BZcLtrMkyX6sXTcg4ci2z.png","name":"Patagonia","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treeline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2054124,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jordan Manley","original_name":"Jordan Manley","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c541018c3a36847899a93ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/taEnQYkJgGpxCYNpMRp5fIXnMlg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/23GBgFb7WQHePeBoxjcJw14S3NP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1167}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3522,"name":"snowboarding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Treeline (2019)","key":"YCEaYInJbos","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","published_at":"2019-01-27T15:57:42.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c54105fc3a36847779b8dbc"}]}}}
