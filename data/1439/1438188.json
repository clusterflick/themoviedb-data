Struggling to express herself, she finally gathers the courage to confront her boyfriend, Vinay. What starts as an honest conversation soon turns into a heated exchangeâ€”Vinay refuses to accept the breakup, shifting between denial, guilt, and anger. But just as Nivedita is about to walk away, she hesitates. Fear of change holds her back, and instead of ending things, she delays the inevitable. A raw and emotional take on love, self-worth, and the difficulty of letting go.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tylDYL9IPR8UB9s3URx7yg19Pki.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jam productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A relationship on the edge.
