The film reminds us of the architectural and historical significance of one of the most photographed homes in the City, designed by architect William Krisel for the family of renowned Palm Springs developer, Robert Alexander. Explored in the film are the decline of the house over the decades, its controversial fame as the Elvis Presley Honeymoon Hideaway, and its return to its original glory. Turned away by tragedy, Jill Alexander Kitnick returns to the house, recounting her childhood memories living there in the early 60s.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"palm springs mid century modern elvis presley honeymoon hideaway house of tomorrow","title":"Back to the House of Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27725172","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“Back to the House of Tomorrow” (V-Trailer)","key":"808908722","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-08T19:45:09.000Z","id":"67bb88e7741152b0420aad17"}]}}}
