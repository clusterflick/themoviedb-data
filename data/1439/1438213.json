Raphaël Pichon leads his acclaimed ensemble Pygmalion, whose impeccable musicianship and refreshingly original approach to early music have led them to the highest echelon of period-instrument outfits working today. Four magnificent solo voices—soprano Siobhan Stagg, alto Sara Mingardo, tenor Martin Mitterrutzner, and bass Luca Tittoto—blend seamlessly with the choir and orchestra in the most famous of all requiem masses, left unfinished by Mozart at his death.  \"Mozart's Requiem,\" writes musicologist Olivier Bellamy, \"is resolutely theatrical. From moment to moment, the music alternates between terror, joy, supplication, exaltation, and scriptural piety.\"","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/AtodRkaurXiGJCXj7N2fL9DY418.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart's Requiem - Festival d'Aix-en-Provence 2019","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1682083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siobhan Stagg","original_name":"Siobhan Stagg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/htiW1ZTOC6aulCv1WuAOOXaCls4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"67b9aabd06b5536bdc0a7691","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Mingardo","original_name":"Sara Mingardo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/nDMq9lElFy5qj3PcOaYU2BPQcUv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alto","credit_id":"67b9aad7b7c35459adbea3c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Mitterrutzner","original_name":"Martin Mitterrutzner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/w5HpXYXuYVWHv1BbMAfLNb66vgD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tenor","credit_id":"67b9aaf02edc9c13fb0a6ff9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Tittoto","original_name":"Luca Tittoto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"67b9ab072edc9c13fb0a700c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5262856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armelle Froeliger","original_name":"Armelle Froeliger","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"67b9ab28abeede36c4464f1b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chadi Lazreq","original_name":"Chadi Lazreq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Soprano child","credit_id":"67b9ab4206b5536bdc0a76c0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Castellucci","original_name":"Romeo Castellucci","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/1EDH1YiA5FS1JkPuD63s7qUOom5.jpg","credit_id":"67b9ab70abeede36c4464f28","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2157583,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raphaël Pichon","original_name":"Raphaël Pichon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b9ab8b9b0623e3b1beb212","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtodRkaurXiGJCXj7N2fL9DY418.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
