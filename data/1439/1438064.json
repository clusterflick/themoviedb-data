All of them have been in the media spotlight, and many have fallen victim to it due to their openness. How can a woman assert herself in a post-communist society? What opportunities do women have to succeed in politics within a traditionally patriarchal system?  Through the actions of these five protagonists, the hidden world of Estonian politics unfolds—both in its glamour and its horror.","popularity":0.1218,"poster_path":"/tb3iKtgnUT4uu7YnzI7V8SsDl8W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145495,"logo_path":null,"name":"In-Ruum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2000-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suur õde","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1954957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meelis Muhu","original_name":"Meelis Muhu","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/ybNbmt4FdghzzN3mrMczXw9ByDy.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f35b4a8721d16f491b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaak Kilmi","original_name":"Jaak Kilmi","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/nYfeVvTvfdqRCZVgup1Jc029VR0.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f419ce3986a4280988c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Maimik","original_name":"Andres Maimik","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pD1yb9hm7XhdGieAvebYsRP3JGp.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f57b4a8721d16f491bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Maimik","original_name":"Andres Maimik","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pD1yb9hm7XhdGieAvebYsRP3JGp.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f61030411c55cf3d0ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaak Kilmi","original_name":"Jaak Kilmi","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/nYfeVvTvfdqRCZVgup1Jc029VR0.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f6bda093929bd809b47","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510425,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Norkroos","original_name":"Erik Norkroos","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/juRhsX1ILWPwp6E8xDIyR8ptV0Y.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f7c9ce3986a428098a4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477887,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rasmus Nurk","original_name":"Rasmus Nurk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b90f89b4a8721d16f491e0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137560,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tiina Andreas","original_name":"Tiina Andreas","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/gFbrPELh2vCkEe1mQfudkx1iS37.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f95b4a8721d16f491e7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1337369,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kersti Miilen","original_name":"Kersti Miilen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/l6IITqRPtVVYdjxaL1VAowCRjsE.jpg","credit_id":"67b90f9fda093929bd809b60","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Maimik","original_name":"Andres Maimik","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pD1yb9hm7XhdGieAvebYsRP3JGp.jpg","credit_id":"67b90fa85eb94d29c2f3cd11","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tb3iKtgnUT4uu7YnzI7V8SsDl8W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PÖFF","release_date":"2000-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
