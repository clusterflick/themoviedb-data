Follow Andrew and his not-so-merry band of misfits as they race the clock to pull off one of the rowdiest \"house parties\" the New York art world has ever seen.  Originally screened at film festivals with a runtime of 43 minutes, this new, punchier 30-minute cut is the first time the general public has been able to view the film. It has been several years in the making.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/xlA6kDFOdwkNlpUUM3M7RpmU6if.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Bad Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728431,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Cannon","original_name":"Ben Cannon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bbba05abeede36c4468be3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412339,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brendan Swift","original_name":"Brendan Swift","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0cdd342c0ccc3ca1e05ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3873338","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlA6kDFOdwkNlpUUM3M7RpmU6if.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New Orleans Film Festival","release_date":"2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
