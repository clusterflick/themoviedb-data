Hailed as a masterpiece, the opera was triumphantly staged in cities around the world after its premiere in 1902. The dramatically effective narrative is a passionate love triangle filled with intrigue and complicated plot twists set in the gallant 18th century. Its subtle ironies and gorgeous cantabile style of music provide a perfect vehicle for the star cast in this stunning production from the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.","popularity":0.1385,"poster_path":"/iWIGHAzaYIsfdFBuZ2ccZ6NvA4w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77605,"logo_path":null,"name":"NAXOS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Teatro
