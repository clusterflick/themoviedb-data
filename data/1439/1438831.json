In 2018, the director attempted to shoot his first film, The Third Woman, in Cáceres, with his friend Amanda Toro as the main character. However, the project remained unfinished.  Years later, this experimental medium-length film returns to those images, confronting the filmed material with the distance of the present. What emerges is a reflection on cinema and memories, on cinema as trace and absence.","popularity":0.2051,"poster_path":"/iTwpoh3WB2d5TW7LKzbbDb1WimD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recuerdos
