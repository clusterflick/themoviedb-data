The outbreak of war meant that social and cultural norms were turned upside-down: women willingly stepped up to the essential war work, whilst also dealing with the heartbreak of evacuation, the terror and loss of the bombing raids of the Blitz, as well as the heavy burden of their menfolk being at war. Laughter and music, dates, dances and weddings plus the American GIs, helped the British people through the darkness. This indomitable spirit on the Home Front boosted troops' morale as they faced down the enemy bringing victory for the allies against all odds.","popularity":0.0943,"poster_path":"/rfRylI022pt7l3dcqU53uVPxMen.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler's Defeat: Victory Against All Odds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14902490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2310,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rfRylI022pt7l3dcqU53uVPxMen.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
