In her house on Providence Island, Florence performs her timeless gestures. In Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon, Simonne opens her house and heart to guests, friends, people without work. Mireille, Florence’s daughter, affirms her desire to keep living in Tête-à-la-Baleine despite the decline in fishing. Gédéon, an old fisherman, observes the universe through his fertile imagination. The passenger freighter, Nordik Express is the silent witness of the links woven by time in the immense territory of the lower North Shore of the St. Lawrence.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":"/rUmsv0MDbT55VSRGtqsDCMsHXSk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Tricycle","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avant le jour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Lambert","original_name":"Lucie Lambert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qHbkjtsuo9hAkduPLozq6khVIN6.jpg","credit_id":"67bb7ef3a96dc18979becfed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","original_name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9GHnEYPzSjWgohVRsbwEOSaLjGy.jpg","credit_id":"67bb7f08286bde3a090a6d90","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Giguère","original_name":"Serge Giguère","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7f1f33d749cc39bea59e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Roberge","original_name":"René Roberge","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7f2e06b5536bdc0abadd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103731,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diane Carrière","original_name":"Diane Carrière","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7f4106b5536bdc0abaed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073984,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yves Desrosiers","original_name":"Yves Desrosiers","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7f4f286bde3a090a6d97","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUmsv0MDbT55VSRGtqsDCMsHXSk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
