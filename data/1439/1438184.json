A small town in China, where everything feels stagnant. Middle school dropouts Cheng (14), Zhang(14), and Li(13), each burdened by their own troubles, hatch a plan to escape the town. Broke and desperate, they wander around the streets, looking for ways to \"make money.\" Eventually, they set out on a reckless robbery, and what begins as an ordinary day ends violently... The film follows them through this oppressive day, delving into the dark corners of adolescence.
