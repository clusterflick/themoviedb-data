Mrs. Kennedy has a vital link with the forest: Diane, faced with the difficult path of her life, raises her head; Cathy, at 18, has the biting lucidity of those who have had to fight. The strength and willpower of each of them is echoed by Guylaine, the young soprano who, throughout the film, plays, sings and exudes joie de vivre.","popularity":0.0502,"poster_path":"/fWU299qfL47ThhnXnUS7drh0d3a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Tricycle","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paysage sous les paupières","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Lambert","original_name":"Lucie Lambert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qHbkjtsuo9hAkduPLozq6khVIN6.jpg","credit_id":"67bb7afd33d749cc39bea496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","original_name":"Sylvain L'Espérance","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9GHnEYPzSjWgohVRsbwEOSaLjGy.jpg","credit_id":"67bb7b0d741152b0420aab52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Lambert","original_name":"Lucie Lambert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qHbkjtsuo9hAkduPLozq6khVIN6.jpg","credit_id":"67bb7b1c33d749cc39bea4ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Giguère","original_name":"Serge Giguère","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7b2cbf521f190f0a7af7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Beaugrand","original_name":"Claude Beaugrand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7b3bbf521f190f0a7b04","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194076,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Bertrand","original_name":"Pierre Bertrand","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7b4c33d749cc39bea4c6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Roberge","original_name":"René Roberge","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7b57abeede36c4467fbd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Auger","original_name":"Esther Auger","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7b6733d749cc39bea4d7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":872,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fWU299qfL47ThhnXnUS7drh0d3a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":584}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
