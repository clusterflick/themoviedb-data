The film is constructed around a formal central idea. The scenes are constructed to suggest a number of popular European directors of the period, but these styles morph into a free-for-all of film genres.  A quasi-personal voice over dovetails with minimum dialogue scenes. The film winds up being something of an essay, illustrating the major life choices and laid-back values of the hippie-era . The brief appearance of members of the Cockettes (the reigning company of drag queen camp at the time) and a cast happy to discard their clothes when asked adds to the general mayhem.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wsAN1pr2Z3pCotlXSdz0qh2jJjR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scene One: Take One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Harris","original_name":"Elizabeth Harris","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"67b9625d06b5536bdc0a6ab4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3355974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Cockettes","original_name":"The Cockettes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67b9626e55e3994bbd464bd3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronald Chase","original_name":"Ronald Chase","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/9OilRsZXeohZm8FyCpmNf3r5EIp.jpg","credit_id":"67b9624306b5536bdc0a6aab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1075,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wsAN1pr2Z3pCotlXSdz0qh2jJjR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SCENE ONE TAKE ONE 1 restored 2019 PRORES LT","key":"377914406","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-12-07T01:30:29.000Z","id":"67b9629d55e3994bbd464bda"}]}}}
