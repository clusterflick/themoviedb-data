Exploring themes of female friendship, suburbia and escapism, the aim is to celebrate these relationships and experiences as well as romanticising the idea of “the city”, as the emerald city is in the Wizard of Oz.  Using paper cut out and 3D collage to animate stop motion backgrounds, this is then combined with live action characters, the aim of this technique being to create an abstracted world based of the reality of the dreary suburban aesthetic combined with lively, illuminated cityscapes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yarjP8Mr6aurxOlXgmfwECsE1Cw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We're Not in Essex Anymore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5263372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grac Talbot","original_name":"Grac Talbot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ba062206b5536bdc0a8927","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855362,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ellen Beaufoy","original_name":"Ellen Beaufoy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ba0643b7c35459adbebb50","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162235,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ned Prevezer","original_name":"Ned Prevezer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ba06667219674c5a4663d3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5263376,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ella Mckiernan","original_name":"Ella Mckiernan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ba068e84e930a0210a7ddd","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.783,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8VtlGDYy32nmVsplobHhgQUXopX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yarjP8Mr6aurxOlXgmfwECsE1Cw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
