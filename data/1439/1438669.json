Marred by tears and sorrow, this love story reveals the destructive impact of feudal superstition on marital happiness, while standing up for the oppressed who suffer from the tyranny of the powerful few. Although the film concludes on a soothing note, the entire film is permeated with a heavy sense of sadness. The straightforwardness and courageous nature of Jin Feng is very much in line with the vividness and self-confidence of her real self. With her sparkling dark eyes and finely knitted braid, her innocent yet unyielding character attracted many admirers. The yet-to-be famous director King Hu plays the naïve little lad who has a crush on Jin Feng. His speech and expressions are all endearing, providing a lighthearted counterbalance to the film’s somber tone, and making him an extremely outstanding supporting character.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1956-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Phoenix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4409255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yan Jun","original_name":"Yan Jun","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/x7IvQkjh9S7Sagjd87qbu9c7VIH.jpg","credit_id":"67baffe3effeb96e9e0aa9b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Han-Hsiang","original_name":"Li Han-Hsiang","popularity":0.2137,"profile_path":"/eH70XyVqid9VroXRbgcnNjLebuc.jpg","credit_id":"67bafff0effeb96e9e0aa9bd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3811810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Li Zu-yong","original_name":"Li Zu-yong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9TguiC6ocPIUgJvxCNm8uD0lgQF.jpg","credit_id":"67bb000ed3631694664673ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2222644,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yao Min","original_name":"Yao Min","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oWJl9xMnBCLSffgwEOIXstCj21W.jpg","credit_id":"67bb0023d3631694664673f1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1956-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
