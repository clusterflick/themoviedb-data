The procession goes through the streets of a once prosperous town. Pueblo Rico celebrates the day of its patron saint, “Santa Rica.” The collective celebration serves as camouflage not only for a couple in love to sneak away to make love furtively, but also for the mayor to secretly introduce a load of toxic waste. The couple and the waste end up in the same hiding place: an old abandoned theater. This is how Ana and her boyfriend Froilán find out about the misdeeds of the mayor and his lover. In the midst of this situation, Froilán begins to irrigate his genitals with oil. The town believes that it is a miracle, turning Froilán into “The Irrigator,” a messenger of Santa Rica.","popularity":0.1232,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El irrigador","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Cuevas","original_name":"Antonio Cuevas","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67bb02da2492f40370464197","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalila Colombo","original_name":"Dalila Colombo","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67bb02ea2492f4037046419f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Cruz","original_name":"Carlos Cruz","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/oQ2xcqcs2LNcishAYhbQheaoSvc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67bb030ea23929ac28bed3d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Colmenares","original_name":"William Colmenares","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67bb0322741152b0420a9826","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
