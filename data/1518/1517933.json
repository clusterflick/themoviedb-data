DREAMS INSIDE AND OUT documents the history and development of the company.\r This documentary video, winner of the Silver Plaque Award at the Chicago International Film Festival, follows Pancho and Stanley while they produce STRAIGHT FROM THE GHETTO with a group of prisoners in Rikers Island Correctional Facility and DREAMS with former inmates. From their work, a unique method emerges that adapts to the institutional sponsor while drawing its material from the actor's life experiences. The plays blend scenes of jail and inner cities, personal aspirations and nightmares, with songs, creating an original music hall format.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2pyuk25HYvVfskhMKwoyxlM7W1G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams Inside and Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pyuk25HYvVfskhMKwoyxlM7W1G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
