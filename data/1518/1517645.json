While some feminist audiences of the film saw little of an affirmative model within it, WANDA also was exhibited in early women’s film festivals of the 1970-80s, where it was often programmed alongside the films here assembled. In a contemporaneous, parallel track of women’s filmmaking, women on the cusp of the feminist movement’s second wave began to analyze the problems they faced in their daily lives. Across non-fiction and avant-garde modes, these films embodied an emergent collective feminist voice using distinct strategies: collage, disruption, self-narration.
