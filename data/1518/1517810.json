Kishanji readily agrees to punish Chitrasen by beheading him with the Sudarshan Chakra. When no amount of pleas for mercy are adhered to, a compassionate Subhadra, moved by Chitrangini's plight, asks her spouse, Arjun, to intervene. The later, at first, refuses to take up arms against Kishanji, his friend, but subsequently relents - resulting in war - that will not only end their friendship - but may well also destroy the universe and annihilate Arjun, his brothers and their entire army.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6P3yRnnA5PHvKktbejWO55hgsBO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Murari
