To reflect on his uncertain future, he decides to take a solo vacation to Corsica. Under the scorching summer sun, the introverted young man meets Léana and Félix, with whom he shares a shabby room in a youth hostel. The duo welcomes him warmly, as if they were old friends, which unsettles Nathan. Initially distant, he gradually grows fond of the pair, who are the complete opposite of him. Little by little, an unexpected bond forms between them—one that deeply shakes him.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/oJs4PObpZrlorBxvOs8g8H8Do0A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corsimar Films
