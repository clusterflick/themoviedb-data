It was almost pre-ordained for him to follow in his parent’s footsteps…  Working with groups around the south coast of England finally resulted in Keff joining Pickity Witch and later The Climax Blues Band and a successful career as a musician.  So how did this lead to writing the updated theme music for Doctor Who and incidental music for stories in all three Sylvester McCoy seasons?  All this and much more is revealed in this latest Myth Makers hosted by Nicholas Briggs and shot on location in Australia and the UK.  In a frank and honest interview, Keff discusses the criticism levelled at him by some fans and shows the humour that carried him through the incredibly pressurised work schedule set him by the Doctor Who production office.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ssWX5FNe2ou6oBVHijo8haATJOC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 57: Keff McCulloch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230730,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keff McCulloch","original_name":"Keff McCulloch","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/bcxerFHxXjy3L20XNteoC3tcsXz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68802267fbcc2b691738e3d1","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ssWX5FNe2ou6oBVHijo8haATJOC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
