As she prepares for the moment when she will be lifted off the ground, her encounter with Ginevra fractures the surface of childhood and opens a crack from which a new and unsettling desire seeps in. In a suspended time and place, the film covers the imperceptible yet radical transition between imposed purity and awareness of one’s own body, between childhood and adulthood. A female coming-of-age tale that investigates — through its hagiographic and apocryphal aesthetic — the symbolic construct of grace and the inherited weight of guilt.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sante","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valeria Gaudieri","original_name":"Valeria Gaudieri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68801f61e4afd09aec72d4fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
