His strong masculine presence, which resonated so much with audiences in the 1960s and ’70s, combined with his box office success, cemented his status as one of the biggest stars in Hollywood history.  Whether it was his iconic roles in movies like 1963’s “The Great Escape,” where he played a persistent escapee, or his character as the wrongly convicted prisoner in 1973’s “Papillon” to his role as a no-nonsense detective investigating the murder of a witness in 1968’s “Bullitt,” McQueen was frequently cast as a risk taker who let his actions speak louder than his words.  McQueen often played characters who were tough, independent, and sometimes rebellious, which was a departure from more traditional leading men. His roles reflected the anti-hero themes of the time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Throttle: The Steve McQueen Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
