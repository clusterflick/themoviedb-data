Not only because it was marred by doping scandals, but also because it reached new heights in sporting terms. The Deux Alpes stage and the rise to power of Marco Pantani, the winged climber, will remain one of the greatest moments in the sport. Impressive in his victory in 1997, Jan Ullrich went on to show admirable spirit in defeat by winning two more stages. This passing of the torch between two great champions made the 1998 Tour so memorable and provided us with some exceptional images.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Tour de France 1998","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2436625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Pantani","original_name":"Marco Pantani","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/clvUHaSoIENRtquFSlg3vNbxKvB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"687fc9fd22c579e4f038e26a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Zabel","original_name":"Erik Zabel","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/bIhcdbSqQNbVJr6q3T7vvRU417f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"687fca062bdd11277a2450a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2310641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Ullrich","original_name":"Jan Ullrich","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/7EcdD8hNAwYoZz0YpxAOxLjooh8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"687fca137e0188d5cb72d2fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2593145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Chêne","original_name":"Patrick Chêne","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":"/oJ0vqNYrU1YRZZOitnriYEPFMdZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"687fca2c1b63a0b008d996cb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Bade","original_name":"Bruno Bade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687fca45a33cb327a372d3f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Bade","original_name":"Bruno Bade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687fca5eac0991943b16ab62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1998-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
