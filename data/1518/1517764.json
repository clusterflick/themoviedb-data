When the Smarmies (sick creatures bent on smothering the world with good will & love) blew up Cynot 3 in a supernova, Art, Jo, & Dave escape only to crash land on a strange world called Earth. With supercomputer/babysitter Pal 4000 at the helm of the spacevan, the guys learn valuable lessons about the Heimlich maneuver, lip sync-ing and making sure their spacevan is powered with plenty of rock & roll. Of course the smarmies are never far behind, as they won't rest until every last Cynotian has been loved to death.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/fzabuf5t1czw0YPvj3GuWG1oVXV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amphetamine Reptile
