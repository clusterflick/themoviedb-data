The video portrays scenes of daily life in Gaza through the lens of a disrupted communication between two friends, Diaa and Mohannad. Diaa requests filmmaker Mohannad to use his phone to capture raw visual materials during his displacement journey from Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah since October. Mohammad’s compliance cements a bond forged during their student days and addresses the phenomenon of data clouding and transferring through alternative channels like Telegram. Using the chat window as a visual element to evoke a sense of our modern anxiety and the relentless pace induced by ADHD, the footage is received and processed by Diaa.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gow97znELFVd8yVwVgCGvDADuCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2024-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"gaza.mp4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diaa Lagan","original_name":"Diaa Lagan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6880b4aee242da0f0f55da0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5581609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohhand El-Masri","original_name":"Mohhand El-Masri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6880b4d9aaded2ad66529a12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fuad Halwani","original_name":"Fuad Halwani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6880b4e5a684bf0e3872d69a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gow97znELFVd8yVwVgCGvDADuCy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dissolutions film festival, Dublin, Ireland 2024","release_date":"2024-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
