Located between Bielefeld, Detmold, and Paderborn, the Senne is home to rare insects and birds, endangered amphibians, and large herds of fallow deer. Nowhere else in North Rhine-Westphalia are there so many sand lizards. The fact that this natural paradise is known to few is due to its unique history: For 130 years, large sections of the Senne have served as a military training area. Entry to the area is strictly prohibited for civilians.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2QGJvC2JKBXK4Qmu9jdo33iz6f4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Räuber in Westfalen - Neues Leben in Panzerspuren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Räuber in Westfalen: Neues Leben in Panzerspuren","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La vie sauvage à l'ombre des blindés","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2773630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heike Grebe","original_name":"Heike Grebe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687fff701733da38d2529982","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2773630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heike Grebe","original_name":"Heike Grebe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687fff77be0fabb0b238e3eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16385706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/kPCJ0lRtP2KsUXIA0R3f108bDuK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldfvuTQ9TqaHa4ncqdGPCODgBBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2QGJvC2JKBXK4Qmu9jdo33iz6f4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2020-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
