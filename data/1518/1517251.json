The audience is taken on a journey unfolding in four chapters. A relationship driven by wild excitement, to loss which breaks the spirit, evoking a desperate need to regain control but leading to destruction and inevitable death.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ykfblNZE0rrDyW9D7Ob41xmaLzq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey Through the Passion and Tragedy in Four of Shakespeare's Peerless Pairings","title":"If It Be Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Bird","original_name":"Alice Bird","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/3wEUwWNO3m1MNu7RFrVeliCnZl5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cleopatra, Hamlet, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth","credit_id":"687fbd5cc628188ef1f77420","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2799974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinta Morgan","original_name":"Vinta Morgan","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Antony, Macbeth, Othello","credit_id":"687fbd822b930fb6d5529545","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5580040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neve Faulkner","original_name":"Neve Faulkner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Emilia","credit_id":"687fbdb9bf9903a48bf77274","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5580041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Burrows","original_name":"Philip Burrows","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Prison Warden","credit_id":"687fbdca920ecaf29f244fa5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5580042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Kaliszewski","original_name":"Desmond Kaliszewski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Skipper","credit_id":"687fbdd950915a744e2450bb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5580043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Scott","original_name":"Chris Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Messenger","credit_id":"687fbdf823e3f6d09038e171","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792567,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Filip L.
