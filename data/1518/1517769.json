Inspired by environmentalist Jonathon Porritt's predictions for the next five years, we meet a young grower and chef, a determined Norfolk activist, an Indian Tik-Tok influencer, an outspoken politician and a innovative documentary maker. Each character emerges out of the chaos of 2020 and discovers their own unique role in creating a better future. This film is a hope-filled call to action for anyone who believes we have a collective and individual power to make a real difference in the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2XjxBHhDckKr5bIYuxQJeLUeKbc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank & Lively","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Will You Reboot The Future?","title":"Rise Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Cater","original_name":"Emma Cater","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/mLUsC1Kq08zfRIRa9284Laq7kev.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Allison","credit_id":"6881101f807abd7583d99d2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5582204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Gutierrez","original_name":"Jon Gutierrez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tyler","credit_id":"6881104c6a3804c20e16af6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3554544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priya Kansara","original_name":"Priya Kansara","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/zv9kpaQ8AVBfjI2LAAZV58NeVQg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lahari","credit_id":"6881105a809b249fc6245529","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2860849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shem Hamilton","original_name":"Shem Hamilton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/5Et6oO25QkHehLpNgizZ2N4FdXK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jamal","credit_id":"68811067b357b167298a58a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3518338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frewyn Thursfield","original_name":"Frewyn Thursfield","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jay","credit_id":"68811072f9fcc95b9ad99dd7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5582205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Venice van Someren","original_name":"Venice van Someren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Erin","credit_id":"68811082b45b3fa48516afe3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4176547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Jane Austin","original_name":"Sophie Jane Austin","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68811000096e0ed3fb72da46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5582202,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Beth Flintoff","original_name":"Beth Flintoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6881100e8b3b81d37124568b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16528880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2XjxBHhDckKr5bIYuxQJeLUeKbc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
