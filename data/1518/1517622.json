This is the story recounted in a 1999 documentary by Alexis Bernier and Philippe Lévy, with contributions from some of the movement's leading figures. Through archive footage, club scenes and interviews, this film tells the story of a genre that has resonated far beyond French borders, traveling from New York to London before returning to France with the name French touch. The style is defined by its funky sounds, its distinctive basslines and a positive, feel-good spirit, often with a touch of humor.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The French Touch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2989209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Bernier","original_name":"Alexis Bernier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6880ad8990c737dad716ade8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1376250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Lévy","original_name":"Philippe Lévy","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/9mgv88CuCOYl0v7itW7hcLlhZRF.jpg","credit_id":"6880adb70213a4f73538e759","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
