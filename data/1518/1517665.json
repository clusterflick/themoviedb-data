From membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts to friendship with Steven Spielberg, his enviable career has been covered in numerous newspaper articles in Croatia. When he reveals to his students that he is battling leukemia, they spread the humanitarian campaign for his treatment to the public. As the line between film and reality blurs, traces of a collective and willing silence, which upheld for decades this character of the beloved professor, gradually come to light.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is the World's Best Film Professor.
