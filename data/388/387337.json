Mykola knows everything, because of what her grandpa told her: it's not good to lie; a guy has to be led over the water so that he was forever faithful; a movie in the sky is more interesting than a movie in the cinema; and a human life is like the flight of a golden fly over the fire – similarly bright and similarly short.","popularity":0.185,"poster_path":"/8hYOZ2sxnUq2ZvlCxbxM3TGMkpT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trembita-Kino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
