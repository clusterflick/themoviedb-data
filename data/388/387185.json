Tom learns that the prison odor clings by being ceremoniously turned away wherever he applies for work. Slim Jim immediately on his release beats his way west. Eventually Tom goes west and finds his work. Several months later Slim Jim gets a job at the same place Tom is employed. Slim Jim, being caught at his old tricks and exposed by Tom, reveals Tom's past. The several thrilling scenes that follow show Tom's genuine manhood and gives Slim Jim an opportunity to prove that even the underdog has at least a spark of good lying dormant under the rough exterior.","popularity":0.2203,"poster_path":"/4XdyBvaeM6n627iIBxcM7UMWUGN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slim Jim's Last Chance","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlyle Blackwell","original_name":"Carlyle Blackwell","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/rVXhwWrYMW1bwxobOAP0ZXG1Zby.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Slim Jim aka Red Davis","credit_id":"56e41fd29251416d46003102","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1126366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Joyce","original_name":"Alice Joyce","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":"/kwMrZqYXmnOmorAbL0nWhTQykjP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Rancher's Daughter","credit_id":"56e41fe6c3a3685a900035cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Melford","original_name":"George Melford","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/aV70vLKnT7p3mVk1CehvMIXq7T1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Benton","credit_id":"56e41ff5c3a3685aa00033bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.P.
