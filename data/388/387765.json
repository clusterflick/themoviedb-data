This breezy story based on an comedy unreleased in Italy at that time is built around Ruggeri, who plays the role of a playboy father who wants to turn into the family delights rejoining his son until then neglected. Novelli, a little uncomfortable in a role that would have required ten years less, is the good-hearted rustic son. Pina Menichelli, adorned with flowers, wanders about on her bicycle, between not only two men, but also two lifestyles. In this role, she shows off a naturalness that will surprise people who know her only for her decadent performances. Sometimes, though, a dark glimpse reveals the character of the actress, that will stand out in the imagination of the public.","popularity":0.1751,"poster_path":"/lGk8UlHJOiaY9T8jUHsHPXiNfae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Italiana Cines","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1915-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papà","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Menichelli","original_name":"Pina Menichelli","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/lKzds3ubxoJPxO8fJeRBuCG0rYs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7b094c3a3684082001d0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amleto Novelli","original_name":"Amleto Novelli","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/2lnpfqjR2W6FyZJ7JwZzT5uGyJc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7b09d9251410917001a00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Piemontesi","original_name":"Giuseppe Piemontesi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7b0ac92514109d20001d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzy Prim","original_name":"Suzy Prim","popularity":0.2775,"profile_path":"/49H6995QQomKqYEzZFida5XIxMC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7b0be92514109d20001d8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruggero Ruggeri","original_name":"Ruggero Ruggeri","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8Soia6hf81RMai1l8PyZojHKRYl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7b0c7c3a368409d001b52","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amerigo Tramonti","original_name":"Amerigo Tramonti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7b0d09251410a3a00020f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert de Flers","original_name":"Robert de Flers","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617d7bd1bc2cb3002bafa2b4","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1756275,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gaston Arman de Caillavet","original_name":"Gaston Arman de Caillavet","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617d7bda0d5d85002afc41b0","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nino Oxilia","original_name":"Nino Oxilia","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/sAOSbxu5ptQyZkz2SFg2qfKd6ro.jpg","credit_id":"56e7b040925141757f000499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0963324","wikidata_id":"Q3894918","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lGk8UlHJOiaY9T8jUHsHPXiNfae.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1498,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62q0T5J5qScKMoDKHDyfnT33SHJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1076},{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":1502,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w9mUoyUZSPa1T1JcgDLNQgKzUO4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1032}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
