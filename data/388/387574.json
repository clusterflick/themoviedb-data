However, through decades of political and educational vilification of their counterparts by the KMT and CCP, and despite close economic and cultural ties, what lies beneath the diplomatic relations is a disconnect and mistrust that cannot be denied. KE is a failed business in Taiwan who hopes to start over as a 'Taiwanese Expat' in Shenzheng, China with a Taiwanese company. Lili, a laborer from China, meets her Taiwanese husband online and moves to Taiwan in hopes of a better life. Both KE and Lili cross the straits in hope of achieving what they cannot find in their homeland. But how much do they really know about that country across the straits?","popularity":0.4503,"poster_path":"/ocAsBgUUiYoFXXlVBDczabWH6kg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20532,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNEX Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464590,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Tsiang","original_name":"Ben Tsiang","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qNUK6xEflI6fR7z3MgzFItOzNeh.jpg","credit_id":"56e680f59251417ea2000166","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1961109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsai Tsung-lung","original_name":"Tsai Tsung-lung","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/3KxoIGxpg2eUMMZH6xpFIr54b2D.jpg","credit_id":"56e680aa9251416d46009213","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1961109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsai Tsung-lung","original_name":"Tsai Tsung-lung","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/3KxoIGxpg2eUMMZH6xpFIr54b2D.jpg","credit_id":"56e683d492514143f3000987","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3058792","wikidata_id":"Q7755524","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ocAsBgUUiYoFXXlVBDczabWH6kg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9322,"name":"taiwan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
