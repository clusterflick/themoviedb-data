Born to a white American soldier and a black Trinidadian woman, she is exposed to death at an early age, being conceived and growing up near a cemetery, and miraculously surviving after accidentally ingesting poison. At age eighteen, she dreams a premonition of the future, after which she realizes that she is the \"Messiah\". Her presence on Earth will herald an event known as the \"Apocalypso\" - the end of humanity.","popularity":0.2568,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caribbeing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TT","name":"Trinidad and Tobago"}],"release_date":"2006-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SistaGod","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1589531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Cherrie","original_name":"Michael Cherrie","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Father Divine","credit_id":"56e414c6c3a3685a9a002f29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Caesar-Munroe","original_name":"Evelyn Caesar-Munroe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56e414d4c3a3685a9e003193","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yashmin Campagne","original_name":"Yashmin Campagne","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56e414dbc3a3685a9e003199","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew McHugh","original_name":"Matthew McHugh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56e414e89251415b5f001f7a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indigo Minerve","original_name":"Indigo Minerve","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56e414ee92514109d8001a8d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Minerve","original_name":"Nicole Minerve","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"56e414f5c3a3685a9a002f33","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yao Ramesar","original_name":"Yao Ramesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e4144b9251416d46002ed2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yao Ramesar","original_name":"Yao Ramesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e414519251416d46002ed6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yao Ramesar","original_name":"Yao Ramesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e4151092514115ec0008e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0847093","wikidata_id":"Q7530991","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156030,"name":"trinidad"},{"id":167861,"name":"caribbean sea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
