It is a wordless play, the only sound that of a male voice humming, then singing, from the last seven bars of Schubert’s lied Nacht und Träume, words by Matthäus Casimir von Collin: \"Holde Träume, kehret wieder!\" (\"Sweet dreams, come back\"). Schubert was a composer much loved by Beckett – \"the composer who spoke most to him…whom he considered a friend in suffering\" (Wiki)  Beckett lists five elements that make up the play: evening light, the dreamer (A), his dreamt self (B), a pair of dreamt hands and the last seven bars of Schubert’s lied.","popularity":0.4178,"poster_path":"/e3kIL1I3yYaUSscPftV8dvS1rm2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night and Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helfrid Foron","original_name":"Helfrid Foron","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57148f1f9251412d7200086f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Morgner","original_name":"Dirk Morgner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57148f2bc3a3685370011330","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Pritz","original_name":"Stephan Pritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57148f3792514105a8001f48","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148609,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Samuel Beckett","original_name":"Samuel Beckett","popularity":0.4117,"profile_path":"/e1SlVssYS2O6Xq35u89ZKHPKEgt.jpg","credit_id":"56e4a8299251411fef00009b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607309,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jim Lewis","original_name":"Jim Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57148f0dc3a368412200f576","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148609,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Samuel Beckett","original_name":"Samuel Beckett","popularity":0.4117,"profile_path":"/e1SlVssYS2O6Xq35u89ZKHPKEgt.jpg","credit_id":"57148f029251415227000272","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234306","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1206,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGPzzssmsXCalOYeXcy8lRTmlTh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":803},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e3kIL1I3yYaUSscPftV8dvS1rm2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
