The band appeared alongside such acts as Deep Purple, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Rare Earth, Seals & Crofts and The Eagles  It was originally broadcast on ABC’s ‘Wide World in Concert’ series, which aired three songs from Sabbath on May 24th, 1974 – and later rebroadcast this segment in November ’74.  This footage has never been commercially available, aside from one clip of “Children of The Grave”.  The entire show was recorded as a soundboard audio, but apparently only these four songs were captured on video.
