The British soldiers were the last of the Great War volunteers, who joined up together to fight the Germans. They knew that there was a strong chance they would die in France, but to die in Dublin would never have crossed their minds. The Irish Volunteers were weekend warriors many of whom had no idea they were about to take part in large scale battles on the streets of Dublin.","popularity":0.6251,"poster_path":"/yQXbmuTH05mhx7UOEROKqYvBVdI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72078,"logo_path":"/yRikfpa6bTBv4mccdgb0RRv8LjB.png","name":"Tile Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Terrible Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh O'Conor","original_name":"Hugh O'Conor","popularity":0.2268,"profile_path":"/2eXLWxV2DGGtAPzpbDZ0eHv9RrO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lt.
