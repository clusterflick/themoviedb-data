The inspired teachers’ ultimate challenge is to offer these children a safe haven and make their school days as ordinary as possible. At first glance, De Verrekijker looks like a normal Dutch primary school. However, the boys and girls are children of rejected asylum seekers. Headmaster Toon and the teachers do all they can to give them the best education. Yet each morning they worry if any pupil has been forced to leave the country. After a series of deportations it becomes increasingly difficult to provide the children with a safe haven. The situation escalates when a group of Syrian boys fleeing war arrive at the school.","popularity":0.1847,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":70226,"logo_path":null,"name":"CTM Docs","origin_country":""},{"id":74249,"logo_path":null,"name":"ThankEve","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It takes devotion to teach kids facing deportation","title":"Forget Me Not","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1590974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Jaap Kuiper","original_name":"Jan Jaap Kuiper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e6caf792514103c5006697","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550560,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosan Boersma","original_name":"Rosan Boersma","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e6cb1ec3a3685a9a009e6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033138,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas den Drijver","original_name":"Thomas den Drijver","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e6cb2d9251412c4c001746","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sander Verdonk","original_name":"Sander Verdonk","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e6cb399251417ea2000d06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590975,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Wijbenga","original_name":"Tim Wijbenga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e6cb06c3a3685aa000a85a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5512456","wikidata_id":"Q24686062","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
