The regular pulses of light framing the looser rhythmus of the spoon, itself a frame. A charging of each of the frame's edges with its own particular energy.

The pulses of vision, the simple natural processes, lift the spirit.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":"/37EfEKecgJnefvcqfHh8e54pwkA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blues","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Gottheim","original_name":"Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y6YJWdMk6006kMVK1CwZXWtD713.jpg","credit_id":"56e7bc72c3a3684099001acb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3957150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/37EfEKecgJnefvcqfHh8e54pwkA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fL7ZCThgOUpCDMW3NyMB9xwaU87.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
