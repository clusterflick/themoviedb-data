What started as a small video project and have grown into a team of racers, a line of bikes produced with Cinelli, and an outlet for friends to support each other through bikes. The accompanying video takes a narrower view than the book, focusing primarily on street-riding in San Francisco. With exceptional riding and up-close cinematography, the video captures the joy of riding track bikes in a city like SF and passes that excitement along.","popularity":0.2949,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mash Transit Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mash SF","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":582,"name":"san francisco, california"},{"id":154948,"name":"fixed gear bike"},{"id":179103,"name":"fixed"},{"id":179104,"name":"fixie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
