Marcelo was left behind in Cuba burdened with the heavy duty of caring for his grandfather who was in poor health. Distance wasn’t the only issue that marked the separation of the two brothers; their mother couldn’t endure the rough trip and she died before the boat could reach its destination. More than twenty years later, Carlos Quevedo decides to return to Cuba to see his brother only to find that he is now stricken with ALS, a terminal disease that slowly immobilizes him to the point of a vegetative state.","popularity":0.2343,"poster_path":"/zJm7EQq1jX2ENTMkxoXmNPHVEdh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habana Instant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Márquez","original_name":"Christopher Márquez","popularity":0.164,"profile_path":"/w1UoPOEjAJ5NSLZNztI70PIpkrG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56e8da9a92514101ee0006ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Iván","original_name":"Guillermo Iván","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/zH8BOepVqv3l1uQvHfRyPSX65OJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56e8daaac3a3682d72001b1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1591607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zair Montes","original_name":"Zair Montes","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/xWvNGI1121rNw2wrq9aOkWGQol1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56e8dab792514154d7001201","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1568256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abril Schreiber","original_name":"Abril Schreiber","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/il2OCtyMcqvo7DqVSCeIaUFFpQm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56e8dac0c3a3682d72001b25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sixto Esteban","original_name":"Sixto Esteban","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56e8dac8c3a3682d5d001d13","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Luis De Cabo","original_name":"Jorge Luis De Cabo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"56e8dad19251417a86000854","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Labarta","original_name":"Michel Labarta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"56e8dada9251417a8600085c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Iván","original_name":"Guillermo Iván","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/zH8BOepVqv3l1uQvHfRyPSX65OJ.jpg","credit_id":"56e8da719251417a8600083a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Iván","original_name":"Guillermo Iván","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/zH8BOepVqv3l1uQvHfRyPSX65OJ.jpg","credit_id":"56e8da80c3a3682d69001a6c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4026586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2qqWdNF0pP5FxRULdjpYWBYg0Be.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zJm7EQq1jX2ENTMkxoXmNPHVEdh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Habana Instant (2015) | Trailer | Pedro Calvo, Jorge Luis de Cabo, Guillermo Iván","key":"QaNWCC7jKQU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-11-30T22:50:11.000Z","id":"61f416e99a3c49001bdbe580"}]}}}
