Fitzpatrick's Traveltalk series, takes the viewer to the capital of British India, Delhi. Visits to mosques and temples are followed by a tour of the shopping district, Chandni Chowk. The streets are filled bullock carts and only a few cars. Much is made of the peaceful co-existence between Hindu and Muslim. This is followed by a visit to the Viceroy's palace in adjoining New Delhi with a taste of the pomp and majesty of Imperial India.","popularity":0.085,"poster_path":"/qJOkKw3jquQrKxjp2iyYJMeMJiL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imperial Delhi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James A.
