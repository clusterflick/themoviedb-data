The biggest project of its type in the history of Calgary, Wreck City invited over 150 artists to participate. Operating on good faith, a shoestring budget, and naive energy, a curatorial collective facilitated the project, negotiated by-law, police complaints, graffiti, and accusations of aiding and abetting gentrification.  Created in a month and open to the public for just over a week, artists crafted accessible works of public art dealing with a vast number of issues and themes, including gentrification, community, and the institutionalized art world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WRECK CITY: AN EPILOGUE FOR 809","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
