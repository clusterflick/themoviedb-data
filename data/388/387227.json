They build new instruments and work with quotidian noises. In the process, the ostensible noise often becomes sound. An adventurous journey of discovery into the realm of noises and sounds, rhythms and stillness. Together with people who listen closely and without reservation. A film that aims to engage viewers to listen with their eyes and see with their ears. Astonishingly sublime.","popularity":0.2989,"poster_path":"/dWZ4TuEUGiVRNKx213Ehd9LKrp4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirapix
