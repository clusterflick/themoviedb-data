In truth, Max is fictitious – born out of the fantasy of the filmmaker Clemens Klopfenstein, who created him as his alter ego. Max falls in love with the impassioned Christine, but she jilts him within a short time because of his reluctant disposition. He thus takes a decision: to call upon the “master” in the hopes that he can liberate him from the interminably same role. Based on works by Clemens Klopfenstein, the compilation film emerges as a new, self-contained story, while rendering palpable the very essence of the filmmaker.","popularity":0.0548,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A hipster-art compilation movie made out of a bunch of Klopfenstein Films.","title":"The Master and Max","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345711,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcel Derek Ramsay","original_name":"Marcel Derek Ramsay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cd292209dda4007a6cea07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4721410","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurn Film Festival","release_date":"2015-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
