Marie-Madeleine (Sylvie Drapeau) is a photographer in her mid-30s who, for the first time, has come into contact with Mado (France Arbour), her biological mother, who put her up for adoption shortly after she was born. Marie-Madeleine is to take a long road trip for a magazine assignment, and she invites Mado along. Joining the two women is Marie-Madeleine's daughter (Isadora Galwey), who has yet to meet her German father. The three women share their thoughts and ideas as they travel through an idyllic setting to photograph birds. Les Fantomes des Trois Madeleine was shown at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors Fortnight series.","popularity":0.4216,"poster_path":"/dBrtgyT7YTnIXsGpdfpd6IaiCxD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Main Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Madeleines","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Drapeau","original_name":"Sylvie Drapeau","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/hgWKkyv0LKxcgaTOXRggwO2YlD1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7235192514103c5007264","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1297906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"France Arbour","original_name":"France Arbour","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/AuRmfE3LYVsfUpqaBrgbI0g7hmU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7235cc3a3685a9e00b579","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isadora Galwey","original_name":"Isadora Galwey","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56e72362925141372400048e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1096279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Fortin","original_name":"Kathleen Fortin","popularity":0.1916,"profile_path":"/hPNoLCN5idro5JiEVvhuubmzP48.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7237992514136aa00048f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Gaudette","original_name":"Maxim Gaudette","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/iGFDGJmGUxLOSIamTENFDecJdkA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7238092514136f800044f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Blais","original_name":"Isabelle Blais","popularity":0.1906,"profile_path":"/mHAGtfceogfaktpMkiLOuYMoS61.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7239492514165250069b2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Joly","original_name":"Monique Joly","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/gXtEppE5vmY5HGu6UjNtdAnji9J.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"56e7239b92514103c500726f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":979961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Proulx","original_name":"Luc Proulx","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/zM02LBHAWJlzG9T8jxEJu6bgRI7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"56e723b392514165250069b9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Guy Bouchard","original_name":"Jean-Guy Bouchard","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":"/mOlgYf42fMNVgZF6nWl8d6lIgOg.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"56e723bac3a3685aa400ac2f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Goyette","original_name":"Patrick Goyette","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/gZz5G07JmJ1s8APr7oeIoZMnY4j.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"56e723c692514103c5007277","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guylaine Dionne","original_name":"Guylaine Dionne","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/de3MsdK3Ehaaek3Q9OZ5poQivnt.jpg","credit_id":"56e7233292514136f800043d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0188613","wikidata_id":"Q55238632","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dBrtgyT7YTnIXsGpdfpd6IaiCxD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"Quinzaine des Réalisateurs Cannes","release_date":"2000-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les Fantômes des trois Madeleine (version restaurée) - Bande annonce","key":"392065109","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-17T20:25:10.000Z","id":"6394232a2cefc20084b44524"}]}}}
