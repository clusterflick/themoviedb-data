Fernando Birri made a film from this work in 1959, using the original text of the German explorer Ulrich Schmidel.  This film, which disappeared in the years of the dictatorship, was miraculously restored on video in 2000.  The story that the documentary describes can be compared with the situation of Latin American cinema throughout all these years.","popularity":0.075,"poster_path":"/zuRcb87gAtkkfrEFD510q5BJ6cL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Foundation of Buenos Aires","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Birri","original_name":"Fernando Birri","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/tgatCbyRLh4s96XCmsUEo8rhSRp.jpg","credit_id":"56e974079251417bb700375b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0053190","wikidata_id":"Q17462613","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zuRcb87gAtkkfrEFD510q5BJ6cL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
