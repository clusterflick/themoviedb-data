As the childless pair humorously adjust to their new surroundings, they soon spend more time concentrating on conceiving than in searching for the talented canine. The subdued, reflective Land of the Singing Dog was screened as part of the Director's Fortnight at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.","popularity":0.1293,"poster_path":"/8hrKNiPMmhV2wVL6bwV8rXNlK20.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of the Singing Dog","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":582023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katsuko Nakamura","original_name":"Katsuko Nakamura","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/junft28SHDsdc75WVx2dZM4NzQk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yoshiko Mahiru","credit_id":"5ec965d90fb17f001c7c0f44","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gen Shimaoka","original_name":"Gen Shimaoka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4beLuymUu8lbHQdzsFeSVCYUqhn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec965dfe635710021cdee4f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jules Dedet-Granel","original_name":"Jules Dedet-Granel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec965e4eb79c20020a235c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Piard","original_name":"Dominique Piard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec965ebd2147c0021b7f1a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Piard","original_name":"François Piard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec965f1eb79c2001ea28bc4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6318,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yann Dedet","original_name":"Yann Dedet","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/dHjtZWjbrPc0wbav8cD431sUq4O.jpg","credit_id":"56e70babc3a3685aa000b123","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6318,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yann Dedet","original_name":"Yann Dedet","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/dHjtZWjbrPc0wbav8cD431sUq4O.jpg","credit_id":"5ec965a3140bad001d1da826","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170556,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stéphane Bouquet","original_name":"Stéphane Bouquet","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":"/25fwz6eBS5VAsCAgQItmqSgXyCr.jpg","credit_id":"5ec965ac7f1d830020dce9e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1051668,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathalie Durand","original_name":"Nathalie Durand","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/aWnlb0ongZupLPFJQp5AFDnM4e9.jpg","credit_id":"5ec965b6a35c8e0020e28de2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32509,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathilde Muyard","original_name":"Mathilde Muyard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec965bdeb79c2001fa2024b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0320255","wikidata_id":"Q96650177","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cmSh42cbrs1nZdpupecIkctIzyM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8hrKNiPMmhV2wVL6bwV8rXNlK20.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
