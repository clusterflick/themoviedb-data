Each found his way into southern Arizona's Sonoran Desert in the late 1950sâ€”Webb building his colossal, panoptically-planned retirement community Sun City and Reich conducting his weather manipulation experiments using Orgone Energy. Using found footage, documentary interviews, and narrative tableaux, the film interweaves contradictory narratives and critically poetic observations.","popularity":0.1012,"poster_path":"/93OHl509qjandiVBFQctqe6CD2L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wasteland Utopias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Sherman","original_name":"David Sherman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e5c523c3a3685a9600804d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93OHl509qjandiVBFQctqe6CD2L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
