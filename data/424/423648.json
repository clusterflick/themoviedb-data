The carefully applied makeup and wig tell of disguise and acting, and are simultaneously beautiful and terribly stony like the anonymous woman´s head. The brevity and slow speed are reminiscent of Andy Warhol´s Screen Tests, in which every single one of the face´s movements become visible.” – Brigitta Burger-Utzer","popularity":0.0489,"poster_path":"/dp86s4bXv7Ubq2KSAWm6IpRqoHv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Portrait with Head","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valie Export","original_name":"Valie Export","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/tl9mnr8YhhvdIwRBKr7LohARBRH.jpg","credit_id":"581778b5c3a3686db401b567","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dp86s4bXv7Ubq2KSAWm6IpRqoHv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1970}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
