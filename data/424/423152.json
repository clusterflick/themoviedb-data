When Johnny's mother-in-law tells them to take Junior to the dentist to have a tooth pulled, and gives them $2 for the doctor, the game is afoot. The money goes to Henry's bookie, and the boys decide to pull Junior's tooth themselves... by tying a string onto the back bumper of a car. But a pet parrot spills the beans, and mother-in-law goes chasing after them with fire in her eye, and a fireplace poker under her coat.","popularity":0.3163,"poster_path":"/aHElXLtyH1LJrw94w2mIZRWlphz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
