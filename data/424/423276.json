As the wild energy of the scene burned out their adolescent dreams met the realities of adulthood. But the scene had a lasting legacy on their lives - once a B Boy, always a B Boy... and then a tragic event gives them an unexpected chance to recapture the past. Previously unseen archive footage shines the light on a forgotten era in British youth culture in this humorous and poignant character-driven documentary.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NG83 - When We Were B Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5614720","wikidata_id":"Q24706334","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
