Details from the Greek island of Hydra, a figure, a study in light and place and the act of creation.  The first half of the film explores delicate nuances of lighting, colour and depth as Beavers shoots the face of a young man in various locales on the Greek island of Hydra, using a variety of customized masks and filters. The manâ€™s face remains constant throughout, surrounded by iconic elements in the landscape, like a pulsating Renaissance portrait. Still Light brings to mind any number of structuralist binarisms: youth and age, creation and criticism, action and reflection, living landscape and mummified text.\r (Ed Halter, New York Press).","popularity":0.0657,"poster_path":"/bLTKFzeBxtLviW3lc1k8Zv1N3WD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67af37ee80f76d61eb8e6d73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5253881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Krueck","original_name":"Ron Krueck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67b41b655aca5a71d29ff2cc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5817f4e192514137bd00011f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5QONnVKCUcfZ9Huk9FcpB3VzYYL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/92F80BmOzafZrjaFMlDpWOQS21e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bLTKFzeBxtLviW3lc1k8Zv1N3WD.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jkXfzkRTnTQMQY9W5c3xWz2w1nM.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/shoQ5qq9vEQha2IuUBv4wGMop2S.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2771,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cdT4LJMwHCP1y50yz1rlYPkU0nY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1847},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1919,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f5cy7yr7NU7s4xwWjCUGxRgwYZc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1279}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Anthology Film Archives","release_date":"1973-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Museum of Modern Art","release_date":"1974-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Goethe House, New York","release_date":"1971-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
