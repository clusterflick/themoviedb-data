The rest of the film presents luscious shots of a wooded stream and hazy glen, portrayed with the careful composition of 19th century landscape painting. An ineffable, unnameable immanence flows through the images of The Stoas, a kind of presence of the human soul expressed through the sympathetic absence of the human figure.”\r (Ed Halter, New York Press)","popularity":0.0665,"poster_path":"/rIGVwgMGqK61xGBZqOaig9PqlMp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stoas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5817f2be925141353f0000bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0301898","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8uxeVWYgnRGw1TpYfgAMssyzun4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rIGVwgMGqK61xGBZqOaig9PqlMp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2UEgtpQSZ85gIfH5OlEt7r68Xm9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pBfYf8ihYnd48dJ68j1Y2Pg5fMp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i5An1svooT7PzGJr1cKmF8D0tqO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Toronto Film Festival","release_date":"2000-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"1999-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"1997-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
