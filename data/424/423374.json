He became the first Jamaican writer to win the Man Booker prize for his magisterial novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, about the events surrounding the attempted assassination of Bob Marley and their aftermath. He also chose to come out as gay in an article for the New York Times - a brave move for a man born in what has been called the world's most homophobic country. Alan Yentob accompanies the charismatic and provocative James back to Jamaica and finds in his three highly praised novels a complex portrait of the turbulent history of his native country.","popularity":0.27,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seven Killings of Marlon James","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1701205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlon James","original_name":"Marlon James","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5814dd939251415abb0015aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5814dd9dc3a368766900160b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1701204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colette Camden","original_name":"Colette Camden","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5814dd869251415c5e00176d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
