Instead, the first half is a compilation of faux-snuff vignettes akin to something you’d find in a SOV horror collection like Snuff Perversions 1 &amp; 2, Snuff Files, The Dead Files, Violations I &amp; II, or even more recent titles like Murder Collection Volume 1. The second half is in turn a send-up of satanic panic style videos like Law Enforcement Guide to Satanic Cults, Devil Worship: The Rise Of Satanism, and countless others shat out during the 80s/90s. The vignettes are hilariously inept to the point where it seems clear that Causey was parodying the shockumentary form. Even the credits are a joke, mocking the seriousness with which shocku producers take themselves, crediting a ‘researcher’ for a film that clearly had none, and a ‘visual archivist’ being listed in place of a cameraman.","popularity":0.2309,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cannibal Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empire of Madness","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"True Gore II","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Wilson","original_name":"Paula Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5818b9d09251414988006f8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zodia","original_name":"Zodia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5818b9e1c3a36838460074f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Montgomery","original_name":"George Montgomery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5818b9fc92514137500073bc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.
