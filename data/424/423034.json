Her best friend, Mickey, a gay man who had tried unsuccessfully to adopt a child, also feels the pangs of parental yearning. The couple decides to have a naturally conceived child together. Mickey moves in with Annie, but she then meets Gordon, the man of her dreams with whom she has a passionate fling. Annie finds herself pregnant and not exactly sure which of the two men in her life is the father. But commitment-shy Gordon wants nothing to do with the child. Mickey eventually assures Annie that no matter what, he will help raise the child as his, together as a family with Annie.","popularity":2.3088,"poster_path":"/pnuArLbBvTGNxzp0UXRwPTeXzZ6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ken Raskoff
