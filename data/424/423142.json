And a terrifying and mysterious horned creature. And a mute girl locked up in the attic. From this familiar but decent premise, director Lu Shiyu makes his film an endless – though only 80 minutes long – series of shrieky nightmare sequences (the main character wakes up with a jolt roughly once every two minutes), ham-fisted flashbacks and trite stalking scenes.","popularity":0.1251,"poster_path":"/ei3M8AaNgoyHfQ36ibIW4ExZMRQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horrible Mansion in Wild Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Horrible Masion in Wild Village","type":"Typo in official posters"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Huang cun xiong jian","type":"Romanized Mandarin"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kara Wai Ying-Hung","original_name":"惠英紅","popularity":1.2808,"profile_path":"/6OV9kM62Y7M7EswtkpCThs0QAxg.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lu Shiyu","credit_id":"58362eaac3a36836a90047cf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lu Shi-Yu","original_name":"Lu Shi-Yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64883468bf31f250569d26c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6419560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgqt4dxxiL8UngO56Migp32Ddlr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":2600,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/ei3M8AaNgoyHfQ36ibIW4ExZMRQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
