THE ONTOLOGICAL COWBOY documents Foreman’s invocation of the \"manifest destiny\" of the avant-garde theater, King Cowboy Rufus strolling down off San Juan Hill with a sigh, waving his handkerchief. Foreman plays himself, and the cast pantomimes his preoccupations. If \"the cast and crew suffer alike,\" it’s all for a good cause: the violent rebirth of the American theater, with Foreman as its midwife.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ontological Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Foreman","original_name":"Richard Foreman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"581506689251415abb002e9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":189883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliana Francis","original_name":"Juliana Francis","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"581506709251415cd100305b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Smith","original_name":"Jay Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5815067cc3a3687557002ae8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1701312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ryder Smith","original_name":"Tom Ryder Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58150685c3a3687669003028","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Losier","original_name":"Marie Losier","popularity":0.2863,"profile_path":"/4dwd7fUTjHyPZJ9eDZmxVfrdUlI.jpg","credit_id":"581506579251415ab8002f79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1549933","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Onion City Experimental Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2005-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
