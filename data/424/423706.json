Nature is always a construction, whether in dynamic processes, dis-analog systems or physical, technical signals. 'Nature' formulates the organizational forms of representational strategies - symbolic structures, both in reality and in fiction. Where are the borders, the interfaces, the de-bordering and the analogies for ‘natural’ nature and ‘technical’ nature? These considerations provided the basis for the video.” – VALIE EXPORT","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/cDqsOA7NKZzA0FJQqZ7uzMpCIX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Duality of Nature","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valie Export","original_name":"Valie Export","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/tl9mnr8YhhvdIwRBKr7LohARBRH.jpg","credit_id":"5817c3a09251415bdc01f855","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cDqsOA7NKZzA0FJQqZ7uzMpCIX8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
