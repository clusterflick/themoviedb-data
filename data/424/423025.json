There was no evidence and no confession. Only rumors. Maria and the witnesses re-enact the trial before the camera. They tell about the marriage, the time the husband was a prisoner of war and his return from captivity. If he really had been poisoned or if she was a victim of injustice remains open. Maria Zechmeister was pardoned after serving 17 years in prison and lives in an isolated house at the outskirts of the village.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":"/bkXAliYDSlteyhFvmVRyaGZeETS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Studio
