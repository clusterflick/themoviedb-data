The tour, which grossed a total of $163.5 million, included a total of 82 concerts attended by 4.5 million fans. This would be the singer's last tour. During the performance of Earth Song, Jackson, (who was hanging from a crane) was interfered with by a Korean fan who climbed the crane just to meet Jackson. Michael stayed with the man because there was a risk of falling. The man was taken away by security after the crane was lowered. This concert was released commercially on VHS in Korea. Before the release of the 1992 Dangerous Tour in Bucharest, this concert was the only commercially released concert.","popularity":0.0927,"poster_path":"/nprHLDVMAxxMxeZ4w1ccPuXlC7l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Jackson: History Tour World Tour - Live in Seoul","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jackson","original_name":"Michael Jackson","popularity":1.244,"profile_path":"/tWHyifIcUEc1E0ufIZq5JqyeF6R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66c50a86a4778b358b24dce9","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAHWyuP7UKDRaEr08hgUzery9cH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nprHLDVMAxxMxeZ4w1ccPuXlC7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
