Its subtitle refers to a 1915 song composed by Ralph Chaplin as an anthem for unionized workers. The film itself is the cinematic version of that anthem, as it allows us a comprehensive understanding of the need for these early labor unions, and the enormous sacrifices of its members to ensure fairness, safety, and equality in the workplace.","popularity":0.3496,"poster_path":"/q9zr0Z63zPkaNrew8C1HtpLyif0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7075,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metanoia Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plutocracy II: Solidarity Forever","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Noble","original_name":"Scott Noble","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58178d4dc3a36873d901a30a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q9zr0Z63zPkaNrew8C1HtpLyif0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
