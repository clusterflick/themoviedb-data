Despite working daily with blows and blows, his life is calm and peaceful, as he prefers to focus on the peaceful and poetic side of the Eastern philosophies that form the basis of fights. Therefore, he is a kind of \"guru\" for the city's children. However, everything changes in Josh's life when Lisa is taken hostage during a criminal action. Negotiations between the bandits and the police become more tense with each passing moment. Commissioner Jackie Winter and her partner Mehmet Schulz, from the anti-crime division, have no other option and enlist the help of Josh, also known as Der Puma. It is in this extreme situation, disturbed by the tension of seeing her one step away from death, that Josh will be forced to use all his knowledge and techniques to try to save Lisa's life.","popularity":0.5144,"poster_path":"/1GyMNS5ExvQApjs2BfyigjKVA5m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Puma - Kämpfer mit Herz","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Hardt","original_name":"Mickey Hardt","popularity":0.2891,"profile_path":"/y5gykopulr1D3sZg0ApCZMGqQs7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Josh Angel","credit_id":"62f1b9fe85b1050080259c0c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Becker","original_name":"Rolf Becker","popularity":0.4155,"profile_path":"/eik3TSY86XzPgpCFBEQPNjNwRmS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Charly Engel","credit_id":"62f1be2077e1f600824cf91d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ercan Durmaz","original_name":"Ercan Durmaz","popularity":0.4241,"profile_path":"/mkcF1iILzKyEBnw4ABKOicBS0r4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mehmet Schulz","credit_id":"62f1be3323be46007dbb3185","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Hoss","original_name":"Susanne Hoss","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/2RnDbQSN9Tt3oI8FiHZ6HHL87rQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jackie Winter","credit_id":"62f1be45514c4a007f8bc25b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandar Jovanović","original_name":"Aleksandar Jovanović","popularity":0.4404,"profile_path":"/qm7jEZsYbbmwpe9nt3sJqRtWOA4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Karl Scherler","credit_id":"62f1be60db72c0007a05df7f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Nickel","original_name":"Jochen Nickel","popularity":0.336,"profile_path":"/mVNh33yMHoTneAF2OrsC4nvwBGL.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Carlo Bless","credit_id":"62f1be75813cb600806dcdac","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel de Roche","original_name":"Axel de Roche","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f1ba4b813cb600923ad358","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donnie Yen","original_name":"甄子丹","popularity":2.69,"profile_path":"/hTlhrrZMj8hZVvD17j4KyAFWBHc.jpg","credit_id":"67872aee2b1e40e83fbb28b9","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Woods","original_name":"Michael Woods","popularity":0.1353,"profile_path":"/xFGWrcEJiy8gDYDhdrcruZdBgqC.jpg","credit_id":"67872b5e2256023dfd4eb0f4","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenji Tanigaki","original_name":"谷垣健治","popularity":0.5014,"profile_path":"/2ZV2n02pZq1Sc2szQuyF1HVssi7.jpg","credit_id":"67872b7294fc87ef487b82cf","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3A4az57R9v2H6qkYXm8oi6RxkD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/1GyMNS5ExvQApjs2BfyigjKVA5m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
