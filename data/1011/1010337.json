Film footage and photos taken in the beginning of the 1970s in the village of Maïné-Soroa, in Eastern Niger, are juxtaposed with audio-visual material from Tromsø in Northern Norway. Using a simple, didactic voice-over, the film questions many stereotypes about women’s life in Africa and Norway. It is an attempt to use audio-visual tools and fieldwork experience to teach cross-cultural understanding and ethnocentrism in Norway.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nihhHT9Bap7XL8TknFRM4yaS3ry.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Niger-Norway","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3591455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisbet Holtedahl","original_name":"Lisbet Holtedahl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f20c19db72c0007fcdd12a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nihhHT9Bap7XL8TknFRM4yaS3ry.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
