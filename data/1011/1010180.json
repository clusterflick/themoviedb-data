The French army, along with 1,800 Indian allies, bombarded the fort over six long days. The British subjects in the fort held out for as long as they could…and would ultimately suffer a fate worse than surrender.  Using historic journals from men on both sides of the conflict, this documentary recounts the events.  Through filmed reenactments and animations, the story of the siege and surrounding events come to life.","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/fIBxazzUI7lG3cS9V86zPWSeT6Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194804,"logo_path":null,"name":"EKS Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story behind “The Last of the Mohicans” told by the men who were there.","title":"The Siege of Fort William Henry","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Albert","original_name":"Thierry Albert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Father Pierre Roubaud (voice)","credit_id":"62f1832d880c9200828ef489","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Bones","original_name":"Craig Bones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"William Johnson (voice)","credit_id":"62f1833b514c4a007ab5c635","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Cawton","original_name":"Ross Cawton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"George Bartman (voice)","credit_id":"62f18345df857c007fb0b61f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Cichowicz","original_name":"David Cichowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Joseph Frye (voice)","credit_id":"62f1834f3503980082129a69","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc De Villars","original_name":"Luc De Villars","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Marquis de Montcalm (voice)","credit_id":"62f1835c514c4a0082919202","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Dixon","original_name":"Jack Dixon","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Colonel George Monro (voice)","credit_id":"62f1836785b105007df10445","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rik Jones","original_name":"Rik Jones","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"James Furnis (voice)","credit_id":"62f183791f748b007cc910ad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Obadia","original_name":"Jacques Obadia","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Louis Antoine De Bougainville (voice)","credit_id":"62f1838377e1f6007ad48bd9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Roberts","original_name":"Eric Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"35th Regiment Soldier","credit_id":"62f18397db72c00091a42b8b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686991,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erik Swanson","original_name":"Erik Swanson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f182ca514c4a007ab5c61d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14536840","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fIBxazzUI7lG3cS9V86zPWSeT6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
