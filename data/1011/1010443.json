He headed the International Longshoremen and Warehouseman Union from the 1930's to the 1970's and was a champion of workers' causes on an international scale.  Harry Bridges (July 28, 1901 - March 30, 1990) was controversial as he was charismatic. He was prosecuted by FDR, Truman and Eisenhower alike, and convicted by a federal jury for having lied about Communist Party membership-a conviction which was set aside. On the West Coast, Bridges still excites passions both for and against the labor movement.","popularity":0.0923,"poster_path":"/gUQ9m4JWqNawbE5nJqBXYJqQZ5p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harry Bridges: A Man and His Union","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3656881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Bridges","original_name":"Harry Bridges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archival footage)","credit_id":"62f2530e5be00e0091921c32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Studs Terkel","original_name":"Studs Terkel","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/weQxTiTG49Zejd3UHjocrVtyRxk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"62f253231511aa0091a0ca74","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107081","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gUQ9m4JWqNawbE5nJqBXYJqQZ5p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":573},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mFMVreB1EH7sGyu0wVaMu5eYxAS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
