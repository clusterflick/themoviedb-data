He takes a job in the yard owned by the man to whose daughter he was engaged in happier times. Three German propagandists seek to foment a strike to delay the work, and largely through Tom's efforts the plan goes amiss and the strike is called off. Rehabilitated by work, the launching of The Liberty is a forecast of his own rebirth.","popularity":0.4765,"poster_path":"/eSfpFgsIWHN10vbBTYntSDKebqP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road to France","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlyle Blackwell","original_name":"Carlyle Blackwell","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/rVXhwWrYMW1bwxobOAP0ZXG1Zby.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom Whitney","credit_id":"62f27068514c4a007f8c0d09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Greeley","original_name":"Evelyn Greeley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/2kGszcsvdMrG8fdzgIwWzFqvx2D.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Helen Bemis","credit_id":"62f2785c594c94007f47809d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1982067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Drumier","original_name":"Jack Drumier","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/zlP3ZtlDIEp3ZdTgJlUYCpk1zLy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Bemis","credit_id":"62f2786b85b105008025e975","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Ostriche","original_name":"Muriel Ostriche","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/ct7En93rzAtSSntfO9GkQqHYCZ7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mollie","credit_id":"62f286f3880c9200828f607d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Neill","original_name":"Richard Neill","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/jolpsR5bhdTugkNpnBQYgt0q9Vh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hector Winter","credit_id":"62f2872985b105008025ed53","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph W.
