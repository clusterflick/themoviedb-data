Alaudin discovers that Habib was part of a rich lost history of mid-20th century Harlem, in which Bengali Muslim men, dodging racist Asian Exclusion laws, married into New York's African American and Puerto Rican communities - and in which the likes of Malcolm X and Miles Davis shared space and broke bread with immigrants from the subcontinent. He also unearths the hardships and trauma that his mother overcame to become one of the first women to immigrate to the U.S. from rural Bangladesh. In Search of Bengali Harlem is a transformative journey, not just for Alaudin Ullah, but for our understanding of the complex histories of South Asians and Muslims in the United States.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/n8xd6RTyh8aDCHAT9CvFcD80K2B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of Bengali Harlem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivek Renjen Bald","original_name":"Vivek Renjen Bald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631150dd7fcab30091dbd8da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aladdin Ullah","original_name":"Aladdin Ullah","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63115105c048a9008fe902e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1049690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susannah Ludwig","original_name":"Susannah Ludwig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a90ad6e4b57600917a23a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17013522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1988,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n8xd6RTyh8aDCHAT9CvFcD80K2B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1325}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco International South Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
