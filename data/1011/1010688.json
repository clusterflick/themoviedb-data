Yet, as a teenager, he also represents a new generation of young Tibetans who are caught today between the peaceful traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and a desperate desire to fight for the freedom of their people. These young Tibetans speak about the slow obliteration of their very identity – their livelihoods, their right to choose where they live, their ability to be educated in their languages – and the stark choice they face of either remaining in Tibetan areas under these constraints or seeking to flee to other countries.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yHnxsxYuCULSVvbBXV2cwLzoLYk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Country is Tibet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3657758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Namgyal Wangchuk Lhagyari Trichen","original_name":"Namgyal Wangchuk Lhagyari Trichen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62f2ecb9db72c0007fce165a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3657758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Namgyal Wangchuk Lhagyari Trichen","original_name":"Namgyal Wangchuk Lhagyari Trichen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f2ec92fea6e3007d078a23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yHnxsxYuCULSVvbBXV2cwLzoLYk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
