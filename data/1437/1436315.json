These include an ammonite, small vertebrate, turtle carapace, and a sample yet to be identified. 3D print (on supports) of the void areas of ammonite fossil generated from scanning.  The video work soundscape includes ‘Uamh an Òir’ (Cave of Gold), a Gaelic song describing the legend of a piper who, along with his faithful dog enters the Cave of Gold never to return. In some versions of the story, the pipers’ music can be heard coming from the ground, gradually getting fainter. His dog emerges from the cave hairless, most likely after encountering the cave’s fearsome guardian – a green faery hound. Uamh an Òir is arranged and performed by Caleb Wilson, recorded by Richy Carey at èist sound, Cinnseaborg, set amongst a soundscape composed by both artists.
