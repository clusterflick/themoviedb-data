The film takes us into this state, which manifests itself by following the character in a skewed version of reality, riddled with amnesia.  Mysterious pearls start to appear and the sounds they make trigger memories in our protagonist, which eventually help him to return.  The story can be described as magical realism, suggestive and at times terrifying.","popularity":0.5799,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":249086,"logo_path":"/mBLX88PCxzOCaMzgZbmVrxhG6qn.png","name":"Filmregion Sydost","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":253864,"logo_path":"/2mcoP22S51G4Oo1xuMqV7xBP7c3.png","name":"Cinematik","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":253867,"logo_path":"/uZcPa90eRxN3VbgW8T9i4yrEywJ.png","name":"En Jävla Mutant","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2025-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nacre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5253574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filip Svensson","original_name":"Filip Svensson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67b3e720f47a8b922a6dd252","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5156656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Nilsson","original_name":"Peter Nilsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67b3e72be5e1a7ed7ce11917","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5156658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Magnusson","original_name":"Cecilia Magnusson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67b3e7375b8c789e849fcc47","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5156644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Cederholm","original_name":"Johan Cederholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/znLw1ntCRqeM23SD1Ia3xhFjGzD.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67b3e741aaac3b1674e0fac5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5156655,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Magnusson","original_name":"Victoria Magnusson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67b3e74bf47a8b922a6dd25a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5156644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Cederholm","original_name":"Johan Cederholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/znLw1ntCRqeM23SD1Ia3xhFjGzD.jpg","credit_id":"67b3e43b91d7e66c656dbae7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5156644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Cederholm","original_name":"Johan Cederholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/znLw1ntCRqeM23SD1Ia3xhFjGzD.jpg","credit_id":"67b3e44891d7e66c656dbaf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5156644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Cederholm","original_name":"Johan Cederholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/znLw1ntCRqeM23SD1Ia3xhFjGzD.jpg","credit_id":"67b3e45220acfec4ece0d5fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5156644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Cederholm","original_name":"Johan Cederholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/znLw1ntCRqeM23SD1Ia3xhFjGzD.jpg","credit_id":"67b3e460f35d4102096dbe17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4743783,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoffer Moe Ditlevsen","original_name":"Christoffer Moe Ditlevsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b3e5915b8c789e849fcc0a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5253579,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mikael Berglund","original_name":"Mikael Berglund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b3e76ee5e1a7ed7ce1192c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5253579,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mikael Berglund","original_name":"Mikael Berglund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b3e795f8cf4734519faa6a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5156655,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Magnusson","original_name":"Victoria Magnusson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b3e7ae46338672f7e0d2eb","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/z3CXHcT9itVCAXyk4x1nNAvMG1X.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/6h7UGvA30MhU0D3UDXGdeVZLuyA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
