From meager roots in North Dakota, Eielson developed an insatiable thirst for conquering the skies. With frozen fortitude, Eielson achieved the unthinkable-the first aerial crossing of the North Pole. But the lure of heroics proved fateful.

This gripping saga follows Eielson's meteoritic rise from prairie obscurity to Arctic legend, culminating in that ill-fated final flight into the annals of adventure.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ztSjXrZCZ1F0PLwcFOaGuU5isrz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over the Top of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Tack","original_name":"David Tack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67b6181cd28e87e0e5e3e827","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kuznicki","original_name":"David Kuznicki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b617c13751180bfcdffa71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kuznicki","original_name":"David Kuznicki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b617d13751180bfcdffa79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31472797","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztSjXrZCZ1F0PLwcFOaGuU5isrz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":808}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
