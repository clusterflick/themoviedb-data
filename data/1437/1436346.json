She must take care of her home as she takes care of her flesh. This care is a struggle passed down through generations. It is through ritual and sexuality that Louise engages in it; a struggle where belonging to oneself is a victory. Accompanied by a letter she writes to herself, Louise embarks on a day of ritualistic and symbolic actions to help her body metabolize the transition from violence to belonging. Working and splitting wood, tending the fire, listening to the snow melt, immersing herself in her own being, loving her body, and reclaiming pleasure within it.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Flesh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Alba","original_name":"Louise Alba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67b4b49bd44dcafe0f9fb64a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4546216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"AXGE","original_name":"AXGE","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4b4b14e89ccd7886e2562","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Filministes 2025, Montréal, Québec, Canada","release_date":"2025-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
