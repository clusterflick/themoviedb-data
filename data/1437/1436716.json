I picked the palm fronds because they are the most useless things in California – they’re what we have to sweep away after a windy day. It was an experiment in registering people’s reaction to a fundamental question about the value of objects. And I was referencing two historical pieces: David Hammons’s Bliz-aard Ball Sale [1983], where he sold snowballs during winter in New York; and a Japanese manga called Munou no Hito [A Worthless Person, 1985], in which the protagonist sells stones by the riverside – stones being sold alongside stones. So both shared quite similar ideas.\" - Koki Tanaka","popularity":0.0851,"poster_path":"/zVxYjWkywBZo1Xgh3aWiiZ2fnl8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253984,"logo_path":null,"name":"The BOX Gallery","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Contemporary artist Koki Tanaka sets up a booth at a Los Angeles flea market to sell palm fronds.","title":"Someone's Junk is Someone else's Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5256457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koki Tanaka","original_name":"Koki Tanaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b5995f60b18a5698dfc68a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5256464,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naotaka Hiro","original_name":"Naotaka Hiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b599fbd28e87e0e5e3b2fe","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5256459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara MacCarthy","original_name":"Mara MacCarthy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b59a1b902f5e20a688adcf","department":"Production","job":"Coordinating Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5256460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilary Graves","original_name":"Hilary Graves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b59a2e9e32f72b4d88b8cd","department":"Production","job":"Coordinating Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5256461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Underhill","original_name":"Jason Underhill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b59a3a9e32f72b4d88b8d0","department":"Production","job":"Coordinating Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034267,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Taku Unami","original_name":"Taku Unami","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b59a672152638f5ee3bbcc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5256457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koki Tanaka","original_name":"Koki Tanaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5a07b9e32f72b4d88bb71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1699,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fCyhUM5R4jLfGRRXxx76muPjpbU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3024}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1567,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVxYjWkywBZo1Xgh3aWiiZ2fnl8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1045}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
