It’s a place where friends, lovers and eccentric figures pass through, haunting his canvases after a mysterious creative alchemy. Bacon explains in French his carnal relationship with his canvases, the painters who inspire him, and his relationship with alcohol, violence and death. He talks about his homosexuality, his personal life and the way it spills over into his painting. An exceptional portrait captured on the spot, over the course of a rambling, inebriated conversation.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/ykFcytMNv8DsArbBdvS2zsLGVgY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Francis Bacon, peintre anglais","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Bacon","original_name":"Francis Bacon","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/2OBaxds5qpXh1sBOuZF4shxVrYO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67b5cd8860b18a5698dfda77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5256815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emile de Harven","original_name":"Emile de Harven","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67b5cd999e32f72b4d88d472","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Koralnik","original_name":"Pierre Koralnik","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5cce2d28e87e0e5e3c606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13449892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9VMnQZGG0OK60JRXJN3086ycwUr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ykFcytMNv8DsArbBdvS2zsLGVgY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Francis Bacon, peintre anglais (1964)","key":"h0iWdjh4Xkg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2017-04-27T17:00:04.000Z","id":"67b5cdc560b18a5698dfdaa0"}]}}}
