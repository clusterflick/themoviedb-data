Her objective is to create a new narrative around periods for her daughter, which she knows she can only accomplish by freeing herself. Her insistence of digging beneath the surface and her refusal to be limited by patriarchy’s negative views on periods lead her to look into her own family story and explore the concept of trans generational trauma.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/keBG96lnjNsXwZe1EvlIdXMmUQA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I bleed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2546188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephanie Nassar","original_name":"Stephanie Nassar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b51856b687e738f15663e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5255646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leah Manasseh","original_name":"Leah Manasseh","popularity":0.1348,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5185f23664282c03435d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090105,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anoushka Marien","original_name":"Anoushka Marien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5186cf46f81c0b556638e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5255695,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Haitham Atme","original_name":"Haitham Atme","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5188ccfb338ec5b583c56","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Al Abiad","original_name":"Lynn Al Abiad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5189ad438ba214e343c63","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/keBG96lnjNsXwZe1EvlIdXMmUQA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
