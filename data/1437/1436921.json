He has recently separated from his wife and now has a live-in boyfriend. While supportive of her son's authentic self-expression, Fiona is skeptical of the circumstances under which this all happened. Not only did her son leave his wife, but they had children together and Dalton gave up custody. To make matters worse, the new boyfriend, Bram, doesn't seem too enthusiastic about having Fiona as a houseguest. As more is uncovered regarding Dalton's new relationship as well as details of Bram's shady past, depravity and hilarity ensue.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/EF72tctLsqEzVkGqbATO6xUjRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244833,"logo_path":null,"name":"Line Break Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Bram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4139785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Maltz","original_name":"Ryan Maltz","popularity":0.2143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dalton","credit_id":"67b61f8a902f5e20a688e3aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucinda Holshue","original_name":"Lucinda Holshue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fiona","credit_id":"67b61f972152638f5ee3fb1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Hildebrandt","original_name":"Bradley Hildebrandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bram","credit_id":"67b61fa560b18a5698e004e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Cornelius","original_name":"Rebecca Cornelius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Steen","credit_id":"67b61fbf2152638f5ee3fb97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2774451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cullen Arbaugh","original_name":"Cullen Arbaugh","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Gator","credit_id":"67b61fcd3751180bfcdfffcd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Reeves","original_name":"Cameron Reeves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Talon","credit_id":"67b61fed60b18a5698e0052c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Hildebrandt","original_name":"Bradley Hildebrandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b61ee43751180bfcdffeb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2774451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cullen Arbaugh","original_name":"Cullen Arbaugh","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b61ef4902f5e20a688e31e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2774451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cullen Arbaugh","original_name":"Cullen Arbaugh","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b61f04d28e87e0e5e3ea75","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Hildebrandt","original_name":"Bradley Hildebrandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b61f14d28e87e0e5e3ea8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34851865","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@bram_movie","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/EF72tctLsqEzVkGqbATO6xUjRG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":744},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oTpUMvKYdQ3t1Ma9FXHEAkpO0wX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
