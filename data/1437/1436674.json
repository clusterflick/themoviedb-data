I investigate when and how my depression began and explain that my relationships with the people I love have supported me through my harder times. The film incorporates footage shot over May and June 2023 and archival home videos. Overall, I aim to resolve my \"growing pains\" through the medium of diary film and by reconnecting with my younger self.","popularity":0.3526,"poster_path":"/5Bb8uShQQxnQfqgxY629Wyq90Qc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Layering","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5256195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Eaton","original_name":"Grace Eaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/A4WSFh7aLFsHyloYFLwKAxGVPcQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b5625560b18a5698dfaec6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5256195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Eaton","original_name":"Grace Eaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/A4WSFh7aLFsHyloYFLwKAxGVPcQ.jpg","credit_id":"67b55d312152638f5ee39ec1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5256195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Eaton","original_name":"Grace Eaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/A4WSFh7aLFsHyloYFLwKAxGVPcQ.jpg","credit_id":"67b55d472152638f5ee39ede","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5256195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Eaton","original_name":"Grace Eaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/A4WSFh7aLFsHyloYFLwKAxGVPcQ.jpg","credit_id":"67b55d5a60b18a5698dfadba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5Bb8uShQQxnQfqgxY629Wyq90Qc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":221021,"name":"diary film"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":296071,"name":"experimental documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Screening at Robarts Library in Toronto","release_date":"2023-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
