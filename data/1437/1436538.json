Zenon is a product of the most up-to-date technology and so displays an unusual characteristic for a computer: he is conscious. Orbiting the Earth, he is in constant contact with Estelle, who is in charge of a major, planet-wide research project on water. Faced with the disturbing situation he observes, Zenon soon becomes bitter and disillusioned--to the point where he substantially alters his mission. Could Zenon's creator, the mysterious Professor Nguyen, have foretold how the mission would turn out?","popularity":0.1047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Aquanaut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Josée Gauthier","original_name":"Marie-Josée Gauthier","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Stella","credit_id":"67b5131db687e738f1566319","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khanh Hua","original_name":"Khanh Hua","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":"/ydio2Boy6DxeWN7HSRtZdYTV5sy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr Léon Nguyen","credit_id":"67b5133623664282c0343396","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean L'Italien","original_name":"Jean L'Italien","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/qBQg7NfcL8UiNYNC5Tqiifc1mEt.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vincent","credit_id":"67b51341c36e139e855665ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3158434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Knight","original_name":"Adrian Knight","popularity":0.1729,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Zenon (voice)","credit_id":"67b5136123664282c03433a3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannie Walker","original_name":"Jeannie Walker","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"67b5139223664282c03433cb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Hellman","original_name":"Mark Hellman","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"67b513b003824271375665a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dumont","original_name":"Richard Dumont","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/lamnVMR5RYtuap4d9NvRXaldT2T.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"67b513c5c36e139e85566626","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz MacRae","original_name":"Liz MacRae","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"67b513cf03824271375665ba","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5255657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Céline Mineau","original_name":"Céline Mineau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b512ac5e3e4076cc583999","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Murray","original_name":"Michel Murray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b512bc8a003b233d343675","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Fielden","original_name":"Hubert Fielden","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b512cbb687e738f15662d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Murray","original_name":"Michel Murray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b512e15e3e4076cc5839ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Fielden","original_name":"Hubert Fielden","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b512f10c304c8345343463","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jocelyn Therrien","original_name":"Jocelyn Therrien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b513de01820bf8af583853","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194592,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André-Luc Dupont","original_name":"André-Luc Dupont","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b513f001820bf8af583864","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0236996","wikidata_id":"Q3519800","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
