A light light flickers, illuminating the past, present, and future. I'll see you at the DMZ!  Shim was a free, one-day pop-up cafe staged in Yangji-ri village’s air raid shelter at the Korean DMZ. Referencing Korean cafe culture’s fixation on third place, the DMZ’s evolution from security tourism, to ecological peace tourism, and its repurposing as art production site, Shim attempts to intervene and align the past and present.  Yangji-ri was one of many minbuk propaganda villages established by the Park Chung Hee regime in the 1960s to showcase the farming bounty and prosperity of the south for a North Korean gaze. The village was formerly part of the Civilian Control Line (CCL) until 2013 when it was reterritorialized as a normal part of South Korea.","popularity":0.7422,"poster_path":"/681WRKXpfGsnR0e3m6qApFJhvdA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The DMZ is dreaming again","title":"Shim: American Opens a Cafe at the DMZ","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"American Artist","credit_id":"67b4bf201ed45284539fc345","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Villagers","original_name":"Villagers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"67b4bf8320acfec4ece0ed33","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DMZ","original_name":"DMZ","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b4bfa56113c493dc6e0abc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Korean cafe worker","credit_id":"67b4c30cf35d4102096ddb82","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4bfd36113c493dc6e0ade","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4bff420acfec4ece0ed56","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4c00e5b8c789e849fe179","department":"Crew","job":"Craft Service"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254935,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4c0205b8c789e849fe18a","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4c0334e89ccd7886e2802","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254937,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kim Westfall","original_name":"Kim Westfall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4c0444e89ccd7886e2814","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/681WRKXpfGsnR0e3m6qApFJhvdA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3264,"name":"korean war (1950-53)"},{"id":34061,"name":"american abroad"},{"id":179321,"name":"asian woman"},{"id":244029,"name":"dmz"},{"id":261681,"name":"south korea"},{"id":311889,"name":"cafe owner"},{"id":327420,"name":"kpop"},{"id":343516,"name":"café"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
