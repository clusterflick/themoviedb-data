In the time of making of this film, more than 14 million Syrians have been forced to leave their homes. Syrians asked for asylum in more than 130 countries. Reem, Mohammed and Yasser try to make sense of what is left of the Syrian Revolution. Little Syria is a confidential insight into the invisible lives of Syrian refugees.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/l1Ddv37195LPSycWYwHJtbIQVzL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Passport Productions","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":254044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Make a Point","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Syria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5257683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reem Karssli","original_name":"Reem Karssli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b645d799998623c1146064","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2115664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madalina Rosca","original_name":"Madalina Rosca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b64618806050f581523fe2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5257697,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Arne Wagner","original_name":"Paul Arne Wagner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b6462b64def0053f14600e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2115664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madalina Rosca","original_name":"Madalina Rosca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b64641fea8f116b33aded2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2115664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madalina Rosca","original_name":"Madalina Rosca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b64abe64def0053f14658e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5257683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reem Karssli","original_name":"Reem Karssli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b64ac364def0053f146594","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2831,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l1Ddv37195LPSycWYwHJtbIQVzL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Little Syria | Official Trailer","key":"s-8KIXrSFlc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-14T16:00:06.000Z","id":"67b64aac0dd22ec79c3ae49e"}]}}}
