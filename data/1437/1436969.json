The rich will pay to escape global warming, famine and conflict, while the poorest will suffer the worst consequences. By 2050, Bangladesh will have approximately 220 million inhabitants and a large part of its territory will be permanently submerged.This situation could lead to the forced displacement of between 10 and 30 million inhabitants of the country's southern coastline, forcing many Bangladeshis to flee the country as \"climate refugees\", a human collective that is expected to reach 250 million people worldwide by mid-century.On a planetary scale, we are talking about the largest mass migration in human history. How long will Dhaka be able to cope with the influx of so many people, where will these people go when the cities collapse, who will take them in?We are sitting on a big time bomb.","popularity":0.1499,"poster_path":"/jYlnkSR1qdh0uGiix14zdPxyZnQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152182,"logo_path":null,"name":"En Buen Sitio Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2025-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697139,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Natxo Leuza","original_name":"Natxo Leuza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b63ba20dd22ec79c3adc24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697139,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Natxo Leuza","original_name":"Natxo Leuza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b63ba62b0abc8c4d523c84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040264,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucía Benito","original_name":"Lucía Benito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b63bb00dd22ec79c3adc2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040262,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jokin Pascual","original_name":"Jokin Pascual","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b63bca2b0abc8c4d523c8e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marga Gutiérrez","original_name":"Marga Gutiérrez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e956942cca6fc8fbc6be43","department":"Production","job":"Head of Production"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4678434,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carmen Ruiz de Temiño","original_name":"Carmen Ruiz de Temiño","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e956aeb5997a0261e53360","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Production Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jYlnkSR1qdh0uGiix14zdPxyZnQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Copenhagen International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2025-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
