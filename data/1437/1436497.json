After the occupation of France by German forces in 1940, he was sent as a laborer to a war factory in the city of Halle, Germany, where he joined the resistance movement. He was soon arrested and held in five different prisons and four concentration camps. Miraculously, he survived the Nazi concentration camps and became a Catholic priest in 1951. In Estonia and Finland, he was the only one engaged in exorcism.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/3KTYUuNH3fcQAVgGuKWzRFTIUlj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinoport Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2018-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father Guy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3844701,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eero Talvistu","original_name":"Eero Talvistu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b501f101820bf8af58346e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andri Luup","original_name":"Andri Luup","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/mypTVLNjUJR6DdY5KKiPOz2k9WC.jpg","credit_id":"67b501fe0c304c83453433e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andri Luup","original_name":"Andri Luup","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/mypTVLNjUJR6DdY5KKiPOz2k9WC.jpg","credit_id":"67b50208038242713756615e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andri Luup","original_name":"Andri Luup","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/mypTVLNjUJR6DdY5KKiPOz2k9WC.jpg","credit_id":"67b5021301820bf8af583479","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3805172,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Runno Tamra","original_name":"Runno Tamra","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5021e0382427137566167","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andri Luup","original_name":"Andri Luup","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/mypTVLNjUJR6DdY5KKiPOz2k9WC.jpg","credit_id":"67b502285e3e4076cc58378c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595700,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Lauri Laasik","original_name":"Lauri Laasik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/r9grPeoiCDc3cNqk1MPBMfbEOaK.jpg","credit_id":"67b50232d438ba214e343787","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/3KTYUuNH3fcQAVgGuKWzRFTIUlj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
