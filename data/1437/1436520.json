The film explores the psyche of the painter through her paintings, through interviews, through an interpretive commentary by the director of the film, and the improvised riffs of a saxophone soloist. The film is a scrapbook of ideas, memories, opinions, interpretations and paintings that render the artist eventful rather than biographical. Beyond the Sun reveals a character very much attracted to primitive religion and a painter drawn to colour abstraction, both qualities typical of the 'beat' movement of the 1940s and 50s.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5255561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Peterson","original_name":"Margaret Peterson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b5088f36c3282d53583702","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5255567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Therrien","original_name":"Rick Therrien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67b509f023664282c034323c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5255567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Therrien","original_name":"Rick Therrien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b508fa36c3282d535837a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5255567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Therrien","original_name":"Rick Therrien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b509308a003b233d343454","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985212,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Per Asplund","original_name":"Per Asplund","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b5095836c3282d535837e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
