Stripped of their past identities, they are trained to speak only in Esperanto, preparing them for adoption into new families. Eleven-year-old Joshua stands out as a nonconformist, defying the rigid norms by befriending a newcomer, Ĉiela. His bond with her stirs jealousy among the other children, especially from Pipro, the group’s eldest and self-appointed leader.  When Joshua is selected for adoption, he makes a daring choice to refuse it, unwilling to leave Ĉiela behind. This defiance provokes Pipro’s wrath, who manipulates the group into turning against the pair. Isolated and under increasing pressure to conform, Joshua and Ĉiela face a critical decision: surrender to the oppressive society or resist and fight for their freedom.","popularity":0.3377,"poster_path":"/hBtPsgThRynCTy1pUjnoZOK58Jq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
