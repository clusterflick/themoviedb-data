The question is: what can you see and what can't you? The sun is too bright to look into, while its reflection on the water is soft. A light source and its reflection are the same, but also different. Eyes, a face, sources of light, hands and what is intangible are combined with poetic words in this short experimental film. The first sight – over soft water – reflects hard light.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules van Hulst","original_name":"Jules van Hulst","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4b1a820b8dc549ae0c3ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
