Forêt follows a new generation of Rosas dancers moving amidst these artworks, bridging past and present.  Choreographed by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and Némo Flouret in 2022, the performance was designed for the Louvre’s Grande Galerie and its famed 'red rooms,' home to Italian masterpieces and 19th-century French Romantic art. Evi Cats captured this performance, with a camera that moves almost imperceptibly between the dancers and the audience, alternating between intimate close-ups and wide shots of the imposing scenery.","popularity":0.0805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forêt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183882,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anne
