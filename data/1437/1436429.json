A diverse group of older people far over 65 re-perform stereotypical film scenes about older age: scenes of poor health, lack of mental sharpness and sexual invisibility. But do these cinematic images really correspond to their own reality? This documentary emphasizes that there is a need to challenge the dominant 'gaze of youth' and accept more multi-layered perspectives about later life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not My Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astra Zoldnere","original_name":"Astra Zoldnere","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fBveUbTQOmnZVizk3VMS4kIAM5H.jpg","credit_id":"67b4d637d44dcafe0f9fbafe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890508,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ron Rosenberg","original_name":"Ron Rosenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4d64d2f5de15573e0e743","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2154918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Urte Alfs","original_name":"Urte Alfs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4d6cd4e89ccd7886e2b66","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713653,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Obermaier","original_name":"Christian Obermaier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4d6f291d7e66c656de174","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andris Indāns","original_name":"Andris Indāns","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4d7092f5de15573e0e786","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
