An active member of many feminist film co-operatives, her works explore Australian identity and feminism, excavating the effects of Australia’s colonial past through playful, innovative and experimental films. In Low deposit, easy terms, Ford interrogates Australia’s obsession with car culture, but instead of open Outback roads, the viewer tours inner-city car dealerships, home garages and junkyards where life struggles to grow. — ACMI","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uw7hkpCqZ0X7fjOEO6Nk2lyz4sx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Low Deposit, Easy Terms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue Ford","original_name":"Sue Ford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3d9673d43e000fe277e12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uw7hkpCqZ0X7fjOEO6Nk2lyz4sx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
