These moments illustrate their motivation behind why they took up the sport in the first place. One fighter deals with homophobia from her mother while the other suffers from her father’s constant psychological abuse. This is a story of redemption. Second chances reunite the fighters with their parents. No one is perfect and we cannot expect parents to do the right thing every time. They come with their own complexities from their unique perspectives. Family is permanent and it’s okay to have conflict, that is how we grow.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/nmNOiMXzv0e2LeJL19KqWsiyddF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roll Pin Punch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2494072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxine Eloi","original_name":"Maxine Eloi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pz79Oe0MY25G44eANNOCBPp0v6T.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3418d1f3319011d1672f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Elizabeth","original_name":"Anna Elizabeth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64f34194e0ca7f00ae3a31fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arischa Tones","original_name":"Arischa Tones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64f341a21f331900c6f5b82c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Martin","original_name":"Christopher Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64f341b074507d011c1efe8e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariana Baerga","original_name":"Ariana Baerga","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64f341b71f331900c6f5b83d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debbie Vu","original_name":"Debbie Vu","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f341765f2b8d00abca3c97","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debbie Vu","original_name":"Debbie Vu","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3417d77d23b00cb87223a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4077139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debbie Vu","original_name":"Debbie Vu","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f341705f2b8d011b4df003","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nmNOiMXzv0e2LeJL19KqWsiyddF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
