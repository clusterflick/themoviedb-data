From the Santa Barbara Fiestas and South Carolina's kitschy \"South of the Border\" tourist complex, to a Mexican Beatles cover band and Chicano rap, this film reveals the borderlands as a laboratory of hybridity that continues to ignite the popular imagination of each nation. Working at the boundaries of experimental film and documentary travelogue, this film weaves together found footage, interviews, performance art, and music video, producing a masterful commentary that is at once poetic, disturbing and hilarious. Includes appearances by Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Aztlán Underground, among others.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tVCKjcytZOXA1Mz8nMIlexY0972.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fideicomiso Para la Cultura Mexico-Estados
