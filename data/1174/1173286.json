Suddenly, “el corralito” appears and, despite a law approved in Congress, the Government does not respect it and negotiates with the money from savers. Given this, the photographer surrounds his body with sticks of dynamite, goes to the bank where he has his $150,000 and threatens to blow up everyone who is there if they don't give him theirs. When he is released from prison, he flees and seeks refuge where he was born and raised 35 years ago. There he meets his best friend, who helps him defend his life.","popularity":0.1677,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Emboscada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1915412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osvaldo Laport","original_name":"Osvaldo Laport","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/vc5BwNb03S0xpwzhiB8JkJoHIkv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3f9297d41aa011b88cdc1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":618344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roly Serrano","original_name":"Roly Serrano","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/wZHeM2vagjGaFMRwdpffAHRVVOA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3f92f5f2b8d00abca8434","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Kutika","original_name":"Silvia Kutika","popularity":0.1486,"profile_path":"/2HJbFgOyftUUnOhbs0XVUsWEYba.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3f93597a4e600feaa04c6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika de Sautu Arrieta","original_name":"Erika de Sautu Arrieta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3f93b97a4e6011bb0e471","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3158712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Bufali","original_name":"Andrés Bufali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3f91e97a4e600e1a44d91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
