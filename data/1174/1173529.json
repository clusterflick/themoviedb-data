They make their best to fit in and fulfill their roles but struggle to connect with the world, themselves and others. Something important is missing. As if the whole world was drained of love, chugging along on mere duties and bureaucratic inertia, passing over the baggage of the generations.  Giant’s Kettle is a journey into the unconscious, a love story without love, an epic tragicomedy of the mundane, and a mystery in a world emptied of mystery.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":"/gKJdgUPFs45o3Zz1l4PyQ2s1foW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hakala+Käki","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
