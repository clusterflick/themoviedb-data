It’s a selection that covers those early days when Fun Boy Three first introduced pop fans to the original line-up of Keren Woodward, Sara Dallin and Siobhan Fahey, as well as the end of the 1980s when Siobhan left and was replaced by Jacquie O’Sullivan.  We also bring things right up to date and feature the band’s current status as a duo, with Sara and Keren keeping the flame alive. Over all those years, Bananarama have never claimed to be the greatest singers or dancers, but together they somehow still created pop magic – so fans, settle back and witness how their durability proves beyond doubt that It Ain’t What You Do, it’s the Way That You Do It.","popularity":0.5015,"poster_path":"/MKPp5ERQCjGdlamZKBKxcr3kw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104151,"logo_path":"/tEMOnfOGQsTacV6dbrLsbc4F7yn.png","name":"BBC Music","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bananarama at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siobhan Fahey","original_name":"Siobhan Fahey","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/jGvu7JzahJxUcm2U6LEQQBdhjOr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64f76a328e20c50cd629d756","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2025359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keren Woodward","original_name":"Keren Woodward","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/vKMQ6qA6HWS62rlfa98ON2KGnFh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64f76a3df29d663563e9f106","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2305193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Dallin","original_name":"Sara Dallin","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/mKaRy2i73j2UR6eHFc4chbQPaig.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64f76a5c8e20c50cd629d75e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2025361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacquie O'Sullivan","original_name":"Jacquie O'Sullivan","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/yMqFLRX7WMwuhxixoHVzrQlM4dG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64f76a68a8b2ca011b890e55","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3160045,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shelley Talton","original_name":"Shelley Talton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f76a8ee0ca7f010de6885f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9hN54s4AxH7tiMt5AAvlO5XhS5d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ixcjayeJ9tV9JmjVF6nZJFupuwD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":953,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/MKPp5ERQCjGdlamZKBKxcr3kw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":635},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/71UsXS1aIrF2gS0nLejnM24RHkU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bananarama at the BBC - BBC Two - 02.09.23","key":"S_7Jad4qQMY","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-03T17:57:16.000Z","id":"66599f46490f2235251d4a14"}]}}}
