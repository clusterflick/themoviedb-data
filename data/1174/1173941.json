Grappling with frustrating gaps in the historical record, Schama assumes the role of a time-travelling detective who takes an unusual step for an historian and imagines how certain scenes and encounters might have played out. \"Maybe I thought what I was after was not a literal documentary truth,\" Schama tells us, \"but a poetic truth — an imaginative truth — and for that I was going to have to become my own Resurrection man. I was going to have to make these characters live again.\"","popularity":0.3184,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Experience: Murder at Harvard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Schama","original_name":"Simon Schama","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/rKtJWCsJDZjdyvuW78IKkwdhC1H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f5f7a63d43e038923aceb3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Stange","original_name":"Eric Stange","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f5f74d12197e00c449326c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253232,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melissa Banta","original_name":"Melissa Banta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f5f76cf29d66013a21e3b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Stange","original_name":"Eric Stange","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f5f792e0ca7f012eb4a206","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0416343","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
