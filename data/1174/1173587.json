It was Russia's Northern outpost a few centuries ago. Later it was destroyed and abolished, and now it is being restored. The brethren of this monastery is small: 4 hieromonks and 2 monks. They are young, and every one of them has had his personal way to monastic ordination. All their life stories are nontrivial and even paradoxical. They are attempting not only to restore the buildings of the monastery but to build a temple in their hearts. The film features unique footage of the inner life of the monastery.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/vehADdg4nTyEnhOjQsc2qBRly7N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brethren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4251746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olesia Buryachenko","original_name":"Olesia Buryachenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f4eba75f2b8d00e12c32e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2037962,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Amirdzhanov","original_name":"Sergey Amirdzhanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f4ebebe0ca7f00ae3abc1b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pavel Karmanov","original_name":"Павел Карманов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f4ec057d41aa00c489f475","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vehADdg4nTyEnhOjQsc2qBRly7N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":552}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
