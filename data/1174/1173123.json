The film, drawn and directed by Ib Steinaa, has as a common theme happy and playful children. As it is a fact that fewer and fewer people write actual Christmas cards, the film shows that there are other ways to use the Christmas stamp, and you get the opportunity to revisit many of previous years' Christmas stamps.","popularity":0.0532,"poster_path":"/p5HSHB55URuvi5ZgypHfuMnE8bs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1964-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julemærket 1964","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4244012,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Poul Dupont","original_name":"Poul Dupont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f371915f2b8d0139ce1d08","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565829,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ib Steinaa","original_name":"Ib Steinaa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3719c77d23b012e8b0913","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4244011,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walther Lehmann","original_name":"Walther Lehmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f371a8e0ca7f00ae3a3f5a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565829,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ib Steinaa","original_name":"Ib Steinaa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f371b374507d00e2ba92b2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565829,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ib Steinaa","original_name":"Ib Steinaa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3717fcaa50800c88836cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565829,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ib Steinaa","original_name":"Ib Steinaa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f371861f331900c6f5c5b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0297219","wikidata_id":"Q73482018","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p5HSHB55URuvi5ZgypHfuMnE8bs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":998}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1964-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
