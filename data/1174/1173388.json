Logically the fable of Mikhail Glinka (from a poem of Pushkin), symbol of the Russian opera, opened the season 2011-2012 of the majestic Moscow s opera, after its long renovation. This reopening inspired the director Dmitri Tcherniakov, who signed the direction of this new production. The new devices of the Bolshoi Theatre and its two giant screens are fully exploited in a spectacular staging. Tcherniakov transposes Glinka s opera at the 21th century with contemporary ambitions because of the \"modernity of the subject\", trying there to put forward \"the deep feelings of the characters , exposing the protagonists to very modern temptations: a \"harem\" for Ruslan, a Thai massage for Lyudmila.","popularity":0.2833,"poster_path":"/wylngcnYj1k0HQwVKxGoYeSH4pW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179295,"logo_path":"/beF0jVLbIPewobC4FpyY7co7TPu.png","name":"BelAir
