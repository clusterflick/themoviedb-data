История Алексея Германа и его фильмов","overview":"A story about the creative biography of Alexei German Sr. through the prism of his latest film - It's Hard to Be a God. Many shots from the shooting are published for the first time. Herman did not belong to any school or direction of cinema. Working on his films, he turned to the images of Brueghel and Bosch.
