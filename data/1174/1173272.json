For more than 15 years the school has changed the lives of more than 400 men and women chefs, giving them a profession that has lifted them out of their destitution while filling their lives with dreams, thus forging a new generation of Peruvian cooks. This documentary follows the case of three young alumi from the school, who now enjoy success in different parts of the world. In San Francisco, what started as work experience earned Jhosmery the position of pastry chef in a reputed Peruvian restaurant. In Luxembourg, Gerson takes up the reins of a kitchen with modernist ambitions. And in Lima, Alan runs a successful ceviche business. All saw gastronomy as a chance to get ahead.","popularity":0.1292,"poster_path":"/5ptkWE36nX485bxXvRuulFE8RtI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pachacútec, The Improbable School","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Carranza","original_name":"Mariano Carranza","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3e007700bf700adee834b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4848796,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ale Vélez","original_name":"Ale Vélez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a211d00c0e5fe4b16fbcd0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055820,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elard Robles","original_name":"Elard Robles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a211ac4e561f58a0c83822","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Carranza","original_name":"Mariano Carranza","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a211b8ac556bd4f0023fb5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Carranza","original_name":"Mariano Carranza","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a211a24e52b3f5c86fbc66","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4848795,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karina Meier","original_name":"Karina Meier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a211c3e455b7e8af18e546","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ptkWE36nX485bxXvRuulFE8RtI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lima Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"28 FCL PUCP | Tráiler Pachacútec, la escuela improbable | Galas","key":"g3KEnuSLWXM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-07-16T22:37:43.000Z","id":"66a2118e49bc9e7daa18dd86"}]}}}
