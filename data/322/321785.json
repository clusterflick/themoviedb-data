He’s a popular magician in a posh Prague nightclub, whose act draws more applause than the strippers. He’s got an eye-catching assistant who is ready and willing to cuddle his frayed nerves whenever necessary. But he’s also got Sylvia on his neck: a pert, scatterbrained sister who forgets that a toss in the hay may just be worth a wedding ring. Things take a turn for the better – or worse? – when he discovers he possesses extra - let’s say, supernatural – powers that enable him to see into the future, hear music by rubbing his finger over a CD, and God knows what. The problem? Peter can’t control anything any more like he used to – neither his magic act, nor his love life, nor his sister’s latest erotic fantasy.","popularity":0.1469,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13587,"logo_path":"/e1xxYKGJ9WjnjvkAWDUwmwruuuG.png","name":"Ziegler Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Powers","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Powers -
