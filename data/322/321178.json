This forces his editor Claudia Wesskampe, who hates the Mediterranean on account of her absent Italian stepfather, to join Kai to finish the field work, as he's already dangerously close to her deadline. Friendly locals like padre Leo Muti and his flirtatious cousin Luca soon convert her to appreciate the country, its people and even her unraveled family history.","popularity":0.2615,"poster_path":"/32BR0PlqbLf03NrAKb3R32mpJhK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Sommer in Amalfi","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann-Kathrin Kramer","original_name":"Ann-Kathrin Kramer","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/kcZNmkiD3J7CP792iNvelRE33av.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Claudia Wesskampe","credit_id":"54c6028e92514124320097c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Leal","original_name":"Carlos Leal","popularity":0.2848,"profile_path":"/fTAQuYmGJygoUZgn1SWIA7Un7Gq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Luca","credit_id":"54c60295c3a368792c008b74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffen Groth","original_name":"Steffen Groth","popularity":0.2879,"profile_path":"/aCnDc7h32pjENQiJJULLyc0VJ0d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kai","credit_id":"54c6029cc3a3682c3c00104d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armando Dotto","original_name":"Armando Dotto","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Padre Leo Muti","credit_id":"54c602a4c3a368792c008b78","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1418752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Nasemann","original_name":"Marie Nasemann","popularity":0.236,"profile_path":"/f2RV9OzuzUo8O3uO8KSD00kERpS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Caterina","credit_id":"54c602acc3a36823e3001b4b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Degen","original_name":"Carlo Degen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Paolo","credit_id":"5605c38fc3a3682929000836","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorgo Papavassiliou","original_name":"Jorgo Papavassiliou","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c602b89251412ece0033a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2784246","wikidata_id":"Q50733163","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tOoltKId4vH86p4mAv1HuiqecMf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7uzrHfl9RqSYD5iHCnZ3XxcnPrK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/32BR0PlqbLf03NrAKb3R32mpJhK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
