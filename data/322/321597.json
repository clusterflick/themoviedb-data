Alternately comic and tragic and anchored by an impressive ensemble cast, the film captures both the freedoms and the homophobia of the time – all set against the backdrop of small town America on Cape Cod.  British widower Harry Goodhart decides to make a fresh start and moves with his teenage daughters to Cape Cod in 1973. But Harry can't leave behind the secret that threatens to tear his family apart. Adjusting to their new lives proves difficult for the girls when they discover that the connection between their dad and his partner is more than just a working relationship.","popularity":2.8116,"poster_path":"/iJjAd9j7bUGcHp7d61YkT4Jhnkm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avery Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Family is family no matter what.","title":"Wild About Harry","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Primitive","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Once in a Very Blue Moon","type":"original script title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tate Donovan","original_name":"Tate Donovan","popularity":0.9848,"profile_path":"/uYgYbd842mtRY66Ehw441aKkOC5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"5596332392514152fd00018d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Pascal","original_name":"Adam Pascal","popularity":0.2081,"profile_path":"/fSX3Ywl96eeuKpxiORTPgW1wuwD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Theo","credit_id":"5596333192514152fd000190","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Savre","original_name":"Danielle Savre","popularity":0.9495,"profile_path":"/6N7FtcVfNqsx7PEj3JdNN4sOzX4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madeline Goodhart","credit_id":"5596335492514152fd000193","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skye McCole Bartusiak","original_name":"Skye McCole Bartusiak","popularity":0.558,"profile_path":"/PzzuSKm7fSjBI1sH0gWGqbyCZU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Daisy Goodhart","credit_id":"575099f7c3a36823d40004cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Peck","original_name":"Josh Peck","popularity":0.9569,"profile_path":"/qoapD8slSdb550o1JEoepv1SvT0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Spoke White","credit_id":"57509a0e9251413ed40004a2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Sevier","original_name":"Corey Sevier","popularity":0.7424,"profile_path":"/wKt1pHZ5Q6kgkmZsNz53lNPzLR3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"57509a209251413ed40004a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Anspach","original_name":"Susan Anspach","popularity":0.2578,"profile_path":"/o9PqTDLsktDUoaweBBLZj666G32.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Martha","credit_id":"57509a3d9251413ee1000449","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James B.
