In the early years of film, shots of visitors after a performance, churchgoers after a service, or workers leaving the factory were a proven success.

These screenings attracted many curious viewers who enjoyed looking for images of themselves, of relatives, or acquaintances.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/p7Upg2BvaKmkU6QhsiwTLx75rkM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandsche Biograaf en Mutoscope Maatschappij","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1899-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Children's Fair in the Circus Carré, 13 September","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"After the Children's Screening in the Circus Carré, 13, September","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Audience Leaving Circus Carré After the Biograph Show in Amsterdam","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The American Biograph in Circus O.
