And sometimes, the reality of life can seem unbearable. But we can rest in the knowledge that God loves us, He weeps in our times of pain, and He can be glorified through suffering. Narrated by Dr. James Dobson, Hope for Hurting Hearts tells the stories of how Greg and Cathe Laurie, Jeremy Camp, Nick Vujicic, and their families dealt with times of trial. Each of these individuals has stood at a 'spiritual crossroads' marked by challenging and painful circumstances, and each has chosen the road of trusting, following, and glorifying God.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope for Hurting Hearts","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2858223,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ken Sanders","original_name":"Ken Sanders","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605363e71092300099db87c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099387,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Troy Lamberth","original_name":"Troy Lamberth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60536412a1d332009da661c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dwight Thompson","original_name":"Dwight Thompson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8dc9b4f8aee80035bd952d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3089436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
