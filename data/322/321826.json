While canned Muzak plays, a scrolling text denounces the corporate masquerade of commercial television to reveal the structure of profit that greases the wheels of the media industry. Television emerges as little more than a insidious sponsor for the corporate engines of the world. By appropriating the medium he is criticizing—using television, in effect, against itself—Serra employs a characteristic strategy of early, counter-corporate video collectives—a strategy that remains integral to video artists committed to a critical dismantling of the media’s political and ideological stranglehold.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Television Delivers People","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Serra","original_name":"Richard Serra","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/aIKTeQv73Jhzz8qnK7Ap0GL7JYm.jpg","credit_id":"54c9025dc3a3687a6500185c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1419831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlota Fay Schoolman","original_name":"Carlota Fay Schoolman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c9027f925141678e0063c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5223490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
