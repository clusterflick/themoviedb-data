Director Amy Berg explored Joplin's story in depth. A portrait of a complicated, driven and often beleaguered artist. Joplin's own words recount a series of letters she wrote to her family over the years. Janis was a vessel of energy when she sang. Her rapid rise and untimely death changed music forever.","popularity":1.6257,"poster_path":"/qosDLnAcHRAUjgmZIU0c1ktEhx2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2740,"logo_path":"/gSiDWkmEOyOn9MsaCgnjd8Mohmx.png","name":"Jigsaw Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Disarming Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":99614,"logo_path":"/gXrb4q4TqBHCYEvjRa16WOE9NRs.png","name":"American Masters Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21775,"logo_path":null,"name":"Union Entertainment Group","origin_country":""},{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Janis: Little Girl Blue","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":159,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Janis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janis Joplin","original_name":"Janis Joplin","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/hMYnBrk5Gar4THBjoWwQ5SHXItK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself (archive footage)","credit_id":"55d621c9c3a368137b000404","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cat Power","original_name":"Cat Power","popularity":0.1841,"profile_path":"/wXUHm4VaEr6yVOGbzj2zzozW5dd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"55d620d89251414feb00035c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
