He whiles away his days in a chair in the house of his son and daughter-in-law. He has to see how his adulterous daughter-in-law plots to murder her two foster children and her husband. Jean-Marie can't intervene and because he can't talk he can't warn his own family. Misfortune, tragic developments, and a fatal ending dominated many of the early Dutch fiction films.","popularity":0.054,"poster_path":"/vEOeJTKr5UgBFUAjZyKeJD9iOiC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Fabriek Anton Nöggerath","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1909-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grip","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Griffe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1402443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Bouwmeester","original_name":"Louis Bouwmeester","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/n2qC5mFQ101q9ynRsIVtv7kBrOd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jean-Marie Hardouin","credit_id":"54c8d518c3a3687a650013f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ko van Sprinkhuijsen","original_name":"Ko van Sprinkhuijsen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hippolyte","credit_id":"54c8d521c3a36874ac005cb9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mien de la Mar","original_name":"Mien de la Mar","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"54c8d529c3a3687006001d51","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raaf Bouwmeester","original_name":"Raaf Bouwmeester","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Emile","credit_id":"54c8d531c3a3687a650013fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frits Bouwmeester jr.","original_name":"Frits Bouwmeester jr.","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Etienne","credit_id":"54c8d539925141561e001f67","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léon Boedels","original_name":"Léon Boedels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c8d405925141561e001f46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"F.A.
