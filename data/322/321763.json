Despite having almost no audience, he consistently churns out 3-4 original feature-length films a year. He's made action movies, horror movies, westerns and more. He's not rich, he has no crew, no formal training and aside from his action figures, plays virtually every part.

Miller, a 50 year-old man who creates impossible blockbusters from his tiny studio apartment in Wichita, Kansas.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of a Neighborhood Movie Star","title":"Double Digits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":995557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Johnson","original_name":"Justin Johnson","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c8fb7ac3a3680924001a1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
