Costas and Anna in Athens. Costas is an engine driver. The trains he drives travel from one end of the city to the other, following the traces of the ancient rivers that were paved over and made into roads. Anna sells ferry boat tickets at Piraeus, the city’s main harbour, the place where the rivers once flowed into the sea. Costas knows Anna. He sees her every morning, waiting on the platform for his train to take her from Thiseion to Piraeus; and he sees her every afternoon, when his train takes her from Piraeus back to Thiseion. Anna doesn’t know Costas. From the window of the train car she looks out at the same desolate city every day, without knowing who’s driving the train. When something happens to turn Costas’s life upside down, he decides to reach out from inside his solitude and talk to Anna.","popularity":0.3453,"poster_path":"/btha6u1rZvDhy2MzbJWppX3EKow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19246,"logo_path":"/4zrEZfTf94tyG4wRB599gRS0reU.png","name":"Faliro House Productions","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":8940,"logo_path":"/rUoTXqWRNJ58b0UMbwMcPy0I8bi.png","name":"CL Productions","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2014-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forever","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gia Panta","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kostas Filippoglou","original_name":"Κώστας Φιλίππογλου","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/f9bGWLBWS31nLpE9aJSNPftEUkl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Κώστας","credit_id":"54c69f54c3a36874b4000059","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1418982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Mascha","original_name":"Άννα Μάσχα","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/pBDEV5rNnHH77YI13iw37rxfQQG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Άννα","credit_id":"54c69f5dc3a36874ae000044","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christos Dimas","original_name":"Χρήστος Δήμας","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/iMKgiTHFpLQEBOMauAqYuNYrbAi.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Γείτονας Άννας","credit_id":"6165c9c850733c008bdc0003","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agapitos Mandalios","original_name":"Agapitos Mandalios","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sxEORTyCND1sHBAvh9ZaFoR2erZ.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Ρακοσυλλέκτης","credit_id":"6165c98f9d592c002b5b5b25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Indares","original_name":"Δημήτρης Ινδαρές","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/lXH3P9u0nxE0vGDvbJi6vtiPnRC.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Γιατρός","credit_id":"6165c9e33a99370062a649da","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikos Dallas","original_name":"Νίκος Ντάλλας","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Σταθμάρχης","credit_id":"5739110e925141791700223d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1418980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margarita Manda","original_name":"Μαργαρίτα Μαντά","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yvxLSMbMmVovTheoYDKS4PyhFlY.jpg","credit_id":"54c69e799251416791000047","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1418980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margarita Manda","original_name":"Μαργαρίτα Μαντά","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yvxLSMbMmVovTheoYDKS4PyhFlY.jpg","credit_id":"54c69e5dc3a36874b0000034","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kostas Kefalas","original_name":"Κώστας Κεφάλας","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5739105fc3a3684db4001749","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1620685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnes Sklavos","original_name":"Ανιές Σκλάβου","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/dube3KzZ5c9jJyA5M2Mr2CA1yYX.jpg","credit_id":"57391051c3a3685aa400235f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313871,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kostas Gikas","original_name":"Κωστής Γκίκας","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5739104292514111a8000e9a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1620688,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Effie Skrobolas","original_name":"Έφη Σκρόμπολα","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57391093c3a3686bfb000887","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1620690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dimitris Hatzivogiatzis","original_name":"Δημήτρης Χατζηβογιατζής","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573910a7c3a3685aa4002384","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007616,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christos V.
