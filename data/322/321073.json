In ABC - We print anything - In the cards (1977) Schneemann documented dreams, advice and conversations relating to her shifting relationships. She collated 315 numbered cards, containing both text and photographic imagery, which she photographed from her domestic life. Schneemann (the ‘C’ in ABC) analyses her complex set of experiences separating from ‘A’ (artist Anthony McCall) while drawing closer to ‘B’ (publisher Bruce McPherson). The cards capture the dynamic, paradoxical, humorous and contrary aspects of relationships, forming an intimate yet measured set of information.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/fJb0N6RSNZ00jF7YNRTNGRtOS25.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1977-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ABC - We Print Anything - In the Cards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolee Schneemann","original_name":"Carolee Schneemann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/1J4OvAVVJpgI3NzLSAzn2WQBYTN.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"54c4f2d1c3a3684a1f00159e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony McCall","original_name":"Anthony McCall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/caVwYIj8hNRnmBHUu3nJG9rU3YP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54c4f2dac3a3684a1f0015a1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolee Schneemann","original_name":"Carolee Schneemann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/1J4OvAVVJpgI3NzLSAzn2WQBYTN.jpg","credit_id":"54c4f2ea9251412489007d30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fJb0N6RSNZ00jF7YNRTNGRtOS25.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
