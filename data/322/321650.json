Continuously fired from minimum wage employment, Blake and his best friend Elliot get sucked into the dangerous world of gambling. Luckily, Blake's sister Angela has proven to be a reliable roommate and so far taken care of her irresponsible younger brother. When a car crash on the way to a job interview lands her in the hospital, Blake offers to start the job in his sister's place, which turns out to be more complicated than expected: His ward is the homely and socially inept 20-year-old agoraphobic Giselle, who insists on a *female* assistant. However, the girl and her mother have never met Angela in person, and thus Blake is able to transform himself into a convincingly enough version of his sister.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/kDZ3XIlv3a0Mbd8pLKOPjMUZdzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Falling in love is a drag.","title":"Grooming Giselle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Koelsch","original_name":"Clark Koelsch","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":"/u5CidHZCewLhAZM11cK1wzn16NJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Blake","credit_id":"54c8006dc3a36874bf0049b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1419340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Hill","original_name":"Jamie Hill","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/mbnllMOAywP5FmiQ1A2TWCyK82F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giselle Summers","credit_id":"54c8010b9251416794004831","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Giddings","original_name":"Justin Giddings","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/7KiaDdJSFGJ6BQb1pvEhTTd0ZNb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elliot","credit_id":"54c80118c3a368700600072f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Lyndon","original_name":"Amy Lyndon","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/YMD1fsL0H1eZxTk7givJcx1lvy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Susanna","credit_id":"54c80123925141678c00497c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Masina","original_name":"Victoria Masina","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Aurora Summers","credit_id":"54c80131c3a36874ac0047a3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Oberst Jr.","original_name":"Bill Oberst Jr.","popularity":0.3082,"profile_path":"/m8XSyHqKGxOWXZaLpyapFfu2PJx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lenny","credit_id":"61ddac53c175b200664bac97","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Smith","original_name":"Chris Smith","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/px6U02IgLpNT68JqRLFSEVMHGTY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"61ddac5a6743fa0068d438f8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4165034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kammy Burnett","original_name":"Kammy Burnett","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/mMYlPBfUjDLITmva516Bt47qjDV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Victoria","credit_id":"64b37a6be0ca7f01253d6018","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2005897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merit Leighton","original_name":"Merit Leighton","popularity":0.1981,"profile_path":"/1GqGxUTJWnobp36bms3iDYc2b0A.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"67cda5872794b0d5982a7cd4","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Masina","original_name":"Victoria Masina","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c8015d92514167870047a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419338,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Cohen","original_name":"Kate Cohen","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c8001b92514157cc00073f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419338,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Cohen","original_name":"Kate Cohen","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c800319251416794004828","department":"Production","job":"Casting"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1670991","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kDZ3XIlv3a0Mbd8pLKOPjMUZdzG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":988}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
