Weiley's film was controversial; it was screened once and then he was told it had been destroyed. Forty five years later a copy was discovered in the BBC vaults by an ABC producer looking for archive footage of the Opera House. Weiley was contacted and told about a film that had no sound track. Weiley was overjoyed; for years he had kept the original sound. So began the painstaking process of restoring this record of a unique moment in Australian culture to its former glory, complete with updated voice-over from the original narrator, Bob Ellis. It is set in context by a 30 minute prologue entitled 'The Dream of Perfection'. Made by the same filmmaker, John Weiley, forty-five years on, 'Dream of Perfection' tells the story of the 1968 film - from commission to destruction, to surprise resurrection.","popularity":0.7468,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75638,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABC Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":41577,"logo_path":"/6tkgqMVglDM5XFY1DWXVEQ4WZvV.png","name":"Felix Media","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autopsy on a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Ellis","original_name":"Bob Ellis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57135e0e92514131740047b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":295713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Weiley","original_name":"John Weiley","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57cab3e4925141357d001e48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Utzon","original_name":"Jan Utzon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57135edfc3a36831e100a062","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lin Utzon","original_name":"Lin Utzon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57135f0ec3a36866780077f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorn Utzon","original_name":"Jorn Utzon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57135f27925141522e001397","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard le Plaistrier","original_name":"Richard le Plaistrier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5713604ac3a36860a800b939","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Attenborough","original_name":"David Attenborough","popularity":1.4236,"profile_path":"/tt3LW3XftcvxOZtMXmIaJSWFN7y.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5713606e9251414a7100149b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Maynard","original_name":"John Maynard","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/tbXr1C4PQ189SrVmCURDrhE4RpV.jpg","credit_id":"57135c23c3a368412200bc32","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1606953,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Donna Chang","original_name":"Donna Chang","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57135c3f9251415203001366","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":295713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Weiley","original_name":"John Weiley","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cab3d6c3a3685a5300271d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":295713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Weiley","original_name":"John Weiley","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cab3c19251411a9900285a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3279708","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"MA15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Autopsy On a Dream: Trailer (ABC1)","key":"oSkJpRpB7iQ","published_at":"2013-10-15T04:16:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"57135a28c3a368537800dabc"}]}}}
