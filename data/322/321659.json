In the year 334 B.C., 20-year-old King Alexander of Macedonia decided to bring the farthest reaches of the world under one domain. Over the next 12 years, he led a grand army across more than 20,000 miles and eventually brought all of Asia under his control, only to perish from battle wounds at the age of 32. Incorporating dramatic onsite reenactments with high-end computer graphics and the expertise of renowned scholars, THE TRUE STORY OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT is special presentation from THE HISTORY CHANNELÂ®, examining the life and career of this military genius, impassioned lover, and fearless leader. Hosted by Peter Woodward (Conquest), this definitive program is available on DVD for the first time.","popularity":0.6835,"poster_path":"/dNKDlhL26YBgReUSFKvparwEBqu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greystone Communications","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"},{"id":106324,"logo_path":"/s3zNiYR6gmjGjI7fphaym7WuNLy.png","name":"A+E Global Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The True Story of Alexander the Great","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Cardelle","original_name":"Michael Cardelle","popularity":0.2189,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alexander","credit_id":"5c1d3cf4c3a368700be87a01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856195,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frantz Widmaier","original_name":"Frantz Widmaier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hephaestion","credit_id":"6191b5dab7b69d0044ab8f5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Woodward","original_name":"Peter Woodward","popularity":0.3849,"profile_path":"/ex9oL4IfruXTfNCq7MOn1Z87cPK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self (host)","credit_id":"6191b57a15376c00610b0854","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":170955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Ferrer","original_name":"Rafael Ferrer","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6191b59af85958008fc54403","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Lindsay","original_name":"Jim Lindsay","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6191b650c4ad59002bc34f1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0455818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nCUN0kxlP9hqCJhWVjicMUL4G2G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/maauy0sLiCuIVUiQutJEDnpWRPe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jvhGDzGVIiy071HMWfqOk06HQkL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2136,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dNKDlhL26YBgReUSFKvparwEBqu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1424}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
