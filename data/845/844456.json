The film’s material comes from video recordings of the Villager Documentary Project from 2005-2009. It is about how these complete strangers and I became tied, bound, and rolled up together. And it’s about the phrase I keep wanting to shout to them,“Stand your ground! None of you run from this!”","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/nwjot1Eol05L3BGbE0ej5RWpoqj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bare Your Stuff","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Wenguang","original_name":"Wu Wenguang","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/hqkDZppHlSTxXeaSUBua6mzuAFn.jpg","credit_id":"60d4943dc390c5002f9edc01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nwjot1Eol05L3BGbE0ej5RWpoqj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
