With a prognosis  of less than 6 months to live, he urgently sets out to document for his children  who he is, what he has achieved and what has given his life meaning. With his twins less than one year old, his motivation to survive is intense as he battles with hope and pragmatism in his final months. What matters most in life is crystallised as he faces everything he has to lose. As universal as death is, it is  only when staring into its face, that the meaning of life becomes apparent.","popularity":0.0792,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78312,"logo_path":"/GeitJmP7I3SxLy79IoaUJbv4Le.png","name":"Looking Glass Pictures","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jez: A Letter for Life","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Spinak","original_name":"Jeremy Spinak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d5967e33ad8f007f7f2240","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638146,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitzi Goldman","original_name":"Mitzi Goldman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d59691aa7898005d4e3436","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638146,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitzi Goldman","original_name":"Mitzi Goldman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d596b17aecc6007eef7010","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26050,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Gross","original_name":"Guy Gross","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64669602006b010147e8e5c0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12861976","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Jezaletterforlife","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
