The Huddle tells the stories of two Irish communities brought together by a devotion to the Celtic Football Club, and a shared faith in football. Exploring the contradictions between two cities facing radical ideological divides yet brought together by full stadiums, these are the interwoven and personal accounts of journalists, musicians, political militants, IRA fighters-all united by their love of football-on what it means to be Irish.","popularity":0.0736,"poster_path":"/op7CHoudnzaB2qa9VGeIFXgCBjO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Point Nemo","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":156384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berenice Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Huddle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068801,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommaso Barbaro","original_name":"Tommaso Barbaro","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d60a6933ad8f007f80192c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Clerici","original_name":"Francesco Clerici","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d60b1a880551005d5fb219","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15417594","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/plfqrE6VWsPGfN5JZN0w3X6fKl9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/op7CHoudnzaB2qa9VGeIFXgCBjO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
