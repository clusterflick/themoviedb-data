As  one  of Hollywood’s most  enigmatic f igures,  Farrow  was the  director  of some 50 films; a sailor,  a poet,  a  war hero,  best-selling author, a religious scholar,  a family man and a philanderer  – a man  who lived many lives  –  yet  who left behind no memoirs,  no interviews and no archival footage  – and  who today is  only a shadow in the pages  of film history.","popularity":0.4592,"poster_path":"/7dmi9a4wErACY8lcTqM3Zv2SutB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156336,"logo_path":null,"name":"Third Street Steps Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Farrow: Hollywood’s Man in the Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Pomeranz","original_name":"Margaret Pomeranz","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/wKLSFpnRJbEKcYX752RjU2fLLX0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d4f1f6ce4ddc0073d0d895","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1758569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Stratton","original_name":"David Stratton","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/xGHhnAbLYWIc1zaurmTzTJg3p9T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d4f204c390c5005d8db62e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Noyce","original_name":"Phillip Noyce","popularity":0.6642,"profile_path":"/t41FK8X4egnSLNDexVUZ5yGq3XB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d4f2840f2fbd005f617b14","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Mora","original_name":"Philippe Mora","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/aT8heTidkrxWn2Vl3SsGi89RsLe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d4f2c0c390c500469d169f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Gonzalez","original_name":"Claude Gonzalez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f22951a64e004714154d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486566,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frans Vandenburg","original_name":"Frans Vandenburg","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f25138469a00744d04bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Gonzalez","original_name":"Claude Gonzalez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f2dfce4ddc0073d0dbc6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486566,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frans Vandenburg","original_name":"Frans Vandenburg","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f2ee9f1be70046572a00","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027506,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Petty","original_name":"Sam Petty","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f3053c887d0076f17f68","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027506,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Petty","original_name":"Sam Petty","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f3213c887d0076f17f9d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388841,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Susan Lumsdon","original_name":"Susan Lumsdon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f34163a69500465099ce","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135512,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antoinette Ford","original_name":"Antoinette Ford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f3673e6f2b005c313e8e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Walter McIntosh","original_name":"Walter McIntosh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d4f3ae3e6f2b00737b4d1a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14363730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7dmi9a4wErACY8lcTqM3Zv2SutB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":693}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12396,"name":"hollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
