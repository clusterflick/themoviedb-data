In modern day France, an exhibition is being held at the Palace of Versailles of the \"Necklace of Marie Antoinette\". The necklace had been used in a fraud case that marked a chapter in French history and later went missing. It has been reproduced using real diamonds.  Fujiko has sneaked into Versailles, as has the gang of Lupin, Goemon, and Jigen - all with the intention of getting their hands on the necklace, which is valued at over 3 billion yen in today's money. But they bump into Inspector Zenigata. Lupin is the one who manages to foil Zenigata and grab the necklace.  Yet the instant he lays hands on it, everyone is enveloped in a mysterious light.  When they regain consciousness, they notice they have gone through a time slip to 1785, before the French Revolution when Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were around.","popularity":0.6501,"poster_path":"/s1yeR8poGQY9kgXGXVMZLJzkuzh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue
