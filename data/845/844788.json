The city is divided overnight. Escape to the West becomes more dangerous every day. But on September 14, 1962, exactly one year, one month and one day after the Wall was built, a group of 29 people from the GDR managed to escape spectacularly through a 135-meter tunnel to the West. For more than 4 months, students from West Berlin, including 2 Italians, dug this tunnel.  When the tunnel builders ran out of money after only a few meters of digging, they came up with the idea of marketing the escape tunnel. They sell the film rights to the story exclusively to NBC, an American television station.","popularity":0.6383,"poster_path":"/v74GVhZ2KtlTetMNVKM7YMnPZ56.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmperspektive","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":158480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Addictive
