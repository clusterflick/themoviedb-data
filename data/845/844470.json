And when they moved out into the world at large, they brought what they learned along with them. I Really Get Into It: The Underage Architects of Sioux Falls Punk is a story about the tenacity and ingenuity of youth, finding and following your convictions, and how the kids you least expect often make the most noise. Shot on location in eight cities and assembled from dozens of hours of archival video and hundreds of photos, the documentary features interviews with Larry Livermore (Lookout. Records), Ian MacKaye (Fugazi), Mike Park (Skankin' Pickle), Rebecca Hanten (Cadillac Blindside), Terry Taylor (Hammerlord), and dozens of current and former members of the Sioux Falls all ages music scene.","popularity":0.5043,"poster_path":"/bmrQy0ZTsC1auBwXzBUGpcc4F9F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghosts & Horses Moving Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Underage Architects of Sioux Falls Punk","title":"I Really Get Into It: The Underage Architects of Sioux Falls Punk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacKaye","original_name":"Ian MacKaye","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/hWGVc8Ng7o6IxGCv7dDH9gZugF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"60d49cdd9f1be7004655dc74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Taylor","original_name":"Terry Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"60d49ce638469a002f77e236","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Livermore","original_name":"Larry Livermore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"60d49cf563a69500729db5d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Hanten","original_name":"Rebecca Hanten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"60d49d0038469a005ddbc355","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Kock","original_name":"Shawn Kock","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"60d49d0cc390c500469be3e7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian L Bieber","original_name":"Brian L Bieber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d49d329f1be7004655ddba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian L Bieber","original_name":"Brian L Bieber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d49d6dce4ddc002d79a65b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brienne Maner","original_name":"Brienne Maner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d49d7cce4ddc00451ba440","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Portz","original_name":"Walter Portz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d49d94ce4ddc002d79a6f8","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13556114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"IReallyGetIntoIt","instagram_id":"ireallygetintoit","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bmrQy0ZTsC1auBwXzBUGpcc4F9F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":158424,"name":"diy mentality"},{"id":185456,"name":"south dakota"},{"id":200243,"name":"diy culture"},{"id":217906,"name":"hardcore punk"},{"id":281918,"name":"sioux falls"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
