Everything changes when he suddenly loses his job, and other variables enter the fray. Henri inherits an adventure park from his brother – its peculiar employees and troubling financial problems included. Most pressing: big loans were taken from criminal elements, and the lenders are now keen to get their money back. In the adventure park, Henri also crosses paths with Laura, an artist with a checkered past. As the criminals begin to collect their debts and as Henri’s relationship with Laura deepens, he finds himself faced with situations and emotions that simply cannot be quantified on a spread sheet.","popularity":0.1831,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10227,"logo_path":"/3YfRy3DBl4abcqkzGx4RVNz12yl.png","name":"Mandeville Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"The Rabbit Factor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Carell","original_name":"Steve Carell","popularity":3.0979,"profile_path":"/dA6n0qpnlMFBlTr8SBULsZbWkvn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60d503939979d2005d545340","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3141682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antti Tuomainen","original_name":"Antti Tuomainen","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dc5405ef9d7200478a92a2","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3141682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antti Tuomainen","original_name":"Antti Tuomainen","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dc547db458b8007d00553c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14920734","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
