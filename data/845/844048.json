Christian shapeshifts between rock star, folklorist and high priestess as she conjures a constellation of souls in an effort to confront her family’s mythologies.  With raucous, ferocious music that fuses blues, gospel and folk, Heather Christian invites you to raise a glass to the unseen forces that shape our lives. Adapted from the stage production that had a sold-out and acclaimed run at The Bushwick Starr, Animal Wisdom offers a transporting experience where a concert becomes a mass, and a mass becomes a séance, all in your living room.","popularity":0.0989,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do you believe in ghosts?","title":"Animal Wisdom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1332262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heather Christian","original_name":"Heather Christian","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60d2e60b65e0a200747d708d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1332262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heather Christian","original_name":"Heather Christian","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d2e6d98d1b8e002cc6deab","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amber McGinnis","original_name":"Amber McGinnis","popularity":0.0622,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d2e71967b613007ddd20e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1332262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heather Christian","original_name":"Heather Christian","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d2e67a8d1b8e0046ed9732","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
