Since the summer protests, the real situation in the mines hardly changed; this lead to the second wave of miners' protests in 1990-91. This time, the miners' slogans include political demands, mentioning the decommunization of power and Ukraine's independence.

The miners meet the August coup and the final disintegration of the country of the Soviets in strike committees.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/6bFLfZ3sEwuZ1zgcJsPC2XN0TTo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ukrainian Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The July Storms.
