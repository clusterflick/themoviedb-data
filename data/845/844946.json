It is the effort to expose the heart through absence. Allowing the image to sharpen the senses to a past that still pulses in the present.

'Breath' is a snippet, it is the desire of hugging, of looking in the eyes, while relentlessly searching for air.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kVRSIlTdauidFbLpOox0bEuCZdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Badim","original_name":"Sofia Badim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d6650e99c96400467246fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kVRSIlTdauidFbLpOox0bEuCZdn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
