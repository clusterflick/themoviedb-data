Through a video work projected in one of the shadowy tunnels of the ex-convict structures at Cockatoo Island, this work questions the legitimacy of Kelly’s hero status through a modern reinterpretation of his moral persona. Thornton skews the national narrative rooted in the romance of a Western, by transforming Kelly into a “meth head robbing a 7 Eleven”, placing him in a banal (sub)urban delinquent realm, far removed from cult status. Commissioned by the Biennale of Sydney.","popularity":0.085,"poster_path":"/3Syf0syWr5jYYnzt2xZMYVPjJbz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meth Kelly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warwick Thornton","original_name":"Warwick Thornton","popularity":0.222,"profile_path":"/lbeXa9X4Pxf8FEy9ugXnspdMysG.jpg","credit_id":"5f465754efca000037b9db99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":1946,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Syf0syWr5jYYnzt2xZMYVPjJbz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1452}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
