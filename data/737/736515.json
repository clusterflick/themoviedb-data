It was screened at the Baralt Theatre in Maracaibo, Venezuela, on 28 January 1897. The film shows a group of young people, \"muchachos\", enjoying Lake Maracaibo. Not much is known about the film's production, and scholars question the identity of its director. Though more is known of the contents of this film than its pair Un célebre especialista..., it has not seen as much modern discussion as the latter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qPmuDN46HjPeNtvW8HykrajGv8W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1897-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muchachos bañándose en la laguna de Maracaibo","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2754333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Trujillo Durán","original_name":"Manuel Trujillo Durán","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vHLrUJhjplevi6iBZBYISlDqppe.jpg","credit_id":"5f45092e511d090038b6a9fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2332717","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qPmuDN46HjPeNtvW8HykrajGv8W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Teatro Baralt de Maracibo","release_date":"1897-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
