To Klein, the female figure was the canon of human proportion, an anthropometric symbol that he described as “the most concentrated expression of vital energy imaginable”. The same blue colour used by him (International Klein Blue IKB) is used by Marcy Petit as she becomes a human paintbrush too.","popularity":0.0605,"poster_path":"/bDUek4rUf9KaqWWx8aGAqbVLNxr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(IKB) - Body Print Into Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcy Petit","original_name":"Marcy Petit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f43e88f99d5c30033bda87a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDUek4rUf9KaqWWx8aGAqbVLNxr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
