Through the use of a remarkably complete set of documentary records, he explores one village - that of Codicote in Hertfordshire - looking at its boom times and its poorer times. Wood brings the period to life by focusing in on one family, that of the poor peasant Christina Cok, her father Hugh, her estranged husband William, and her children John and Alice. By looking at the poorest members of Codicote's society, Wood approaches his history from the bottom-up rather than taking the traditional historical approach of top-down, 'kings and barons' story-telling.","popularity":0.1559,"poster_path":"/ghK1ooRZeOlSWNLnpgN6bu8YuYR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christina: A Medieval Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wood","original_name":"Michael Wood","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/2OAsA80K3FUinxeXqdCn47o8hhC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"66b6fb33be78dad786f424a5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wood","original_name":"Michael Wood","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/2OAsA80K3FUinxeXqdCn47o8hhC.jpg","credit_id":"66b6fb5f0c5cb94fe0282cfd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Wallace","original_name":"David Wallace","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b6fb51638883df8bd7770f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1333069","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":905,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5fHdiwun8KPvMQPzUbhgBnpcLGX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":603},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ghK1ooRZeOlSWNLnpgN6bu8YuYR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
