Unheralded but unforgettable, Gauge left a significant impression on a whole scene of kids and bands, many of whom went on to bigger things, like Braid and Cap'n Jazz. After 15 years apart, Gauge reunited in 2010 for a few shows. This is a document of those shows as well as a tribute to a band that left an impact on many still felt today.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/72vToWL4Z61WFM5pur0Xi9y5TNm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gauge:153","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1727273","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/72vToWL4Z61WFM5pur0Xi9y5TNm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
