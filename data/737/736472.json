In many ways the film, which is both Picaresque and anti-heroic, was too far ahead of its time, and it is often considered the precursor to Monicelli’s L’armata brancaleone. This time out, Ferreri takes the reins as producer of the ill-fated undertaking (the two directors will never make another film); however, Donne e soldati, apart from marking Ferreri’s estrangement from Italian cinema for a number of years, today appears to display earthy and carnivalesque elements that will subsequently influence certain aspects of the Milanese director’s vision.","popularity":0.1435,"poster_path":"/9kX1V8mFm6MiCOY4QAhI3ez4XxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1955-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women and Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":224456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcella Mariani","original_name":"Marcella Mariani","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Margherita","credit_id":"5f46bfa5f6596f0040aa2994","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":999781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandro Somarè","original_name":"Sandro Somarè","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Storyteller","credit_id":"5f46bfbb7739410035e34496","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ferreri","original_name":"Marco Ferreri","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/afP3Hk6ys05jqh33q8nrmkELpZz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Landlord","credit_id":"5f46bfc3efca000034baee87","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152733,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luigi Malerba","original_name":"Luigi Malerba","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46bf76691cd50033bbe7ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152733,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luigi Malerba","original_name":"Luigi Malerba","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46bf44efca000035bc649c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460459,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonio Marchi","original_name":"Antonio Marchi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46bf8117c44300369d5a4b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460459,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonio Marchi","original_name":"Antonio Marchi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46bf2baf3da60035e710da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ferreri","original_name":"Marco Ferreri","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/afP3Hk6ys05jqh33q8nrmkELpZz.jpg","credit_id":"5f46bf59a8b2ca003786723e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Attilio Bertolucci","original_name":"Attilio Bertolucci","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46bf670d11f20031bcc3cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0046925","wikidata_id":"Q48814164","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9kX1V8mFm6MiCOY4QAhI3ez4XxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/eiU19WYuE6Pd51jUBHqnGcYFgsk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1955-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
