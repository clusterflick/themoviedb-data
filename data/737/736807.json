The story follows two rival high school teams focusing on five teens growing up on the Navajo and Hopi reservations â€” two distinct cultures but both richly steeped in the legacy of running as a powerful cultural tradition and a sport. Unfolding over two years of careful, patient observation, this documentary offers a rare view into the surprising complexity and diversity of contemporary reservation life, from the point of view of the young runners.","popularity":0.1858,"poster_path":"/kDVNufx4mYROU3N9JGhzhgAn05Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Racing the Rez","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900839,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Truglio","original_name":"Brian Truglio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46649ed0b4340036168ac0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900839,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Truglio","original_name":"Brian Truglio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b70362d7800f5358a40d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3256530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sean Sandefur","original_name":"Sean Sandefur","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b706d25fe505400706727","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2757458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kDVNufx4mYROU3N9JGhzhgAn05Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":10322,"name":"native american"},{"id":9524,"name":"navajo"},{"id":207948,"name":"cross country running"},{"id":264920,"name":"hopi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Racing the Rez Trailer","key":"aaXL7bUv1dc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-11-09T23:05:10.000Z","id":"5f466592a8b2ca0036868a9f"}]}}}
