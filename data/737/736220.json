Even though the police claimed Roach had commited suicide, evidence showed otherwise. Isaac Julien says that this work is essentially a response to the riots, an answer to certain fixed ways of looking at black cultures, but also at those ways we might feel about ourselves.","popularity":0.541,"poster_path":"/3RluMgdJJb0RDKFvgHJ8RsJz0NX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sankofa Film & Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Killed Colin Roach?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1468453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Zephaniah","original_name":"Benjamin Zephaniah","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/9Ea2PSL6Y3eZHLtMLaHSdxR7GpN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f43d39541a5610034d1c9ed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Julien","original_name":"Isaac Julien","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/3I1Su7TgaUYy1tecYUHDqTrzR2F.jpg","credit_id":"5f43d3aa99d5c30033bd602c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":902,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3RluMgdJJb0RDKFvgHJ8RsJz0NX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":260012,"name":"black british"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
