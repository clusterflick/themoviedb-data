The combination of massive collection of personal data and subsequent statistical processing, with an emphasis on inferential statistics to achieve persuasive goals (such as those of advertising and political communication), will lead to a terrible reality. The poem is not linear, it is a poem that regenerates itself differently each time a program is executed. The sequencing of the lines of the poem was developed to always obtain, in each regeneration, appropriate grammatical and semantic structures (in Spanish).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eGBXX4wMQ7fBxYWL1IPetmLRkxM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Data","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Bonilla","original_name":"Diego Bonilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f43de09477215003564c6b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodolfo Mata","original_name":"Rodolfo Mata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f43de2b414291003650b4db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eGBXX4wMQ7fBxYWL1IPetmLRkxM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
