Following the footsteps of the great Italian thinker Pier Paolo Pasolini, the filmmaker gains a deep insight into the social reality of present-day Italy. The country is massively affected by globalization, migration and the phenomenon of mass tourism, which, more than ever, is characterised by the same hedonistic conformity that Pasolini lamented more than fifty years ago. Ahead of me the South is a poetic contemporary document, a kaleidoscopic picture of the Italy of today.","popularity":0.2999,"poster_path":"/4x2rnqW53EkPRq6xxIlNvbJY0aj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vor mir der Süden","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pepe Danquart","original_name":"Pepe Danquart","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/ho0WxOVaKs4BNR29Iwnf66vEVg1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f45ff6bfdc4fa0035b9809a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini","original_name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini","popularity":0.6207,"profile_path":"/AdUQ0eBR9xWKh7f7KAN7yiHamAr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f45ff75511d090035b81057","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pepe Danquart","original_name":"Pepe Danquart","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/ho0WxOVaKs4BNR29Iwnf66vEVg1.jpg","credit_id":"5f45ff670d11f20033b77170","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9165014","wikidata_id":"Q100606225","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qDmonHAnONzzPVhgAUOsgiToNu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1btTrcTJaS3ZVPsFEjoE2Dhkp0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AsTrdbNJwnx5Pmkbi0RHZgoPdT7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/4x2rnqW53EkPRq6xxIlNvbJY0aj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
