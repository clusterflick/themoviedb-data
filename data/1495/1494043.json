He once defined himself as a \"cellist-skier,\" \"all alone\" in this category, which prompted James Couttet, world ski champion, to say: \"Of all the skiers I know, he's the best cellist.\" Echoing this, Professor at the Conservatoire National Supérieur, André Navarra, added: \"Of all the cellists I know, he's the best skier.\" Throughout his varied yet coherent career, Baquet helped to project a joyful and artistic image of the mountains. Who better to talk about Maurice and all his adventures than his alter-ego: Cérébos, the faithful cello that never left his side? From Paris to Chamonix, from the stage to the granite slabs and snowy slopes, this film follows Cérébos, crossing the century and above all... smiling!","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/nvOLcH2fNFauNTgHcFdauvF0a5l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42098,"logo_path":"/fOc6P2mnJQbIWSc6Ms37w8uYo3C.png","name":"Seven Doc","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":264527,"logo_path":"/jnoYDCH5671tpZZba3KTfZdjla7.png","name":"Les Éditions Publialp","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maurice Baquet, The Accorded","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Baquet","original_name":"Maurice Baquet","popularity":0.2711,"profile_path":"/kDoxH2SlJhVkUC97SmFkHu9x3Dz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"684386f85cb27fb822341d1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Rébuffat","original_name":"Gaston Rébuffat","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/szk0m7tvLXDMcXrwI4fEFrfFYX0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"684386ffd75f28bbdc205838","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3999722,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pierre Tairraz","original_name":"Pierre Tairraz","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/eW8qdf0Pa2kOd0qLFu6mhlqeJrv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"68438752075e60e6f9341d21","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dizzy Gillespie","original_name":"Dizzy Gillespie","popularity":0.2483,"profile_path":"/qc9mu8xBcPg32W3Rz09vdSJLBDE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"684387695f364cfe26fd5366","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Frison-Roche","original_name":"Roger Frison-Roche","popularity":0.0815,"profile_path":"/1sizN23VoLMnkEaXkDi8QEhMtSm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6843879e95ac06a73e20582f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5488595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Émile Allais","original_name":"Émile Allais","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iR4W6hCeOHJcs4XfiDOxWk46jch.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"68438791f6ed117842341d7e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2780392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Chappaz","original_name":"Gilles Chappaz","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/g5zbhGOoHN1JitOwrvnlZsjvDUW.jpg","credit_id":"684383d06ebf39ea81fd530f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2780392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Chappaz","original_name":"Gilles Chappaz","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/g5zbhGOoHN1JitOwrvnlZsjvDUW.jpg","credit_id":"684383d61ea651ba1cde656c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37213516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mjxUt19FNEn6CcBr3sL8gnYu04Y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rtsb6WUdFLQ76QMT7e7QUjeikip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zPECZuMf9Oa3zStwqAgWayALGcW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nvOLcH2fNFauNTgHcFdauvF0a5l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":3536,"name":"cello"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":6964,"name":"tribute"},{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":209282,"name":"french alps"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":299404,"name":"mountain documentary"},{"id":347026,"name":"mont-blanc mountains range"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival International du Film de Montagne d’Autrans (FIFMA)","release_date":"2023-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
