This struck me as a good idea. But then I thought, why turn these still pictures into a film? Why not start the series over again as a motion picture and take advantage of the wind and the rain and the movements of the water?” (Edward Steichen)","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/k8hTgWw5l01YapZwS5td83umW58.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Shad-Blow Tree","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1027003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Steichen","original_name":"Edward Steichen","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6845ccc62c399022f01ea5e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1113,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k8hTgWw5l01YapZwS5td83umW58.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":742}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
