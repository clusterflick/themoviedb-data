After experiencing heart failure brought by Covid-19 - Lynn found herself sick and in-between life and death. Now coming out on the other side - this work is a meditation on what it means to exist in the spaces between life’s fleeing moments. Ghostly silhouettes emerge and dissolve at the threshold between the world of the living and a shadowy realm. Muted colors with vibrant bursts suggest the fleeting nature of human experience. A celestial expanse reveals a distant watchful eye of the moons - a self-observing from afar - detached yet intimately aware of the cycle of existence. There is uncertainty and the weight of unfulfilled potential, a tension between existence and absence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Many Moons in the Vacancy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
