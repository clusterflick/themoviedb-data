What he tries to mirror is the essential aloneness of people, life in suspense, of unmotivated being. Adult life is seen in black and white; that of his infant son, Max, is in colour. The contrast suggests the loss of joy that comes with maturity and knowledge.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/jc3FvGqq7bWBEyP7i94dicYYf8P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1970-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film for Max","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek May","original_name":"Derek May","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68445cb8a33c020736de67ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68445cc95f364cfe26fd5631","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jc3FvGqq7bWBEyP7i94dicYYf8P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
