For Jeff Cox, big game animal trainer, it’s a dream come true, but for his long-time girlfriend, Barbara, it’s the end of a perfect fairytale. Jeff’s partner, David Mirschkov returns to the U.S. with unsettling news for Barbara. Jeff will be staying with the tiger project for an indefinite period. Feeling betrayed by Jeff’s unrelenting career, Barbara throws herself into a steamy affair with David. Barbara now has an insatiable desire for love and commitment, but her desperate need for traditional values contrasts with David’s inexhaustible search for utopian idealism. When lovers confront one another with opposing values, ‘Heartstrings’ get tangled in this racy, modern love story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nnsvOlezd0KRqxIkX4S1XVNDXPK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":264615,"logo_path":null,"name":"21st
