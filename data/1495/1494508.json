As graduation passes and their last summer together unfolds, they deal with awkward parties, confusing relationships, and the fear of growing up. Through quiet conversations and chaotic laughter, the film captures what it feels like to be on the edge of change, unsure of what’s next but clinging to the people who’ve made it all make sense.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rYpnFnbPcVRSfi1dVYULGEfoajb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This
