Through color, texture, and hands-on craftsmanship, it follows students as they transform blank canvases into imaginative worlds using only paint, brushes, and creativity.  Told without narration, the film immerses viewers in the sensory process—swirling colors, first sketches, and paint rolling across coarse fabric. Their work becomes a metaphor for making: layering ideas, collaborating, and bringing visions to life. The film ends with paint-stained hands and the backdrop rolled away, leaving the impression of worlds built together—by hand.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6hvjcsiiMMxWrcIsxdohAWuGOvL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Felinton Incorporated Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before you build the future, you must first paint it.","title":"Worlds Beneath Our Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5492904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Honesty","original_name":"Tamara Honesty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self- West Virginia University Professor","credit_id":"6845f2eb5aa37572d4292b76","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5492905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maguire Glass","original_name":"Maguire Glass","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self -
