Through carefully curated archival footage and historical narration, Bearing Witness to the Holocaust offers a stark, unflinching look at the atrocities uncovered by Allied forces as World War II came to a close.  Designed for use in high school curricula, the film provides students with a sobering visual record of the Holocaust and the profound human cost of hatred and indifference. More than just a historical account, it serves as a call to remembrance and moral responsibilityâ€”reminding viewers that we, the living, are entrusted with the duty to bear witness so that the horrors of the past are never forgotten.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/1Ov78F4pfv7MXeN7VXalHugviTK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bell, Book and Camera Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What was seen cannot be unseen.","title":"Bearing Witness to the Holocaust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5448647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce David Janu","original_name":"Bruce David Janu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wNWFOIDQWVlIsFZ3diYjY8cy3N8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"684462fbde99e80f6dfd55d0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5448647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce David Janu","original_name":"Bruce David Janu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wNWFOIDQWVlIsFZ3diYjY8cy3N8.jpg","credit_id":"6844631c98d4b1b8f3342016","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5448647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce David Janu","original_name":"Bruce David Janu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wNWFOIDQWVlIsFZ3diYjY8cy3N8.jpg","credit_id":"6844632c7a71a3dba3bb28f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13633964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Ov78F4pfv7MXeN7VXalHugviTK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bearing Witness to the Holocaust","key":"kfdI4YZX2l8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-03-27T14:43:51.000Z","id":"684463cb1fbdd9fa2fbb2970"}]}}}
