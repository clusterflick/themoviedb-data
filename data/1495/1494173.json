All that Digging, a sort of visual lullaby, touches on the less frequently discussed melancholy of motherhood, and the grief that can come from relinquishing parts of pre-parenthood life. Roscina explores the tension between being enclosed by the nest of domesticity, the fleetingness of this volatile yet precious time, and what can be gained through the act of letting go.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All That Digging","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5489361,"name":"Eileen Roscina","original_name":"Eileen Roscina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6843f6319ae1425b312059b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
