Heâ€™s outrun abuse and discrimination, but now he has a new adversary: ALS. Fortunately, John has a survival strategy of humor and hilarity that has served him all his life. While life is a ticking clock, and nothing is ever simple, what matters most, ultimately, is the humanity that unites us all.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qBBbFlk803s2njsfsOlceaIz1wo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loving John","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Rooy","original_name":"Robert Rooy","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68462e3158216a1685fd5cb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qBBbFlk803s2njsfsOlceaIz1wo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
