A recurring figure in the film is a Highland piper walking his beat on a lonely patch of ground beneath an elevated highway. The busload of sightseers encounters him as they do other objects of curiosity. At one point, the tour guide, a young woman, and the piper have a fling at dancing. It is a bus tour where everything is unexpected.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1969-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"McBus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek May","original_name":"Derek May","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68445eb98721aa4046fd5609","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223715","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
