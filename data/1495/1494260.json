The complex of five buildings, listed in 2014, operated from 1969 to 1983 as a repressive agency of the brazilian military dictatorship. The researchers' search for material remains and evidence of the passage of victims of repression through the site, such as inscriptions on the walls, personal objects and paper records, is essential to keeping alive the memory of the atrocities of the military dictatorship in Brazil.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/leKvSFjfd0H45nb370ZT79z68cW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arqueologia no DOI-Codi: Rompendo o Silêncio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5489664,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hebe Rios","original_name":"Hebe Rios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684438d263a50f0ede341fa2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5489666,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rafaela Repasch","original_name":"Rafaela Repasch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6844391a7350568d43de676f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/leKvSFjfd0H45nb370ZT79z68cW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arqueologia no DOI-Codi: rompendo o silêncio","key":"It9SeMZXtQA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-13T22:15:07.000Z","id":"6844361d8458a830ea301120"}]}}}
