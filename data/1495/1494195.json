To man she is a nuisance, a danger, and a threat we seek to eradicate, but to those who call her leaves home she is a friend, a sister, and a protector; often the first to rush in and cover land ripped open. And each year, as we warm the planet, she grows stronger and her territory expands. Leaves of Three is a science fiction fairytale exploring the parallels between land protection and bodily autonomy, the female relationship to poison, and what it means to engage deeply with a planet that, on occasion, wants us dead.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leaves of Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia de Guzman","original_name":"Julia de Guzman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68440a8eb2c4b2a3ca2924f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
