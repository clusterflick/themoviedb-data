It moves from intimate encounters between dancers and sea creatures to Indigenous ancestral narratives and the hand-drawn maps of the first ocean cartographer, Marie Tharp. The voices of Pacific activists, lawyers and scientists resonate throughout, reflecting the nuanced debates. A rolling transcript relays the latest meeting of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), where states are drawing up regulations for deep-sea mining, together with a public letter from the Republic of Nauru stating its intention to submit an application to mine.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soundings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Critchley","original_name":"Emma Critchley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684443c62e9fda5d25205a62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
