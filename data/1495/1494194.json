It has been performed many times before. It happens everywhere. On stages all over the world. In this story, Carmen betrays her partner, Don José. He loves her but she doesn’t feel the same. After running away, Don José tracks Carmen down to where she is hiding out. He tries to convince her to change her mind. She won’t. So, he kills her. Nobody wins. The audience typically stands up. Éist Liom is an experimental short film that fuses this iconic operatic story with new music, the Irish language and surreal imagery.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Éist Liom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
