Therefore, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the opera house into darkness for more than a year, the company once again found innovative ways to present the world’s greatest artists to music lovers around the globe.  Jonas Kaufmann, one of opera’s most in-demand tenors, kicked off the series at Bavaria’s magnificent Polling Abbey with a program of heroic arias, accompanied by pianist Helmut Deutsch. Including classic selections from the Italian and French repertoires—as well as a few lesser-known gems—the concert provided a rousing start to this groundbreaking new initiative.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Met Stars: Jonas Kaufmann","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68462662d24839e84e3fc755","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Halvorson","original_name":"Gary Halvorson","popularity":0.9558,"profile_path":"/9KwJweL5GN0y5rvsvBhBRlVtmb0.jpg","credit_id":"68462675bbfe31cc90292cd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":207592,"name":"piano"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
