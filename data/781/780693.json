These two have made a nest into the empty can of tomato soup, which Albi wears as a hat. To Albi, home is where the snow is, but the lack of furniture gives the place a not-so-homely feel. Albi has a stroke of genius, and he starts to build an armchair out of snow. The idea flourishes and soon he has a cozy home.","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albi The Snowman","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232297,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mikko Kunnas","original_name":"Mikko Kunnas","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feaff72c04429003dd6369d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915271,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Markus Majaluoma","original_name":"Markus Majaluoma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feaff94d7107e003e25ff57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6150164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"finstina\", \"english_name\"=>\"Finnish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fi\", \"native_name\"=>\"fin≈°tina\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
