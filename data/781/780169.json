Perhaps in the fleeting flames she saw the lights and sights of the ballroom. She chided herself for having married a man who was wedded to his professional duties. Of course, she admitted to herself, the hospital required her husband's duties. The brilliance of the ballroom beckoned with boisterous invitation to her yielding thoughts. She put the baby girl to sleep, and went to the ball alone. The lights were bright, the people were merry and she was happy.

The fire in the hearth, left to its own mischievous irresponsibility, had set the house ablaze.","popularity":0.1094,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through Flaming Gates","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Penitent Mother - the Moth","credit_id":"5fe8fe04b77d4b003ee7402e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.C.
