A city that becomes an emblem of irredentist and nationalist claims. It was in this Italy that the Fiume enterprise began on 12 September 1919: the adventure of Grabiele d'Annunzio and a handful of legionnaires who set out from Ronchi in Friuli, against the will of the established power, to occupy the Adriatic city and annex it to Italy, establish the Regency of Carnaro, and found a 'myth' destined to influence Italian and international culture and politics, aesthetics and vocabulary, well beyond the Twenty Years of Fascism.","popularity":0.4957,"poster_path":"/kt4wlfsMvXj2Ea5c7MmKx5FWhPs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1919 - Fiume, Città di Vita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"1999: Fiume, City of Life","type":"literal translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3011086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raoul Pupo","original_name":"Raoul Pupo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6481a35dbf31f200e3fbb5e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giordano Bruno Guerri Anselmi","original_name":"Giordano Bruno Guerri Anselmi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6481a37ae272600147b8760b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Perfetti","original_name":"Francesco Perfetti","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6481a398e375c000c5261604","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Mondini","original_name":"Marco Mondini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6481a3b5d2b20900ca1d8324","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Salaris","original_name":"Claudia Salaris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6481a3c999259c00ff0d0523","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrizio Marini","original_name":"Fabrizio Marini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6481a24fe2726000afc1244c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Maranesi","original_name":"Nicola Maranesi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6481a260d2b20900ca1d822b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro D'Onghia","original_name":"Alessandro D'Onghia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6481a45fe272600128787450","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102545,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Germana Mudanò","original_name":"Germana Mudanò","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6481a28ce2726000c92f2961","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/aju8fqZ7tT7IfHDYGiWguuuL4Bi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/kt4wlfsMvXj2Ea5c7MmKx5FWhPs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11007,"name":"post world war i"},{"id":259159,"name":"italian fascism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
