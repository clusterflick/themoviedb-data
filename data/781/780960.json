Estonian Heritage Society restored the monuments of the War of independence; the facts about war crimes during the Stalinist regime were disclosed and - imagine that! - the representatives of Estonian Republic went against the central authorities in Moscow. Events in Estonia draw international attention. Is all this possible in a totalitarian state? This documentary chronicle gives a plausibe interpretation of the events that took place in Estonia in 1988, of the changes in people's lives and the awakening after a 48-year-long period of darkness.","popularity":0.3549,"poster_path":"/qSMr7xki1UG9p892fsX9csmCIPu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1989-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Year of the Dragon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5febb8d5d7107e003f278a6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5febb90e64f716003b1019fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1596463,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marju Juhkum","original_name":"Marju Juhkum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/b78SsNwM9e8RauwPxD5Kzb0qrzk.jpg","credit_id":"5febb95d04733f003c9578c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":138141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erkki-Sven Tüür","original_name":"Erkki-Sven Tüür","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yhoJbf2PSGE1kh4892o0osaNm6u.jpg","credit_id":"5febb91dd40d4c003e865311","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5febb8ffd40d4c004085fa4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12007916","wikidata_id":"Q12360926","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1046,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSMr7xki1UG9p892fsX9csmCIPu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":697}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4109,"name":"independence movement"},{"id":173629,"name":"perestroika"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
