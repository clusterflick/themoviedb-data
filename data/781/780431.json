Groups of gods and sages appeared around the world precisely where humans suddenly discovered civilization.  Indigenous people describe these gifted people as human-like but not quite human: Followers of Horus, People of the Serpent, Sapti Rshi, Shining Ones, Offiusa, Lookers, Watchers, Hayhuaipanti, Urukehu, and Anu-naga, to name a few.  Who were these gods? Were they all connected? And have we been so obsessed with Atlantis and Lemuria that weâ€™ve ignored other locations where this parallel civilization once dwelt? Islands such as Lapukije, Te Petaka, Ta Neterw, iw titi, and an academy called the Birthplace of the Gods? Join best-selling author Freddy Silva on a history-changing journey to the oldest navels of the Earth, including Gobekli Tepe, the Nile Valley, Yucatan, Lake Titicaca, Easter Island, and New Zealand.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Missing Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
