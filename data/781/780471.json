But as this short documentary from the Northern Film School reveals, David has darker, more profound reasons to spend so much time in the shed. Following a terrible accident and several weeks in a coma, David fights his fears day-in, day-out: polishing, fixing and rebuilding, finding his way through the darkness. A documentary film from Yorkshire about life, death, and bicycles; a film about what pushes us beyond.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115476,"logo_path":"/wCR7E1paoQrlE4RztjafCqTRhZM.png","name":"Northern Film School","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A man's obsession with bicycles brings light to his dark, complicated past.","title":"Man On Bike","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2914156,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dylan Nicholson","original_name":"Dylan Nicholson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fea126907a808003d8e4b69","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2347329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max McLachlan","original_name":"Max McLachlan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/o5ZeYZYdEhD7KTxKcfdcImDbuOz.jpg","credit_id":"5fea127d5b1240003d6ca80c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191533,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Willy Curtis","original_name":"Willy Curtis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fea128e07a80800408fd05f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2914156,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dylan Nicholson","original_name":"Dylan Nicholson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fea125cc04429003dd4e01b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2914154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matteo Palmas","original_name":"Matteo Palmas","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fea12441d3563003fdd5730","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2914161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Camilo Angelo","original_name":"Camilo Angelo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fea12a5678259003f1bff29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5912848","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
