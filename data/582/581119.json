Five women forming his ‘harem’ disappeared within days.  In 2004, bones are found at the edge of Death Valley belonging to one of the disappeared women. In a series of Californian road trips, filmmaker Minou Norouzi reflects on what the women’s obsession with Castaneda may have been and begins to wonder if her own life isn’t mirroring theirs. She meets a concoction of Castaneda associates who are all invested in telling her about Castaneda, whilst the story of the women remains in shadow.","popularity":0.2479,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114598,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ad Lumina Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anatomy of Failure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1580356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Wallace","original_name":"Amy Wallace","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/fskAu67uWutcVI0RvfNCBou85VQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fd525c3a3683cc68f817f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Jennings","original_name":"Richard Jennings","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fd5399251413389bf8966","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman M.
