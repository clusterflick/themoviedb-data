Switching between positive and negative focus on the mystery of the hidden and unresolved narrative between the ‘lovers?’. On occasions, this work was shown in superimposition with sections of the film Talla. Two sound tapes were mixed in improvisation. A digital video version has been made using the original slide sequence and audio tapes.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/kkcD8R2m3b4AtVVJMQn7dH7W08g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wharf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Le Grice","original_name":"Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/dXry25TyoLUpViu8Paqf6RMkDv7.jpg","credit_id":"5c6278369251412fb4fc33b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ejebEhqdGAhC8hyXPhvntCf4P1K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kkcD8R2m3b4AtVVJMQn7dH7W08g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
