The rest of the disc features the domination by Mercedes-Benz in the grand prix races in 1954 (except the British and Spanish grands prix) and 1955, including the World Sports Car series.  Highlights of all the grand prix and sports car championship races are shown in black and white, the exception being the 1955 Monaco race, which was filmed in colour. The tragic 1955 Le Mans race is shown with a series of stills.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of the Silver Arrows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
