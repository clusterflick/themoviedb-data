It was ultimate act of punk resistance, a two-fingered salute to the repressive regime that gave a generation of young Soviets access to forbidden Western and Russian music, an act for which Rudy and his fellow bootleggers would pay a heavy price.","popularity":0.2598,"poster_path":"/jtRZfeEOAi7U6D0t5CAJSale3zx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"X-Ray Audio: The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Heartfield","original_name":"Paul Heartfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c621f97c3a3684f97d6eb8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephen Coates","original_name":"Stephen Coates","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c621f800e0a266dac96bac4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephen Coates","original_name":"Stephen Coates","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c621f860e0a266dac96bacc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Heartfield","original_name":"Paul Heartfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c621fd90e0a267df197289d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5489506","wikidata_id":"Q27055785","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jtRZfeEOAi7U6D0t5CAJSale3zx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":160339,"name":"vinyl record"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
