The film looks for the intangible and subjective element of the building’s history: the depth of its human print. The building appears as a sedimentation of life stories where each layer has left the trace of a passage. From the intimate nature of these stories, the film draws this fragile and undefined essence that could be called “the soul of the place”.","popularity":0.0888,"poster_path":"/4DZlVzeQcPFPxBXsPcJfEEhNXoq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bêka & Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An intimate portrait of a masterpiece from the beginning of architect Auguste Perret’s career: the building located on 25 Bis, Rue Franklin in Paris.","title":"25 Bis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ila Bêka","original_name":"Ila Bêka","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c63d7640e0a266dac9921f6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tiros Niakaj","original_name":"Tiros Niakaj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c63d537c3a368745ed909f1","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ila Bêka","original_name":"Ila Bêka","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c63d5050e0a267b9094c88e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Lemoine","original_name":"Louise Lemoine","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc5da70aafebd00411ebf65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Lemoine","original_name":"Louise Lemoine","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc5da8e8a84d2003f14c464","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ila Bêka","original_name":"Ila Bêka","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc5da5f21c4ca003f1edc4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Lemoine","original_name":"Louise Lemoine","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc5d8cea8858700400a010d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4DZlVzeQcPFPxBXsPcJfEEhNXoq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":90,"name":"paris, france"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"25BIS - Bêka & Lemoine's film on 25bis Rue Franklin by Auguste Perret - Trailer 1","key":"dDaxj6rwQis","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2013-11-25T21:30:01.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c63d5c50e0a266dac991e10"}]}}}
