Filmed in the underbelly of Buenos Aires, the film plunges the viewer in the murky investigation of a crime where love, money and betrayal are all intricately woven together. With seductive strains of Tango in the background, the viewer is jarred by the counterpoint between Marcial's discourse - his version of the events as told to the police - versus the truth on the screen.","popularity":0.0815,"poster_path":"/ayWsZ1L0ReG49Qqam78BJKi3mU6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love, money and betrayal are all intricately woven together in Marcial's police statement","title":"Marcial's Version","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Jarach","original_name":"Ariel Jarach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marcial","credit_id":"5c6119370e0a267dfd95818b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gonzalo Gil","original_name":"Gonzalo Gil","popularity":0.0425,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"5c6119560e0a267dfd95822e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Florido","original_name":"Raúl Florido","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gordo","credit_id":"5c624e710e0a267de8974c92","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Böhm","original_name":"Daniel Böhm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655afad6d4fe0400fe0873e2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Böhm","original_name":"Daniel Böhm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c61191b9251412fbcfa1857","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715213,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Aldo Guglielmone","original_name":"Aldo Guglielmone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c61ce159251412fbffb348d","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":999842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis García","original_name":"José Luis García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c61cdf7925141250afad519","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0381691","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2712,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayWsZ1L0ReG49Qqam78BJKi3mU6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1808}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1991-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
