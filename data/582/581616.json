The landscape passes by in epic tranquillity as the audience immerses itself in the world of barge shipping. The top permitted speed for smaller watercraft is specified in the inland waterways regulations as a maximum of 15 km/h. A woman is along for the ride on Germany’s rivers and canals, with plenty of time to explore this little-known cosmos. In the end, the director dreams of a life on board and endeavours to find her place in the predominantly male domain.  Welt an Bord is a hybrid of documentary and narrative film. The basic conditions are set by the limited space on the barge and the work that must be done. Kathrin Resetarits embodies the alter ego of director Eva Könnemann, while she herself takes charge of the cinematography. Together they accepted the captain’s invitation to join in this other life. What kind of life is it anyway? Resetarits/Könnemann listen and work their way through fiction and reality.","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World on Board","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":313606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathrin Resetarits","original_name":"Kathrin Resetarits","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Filmmaker","credit_id":"5d271c9c5f6c4900105e054a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Wöhlke","original_name":"Kai Wöhlke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sailor","credit_id":"5d271cabcaab6d0014971fa5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Van der Putten","original_name":"Ron Van der Putten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Skipper","credit_id":"5d271cbdbe4b36111d9e0d1f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Könnemann","original_name":"Eva Könnemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d271c21be4b36000f9e10ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482666,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Gheorghiu","original_name":"Alexander Gheorghiu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d271c34caab6d0014971cd3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Könnemann","original_name":"Eva Könnemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d271d355f6c4900115dfc76","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Könnemann","original_name":"Eva Könnemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d271c495f6c4900125de218","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Könnemann","original_name":"Eva Könnemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d271c285f6c4900115df77c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Könnemann","original_name":"Eva Könnemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d271c3e5f6c4900105e03f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Könnemann","original_name":"Eva Könnemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d271c55caab6d0013971a8d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10472194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale Shorts 2019","release_date":"2019-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
