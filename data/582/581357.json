The German composer sets to music the fate of 150 people who have been shipwrecked and abandoned to their destiny. This is a radical work that fluctuates between hope and inevitability, agony and sudden bursts of life.  The Raft of the Medusa is an oratorio that was first performed in 1968. Fifty years on, the Italian director Romeo Castellucci underscores its immense modernity, drawing a striking parallel between Hans Werner Henze’s work and the current migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.","popularity":0.0957,"poster_path":"/tr9yJDUbPd0LqzWgv9ue8q2S8yT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Raft of the Medusa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Duesing","original_name":"Dale Duesing","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/zM4E5HDkbplKe3XduKcKObKpcS2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6134679251412fb8fa3320","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Skovhus","original_name":"Bo Skovhus","popularity":0.1043,"profile_path":"/wK6k0oyZlMJLqLM9Ew2sQHdgtCO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c61346e9251412fc6fa44f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenneke Ruiten","original_name":"Lenneke Ruiten","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6134750e0a267df1959674","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Castellucci","original_name":"Romeo Castellucci","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/1EDH1YiA5FS1JkPuD63s7qUOom5.jpg","credit_id":"5c613484c3a3684fabd56d62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1071,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tr9yJDUbPd0LqzWgv9ue8q2S8yT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
