It is based on childhood memories of a renowned Mozambican artist Fiel dos Santos who grew up during the 16-year civil war – another proxy war sustained by conflicting foreign powers. Fiel created eight figures representing his father, mother, five brothers and sister from decommissioned AK-47s. Three New York artists turned them into puppets and animated. Little Fiel tells a universal story of peaceful people who have been coerced, conscripted and enticed into killing each other. It is our desperate act of hope.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fGwJFzrhVnzqfBApzFZRyRBXRqn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Fiel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Patkanian","original_name":"Irina Patkanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5f47ce0e0a261deb6ab207","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238617,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irina Patkanian","original_name":"Irina Patkanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5f47d39251413389beaea1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238618,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gus Ford","original_name":"Gus Ford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5f47dfc3a3683cd58e6e7e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238619,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Chris Langer","original_name":"Chris Langer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5f483f0e0a261de56abb04","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1008,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fGwJFzrhVnzqfBApzFZRyRBXRqn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
