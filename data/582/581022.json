Qi Gong is a Chinese health system that's been practiced for centuries to improve mental and physical awareness.  Taught by Matthew Cohen, a martial-arts master with 30 years' experience, these two programs cultivate strength and tranquility.  The Tai Chi program contains three segments.  First, you'll learn the essential poses of Tai Chi.  Next, you'll move through the postures to create harmony and grace while increasing flexibility and endurance.  Finally, you'll put it all together to build overall muscle tone and promote vigor and vitality.  The Qi Gong program conditions the body and expands the senses through slow, natural, repetitive movements.  You'll stimulate your immune system and gain a sense of balance and inner calm with this healing practice.","popularity":0.3576,"poster_path":"/9x682UhXCeD2a9gf74yCb6fAjD8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acacia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Develop total-body strength; Increase energy, stamina and agility; Promote serenity and vitality","title":"Tai Chi & Qi Gong Basics","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9x682UhXCeD2a9gf74yCb6fAjD8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s8o3JduhWNgra4btGiHbvlfTR0S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11051,"name":"tai chi"},{"id":208619,"name":"qigong"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
