There have been some memorable puppet-theatre performances of opera, but with Caligula Le Poème Harmonique and Arcal invite us to savour something quite original by bringing together two artistic traditions that have long been separated: those of Venetian opera and Sicilian puppet-theatre. On stage, the singers and instrumentalists, conducted by Vincent Dumestre, lend their voices and rich sound to the pupi of Mimmo Cuticchio, large stick-puppets belonging to a great theatrical tradition dating back to the seventeenth century.","popularity":0.375,"poster_path":"/IQ29MGsBWJhwpjjlcNKSvaEV3K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arcal","origin_country":""},{"id":159651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le
