This powerful drama exposes the deep-seated racial tensions hidden in British family life during the late 1950s.  Written for the stage by Unity Theatre's Ted Willis, this television recording was filmed a few weeks after the play's successful West End run, and most of the stage cast repeat their roles here, including the terrific John Slater, Andree Melly and Lloyd Reckord. The drama's interracial kiss is probably the first to be shown on British TV.","popularity":0.2916,"poster_path":"/xeQhp2OFSfghFjIOJ5AcC8PhhZ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1959-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Summer Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Slater","original_name":"John Slater","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":"/hZ6uPRgU61k7yARO8Yk6ybJq6s8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jack Palmer","credit_id":"5c6181cd0e0a267de6961f49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Reckord","original_name":"Lloyd Reckord","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/ugpcnFk8elaNwSoPbD9EIVnu9nR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sonny Lincoln","credit_id":"5c6181dec3a3681b7cd5a319","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Dunning","original_name":"Ruth Dunning","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/afMRGXk3AvnzON6xT88ESHtuqLI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nell Palmer","credit_id":"5c6181ebc3a3684fabd5e2e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Harrold","original_name":"Scott Harrold","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Old Man","credit_id":"5c618200c3a368745ed59a9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Howard","original_name":"Joyce Howard","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":"/73OxaNLjqqrcck1SO3c7RvlEIge.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Judy Gomez","credit_id":"5c618212c3a3684fa4d62072","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrée Melly","original_name":"Andrée Melly","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kathie Palmer","credit_id":"5c6182209251412fbcfaa2ab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Walter","original_name":"Richard Walter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Frank Stephens","credit_id":"5c61826ec3a3684fa4d620f7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Kotcheff","original_name":"Ted Kotcheff","popularity":0.5173,"profile_path":"/kbayJIuimvJJUvMBgKWZz3KGjPa.jpg","credit_id":"5c6180ecc3a3681b7cd5a1f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57293,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Sydney Newman","original_name":"Sydney Newman","popularity":0.212,"profile_path":"/QKW3Widw7yaemYlB3NKEmJrhrF.jpg","credit_id":"5c618288c3a3684fa8d5ec28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236666,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ted Willis","original_name":"Ted Willis","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c61829e9251412fbffab00a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215855","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xeQhp2OFSfghFjIOJ5AcC8PhhZ7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v3kzpp7GLyJ5uxVkoY31PJgYPU8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1998}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ABC, Armchair Theatre","release_date":"1959-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
