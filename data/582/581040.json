Lisa is eight and spending the summer with her parents in the mountains. But the much-vaunted beauty of nature provides the young girl with little comfort in the sparse Alpine landscape. Instead, it seems eerie. Her father is often away and her mother is always busy with washing and doing the dishes. Lisa watches and fantasises about being far away – ideally in Persia. In the South Tirolean dialect, “kribus krabus” means “topsy turvy”. The “domine” in the title stands for the opposite, for God, control, and power.
