With the untitled double photomural, the dialogue was rather between the living and the dead. These dense mosaics of ghostly, close-cropped faces—somewhere between icons and X rays—were in fact portraits of some 180 Gazans killed during the intifada, reworked from ID photos and snapshots to transform living images into effigies of the dead that appeared and disappeared like fleeting memories as the viewer walked in front of them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaza Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taysir Batniji","original_name":"Taysir Batniji","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68679d5528b94ff44a7b7abd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
