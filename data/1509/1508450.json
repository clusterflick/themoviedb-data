One of the women, María 'La Rata', describes life in the slum settlement of a seafaring town that was a destination for migrants during the Spanish Civil War, a time of repression and of prosperity for the local oligarchy as a result of the growth in tuna purse-seining and long-lining. Zapal invites us to reflect on the underworlds on the outskirts of cities and on forced displacements caused by poverty and war.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1DwWh88tFvnxRB2G9RCgrHH1gHa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zapal, la memoria de una fotografía","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860749,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francisco Artacho","original_name":"Francisco Artacho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6868545f1b9a8ab1e8a94cb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Tirado","original_name":"José Luis Tirado","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68685476c2c18530d1ced9fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1DwWh88tFvnxRB2G9RCgrHH1gHa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
