Dried giant clams in the Reef Islands","overview":"The Reef Islands Ethnographic Film Project was started in 1994 by the two anthropologists, Jens Pinholt and Peter I. Crawford, and village communities in Bekapoa, Ngasinue/Fenualoa and Vaiakau. Field and film visits took place in 1994, 1995-1998, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017. This film is based on one such visit in June 2015, by Peter I. Crawford and Birgitte Hansen, a nutrition expert. The focus was on a diachronic study of nutrition, collecting information in three villages and comparing it with material from the 1970s and the 1990s. Pileni was one of the villages.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/41sj66poMBwID3jODSbug273I2u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189289,"logo_path":"/r2jpsZdINbv6c7TUI1evEiQB4l9.png","name":"UiT Norges arktiske universitet","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":267118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aarhus Universitet","origin_country":""},{"id":267119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intervention Press","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pileni paualala.
