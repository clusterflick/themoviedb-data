After escaping capture a 5th time, she decides to engage V for a 6th and hopefully final time. PG's cocky attitude and false sense of self-assurance won't allow her to admit she may not have the strength or skill to win. As was the case the first 5 times, she gets captured yet again. Hanging AOH, V reminds PG of her seemingly insane persistence by recapping the first 5 engagements, each ending with PG in V's dungeon. Returning to real time, V decides PG needs to finally learn a lesson at the end of a whip. She figures maybe PG will be more compliant when following, she administers a Power Drain on poor PG's power center.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/emMutSC5rA5O98Jr51tmKjWPJT1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Persistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5546357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Layla Rylan","original_name":"Layla Rylan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Power Girl","credit_id":"6869c4a589dc8fa30e51d8e4","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5546417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayla Coyote","original_name":"Kayla Coyote","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"V","credit_id":"6869c4d5f3d805056051d82d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5546419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6869c4ec8de47e8a7e702645","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nQYGrGUyErr5G40HSkvxfWMFNwc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":756,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/emMutSC5rA5O98Jr51tmKjWPJT1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
