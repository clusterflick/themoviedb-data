But exactly on the due date of his release, a soldier is being kidnapped and a new war breaks out. The condition of her shell-shocked father, Ya'akov, starts to deteriorate as Ido calls to say that all discharges have been put on hold. The angst-ridden Anat tries to get him back home appealing to the kindness of the commanding officers. Ido returns, but her spirit is broken when she discovers that discharges were not suspended - it was he who volunteered to fight. Their symbiotic relationship goes downhill, Ido returns to the border post and the battle flares up. Before his unit enters Lebanon, Anat, who feels trapped between her father and her son, decides to take matters into her own hands.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Oxygen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Ivgy","original_name":"Dana Ivgy","popularity":0.4682,"profile_path":"/w5qlA2HdzIXZpqMlf2KbEOhLNSH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anat","credit_id":"68682bd099e3aab4f151d302","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3354391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Sultan","original_name":"Ben Sultan","popularity":0.6238,"profile_path":"/gWi2IEvZM3XojWLOpuZQwZEWQhd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ido","credit_id":"68682be4f057aba91aced8fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marek Rozenbaum","original_name":"Marek Rozenbaum","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Yaki","credit_id":"68682bf9ba81d2d162ed4cf9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Netalie Braun","original_name":"Netalie Braun","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686831a5ce4b63e06953f1c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716068,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adi Bar Yossef","original_name":"Adi Bar Yossef","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686831be327a052ea453f1a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314431,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aviv Ben Shlush","original_name":"Aviv Ben Shlush","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686831cea46a022c97a94bd2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Netalie Braun","original_name":"Netalie Braun","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686831e9dd25edf63370206d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Netalie Braun","original_name":"Netalie Braun","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686831fd5a3c40c60053f19b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577287,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itay Marom","original_name":"Itay Marom","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6868320d8e0f9512dc70202f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72574,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nili Feller","original_name":"Nili Feller","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68683225a1aab494bc702043","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3490603,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nitzan Zifrut","original_name":"Nitzan Zifrut","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6868323ae43369073151d355","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260278,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carmel Meir","original_name":"Carmel Meir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6868324ffc7d856bb6a94c18","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675014,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nin Hazan","original_name":"Nin Hazan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6868326ed150c3cc65a94c34","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aviv Aldema","original_name":"Aviv Aldema","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6868328248e76658149a3497","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034764,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chamutal Zerem","original_name":"Chamutal Zerem","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6868329782737718d851d341","department":"Production","job":"Casting"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37496619","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
