With specific instructions to exercise caution, blend in, and to capture Dr. Fernel at all costs, Solaria arrives at the reported lab location at undisclosed northwest US coordinates. Confirmed intelligence reports he is in possession of kryptonium, but his resumed experiments into a dangerous experimental steroidal compound are of greater concern to the senators. The recent public incident which caused massive destruction and forced an area wide memory wipe, was caused by a common thug with unusual strength and resistance to normal weapons. The compound's origin has been traced to Fernel and Solaria knows she must capture Fernel before he has a chance to react. If Solaria was better at listening and heeding caution, she may have entered the lab undetected and possibly used the element of surprise in her favor.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s2OlUo8DnA2uxmaHOyFC10Pm7eo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Power","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3483986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Halsey Rae","original_name":"Halsey Rae","popularity":0.622,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Solaria","credit_id":"68693d7c2ac14e0b4c103119","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68693d9a6ce9d985b0ed516a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nn2hz9W5UpoosRQYEyowZ6NxQ1a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":877,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s2OlUo8DnA2uxmaHOyFC10Pm7eo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":585}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
