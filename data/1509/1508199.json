Von Augenblick und Ewigkeit","overview":"Peter Engelhardt - aptly named “PENG” - has dedicated his entire life to good design: as a renowned designer as well as a collector of everything that makes up everyday life in the 50s, 60s and 70s ... The well-known and the nameless, the precious and the superfluous, the special and the everyday. The Engelhardt collection once comprised over 30,000 objects. But the more Peter collected, the more space he needed - and the less money he had. The last stop for the time being: a dilapidated industrial wasteland near Bingen, rainwater and theft the biggest enemies. The preservation of the collection - or rather the fight against its destruction - in the old mine in Waldalgesheim became the 78-year-old's life's work.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2gRtQ1h4JV4OHey2xCp4HCPIWQx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267013,"logo_path":null,"name":"augenAuf!
