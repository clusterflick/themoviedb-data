The series is made up of “Padre.Madre”, “EL Templo” and “El Arca”. The films were shown together as a film installation at Upstream Gallery. These films are the foundational chapters of a new creed. They present a savage procession, moving between sacred and intimate, beautiful and horrific, canonical and arbitrary, sublime and bestial. Every film is the beginning of a myth and also its immediate decadence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diluvio","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Temple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquín Cociña","original_name":"Joaquín Cociña","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/60Lyv6KXaWtrCxC4rPPKVSUdFP.jpg","credit_id":"68687fa45becaf12ad102e2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristóbal León","original_name":"Cristóbal León","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/sQVbiyJr2jDFkvp2w5Iwr1jV3cU.jpg","credit_id":"68687fb3e7e769a787cedab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817610,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Vasquez","original_name":"Carlos Vasquez","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68687fec501988a24c1032a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Upstream Gallery Amsterdam","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"De Ateliers","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
