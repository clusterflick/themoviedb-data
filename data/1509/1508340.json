In 1874, Winston Churchill, grandson of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, was born at Blenheim and spent a large amount of time at the palace throughout his life, later proposing to his wife within the stunning grounds. Churchill also became dear friends with Consuelo Vanderbilt, who married into the Churchill family and became Winston's confidant.
