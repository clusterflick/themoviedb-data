Through rare personal and public archival materials, the film reveals the complex world of the Rovinas—a fascinating lineage of women marked by beauty, grace, and strength, yet also by pain, flaws, and life-altering choices. This is a story of women, of mothers and daughters, of fame and solitude, of love and sacrifice, and of the lasting impact of past decisions on generations to come.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rovina Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Rovina","original_name":"Hanna Rovina","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68695475172af16ba29a38f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilana Rovina","original_name":"Ilana Rovina","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68695485364bef0384cedd3e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2724591,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sigal Rosh","original_name":"Sigal Rosh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6869541cc55cd072b91030fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2823029,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stav Meron Morag","original_name":"Stav Meron Morag","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ugrQPLkNidiwkAD5h7cGPN4IRrg.jpg","credit_id":"6869542e5cfab44819ed505a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shauly Melamed","original_name":"Shauly Melamed","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6869543b9dbe9189161030a5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
