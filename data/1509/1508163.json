Could Nosebleed, an unmade movie by Jackie Chan, have prevented the 9/11 attacks? Can we defeat the Enemy of Mankind armed only with copies of Anne of Green Gables and Dr Xavier Crement's Asshole trilogy? All is revealed in Ken Campbell's brilliant one-man comedy show.  In this, the penultimate one-man show by maverick comedian, playwright and director Ken Campbell (1941-2008), Ken talks about the mysteries of quantum physics, the multiverse and time travel, the significance of Jackie Chan and Anne of Green Gables, and why he doesn't believe in anything but supposes lots. And why everybody you know is some kind of arsehole.  This unique film was made in 2004 at his home and environs in Loughton and Epping Forest, Essex. Written and performed by Ken Campbell, filmed by Leon Hatcher, edited by John Cattle, produced and (sort of) directed by James Nye.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/f4YET8ZKufr1opi31cb59rjkUIW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ken Campbell's Meaning of Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Campbell","original_name":"Ken Campbell","popularity":0.2894,"profile_path":"/vnDf7qSyuZ5EsVPKNNeocvnA0Qo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6867a8ffbcd97ac9f79b3358","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Campbell","original_name":"Ken Campbell","popularity":0.2894,"profile_path":"/vnDf7qSyuZ5EsVPKNNeocvnA0Qo.jpg","credit_id":"6867a9130f706ce3a6eeb4d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5543475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Nye","original_name":"James Nye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867a9410ec445b96b7ab858","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5543476,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leon Hatcher","original_name":"Leon Hatcher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867a9534397addfee1b24d5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547062,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Cattle","original_name":"John Cattle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867a966187fe5f43d5e37b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5543477,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Max Brennan","original_name":"Max Brennan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867a9e91f7353ba9beeb45a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5543475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Nye","original_name":"James Nye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867a9f4ce52c6453179e212","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5543475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Nye","original_name":"James Nye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867aa1939e2b390599b336c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4YET8ZKufr1opi31cb59rjkUIW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
