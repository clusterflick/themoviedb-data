While waiting they make awkward small talk: one reveals his lofty ambitions for the future, while the other doesn't have a plan - he's paralyzed by dark predictions of where humanity is headed. The light’s still red, eventually Shu gets out of the car to press the crosswalk button and noticing that the usually busy road is deserted, he stops to take in the peace and quiet. T gets out the car as well and increasingly surreal events begin to occur under the gaze of the buzzing red light. The boys are able to come to communion by agreeing that there is still a possible future worth fighting for. The light turns green, but the two boys stay in the intersection and play.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yA7ID6kwSMvzvs08pT4OvLIJPGy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yoruba","iso_639_1":"yo","name":"Èdè Yorùbá"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life's Red Light (or 'Doomers')","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2815366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayo Solanke","original_name":"Ayo Solanke","popularity":1.8271,"profile_path":"/aJSKswDUTCMjwniKRTbVy44hDDC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6867dcdc26be26978267738e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5543746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Mao","original_name":"Nathan Mao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6867dce6a87f16cd751b261b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2274100,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeremy Cox","original_name":"Jeremy Cox","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/kt0YbkMMHk8GTf988seJpH1sebO.jpg","credit_id":"6867dcfce9ab8d7b341b259c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1887939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Steele","original_name":"Rebecca Steele","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/9aagWj8Q4fGfxUcch08BDCjgjID.jpg","credit_id":"6867dd0f9742cc4ad79b3408","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Carney","original_name":"Joseph Carney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867dd24d9c0b5d4d49b33e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Carney","original_name":"Joseph Carney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867dd781f7353ba9beeb53f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31030584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yA7ID6kwSMvzvs08pT4OvLIJPGy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LIFE'S RED LIGHT (or 'Doomers') Trailer","key":"881874339","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-06T22:56:00.000Z","id":"6867dcc4c9c59dbec47ab9d8"}]}}}
