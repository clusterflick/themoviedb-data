Known for his charm and defiance, he often clashes with the Haozakura-kai yakuza gang. Things take a turn when he meets Masami, the niece of the gang’s boss, and finds himself caught in their world. As tensions escalate, Jin grows close to Suzuhata, one of the yakuza members persuing him, who reminds him of his dead young brother and becomes his unexpected ally. But then Masami is now dangerously obsessed with Jin, and the consequences of his entanglements come to a head.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zVfnemTm2juugS4A0Apz4F9C6gh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91897,"logo_path":"/leIK67PDSwSkJtFgSvVbkP7EIm1.png","name":"Softgarage","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Minami of the West, Thug of the East!","title":"Dochinpira","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dochinpira - The Thug","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaki Nishimori","original_name":"西守正樹","popularity":0.3928,"profile_path":"/sfIXpaHrA2vEZii3r60KUubZTXv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kaito Jin","credit_id":"6867242d98dd5f147479e0ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenji Haga","original_name":"羽賀研二","popularity":0.5495,"profile_path":"/nTQ7oFP7ZFjbAxGEwi18xBmUmmd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6867243c425aa5f5779bc6f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginji Gao","original_name":"我王銀次","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6867244dd8a8b74efe677191","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5542993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"浦西真理子","original_name":"浦西真理子","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"686724888c92c6ea477ab75a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5542995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"矢野和美","original_name":"矢野和美","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"686724e592c902b46f9bc6c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1119543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanako Kishi","original_name":"岸加奈子","popularity":0.4899,"profile_path":"/cgbuBQOmNr9QHxeXDFNvgqz6U2z.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"686724fb4689b507747b797b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5542996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"飯村いづみ","original_name":"飯村いづみ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"686725167be0575f82eeb338","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5542998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"キラーカン","original_name":"キラーカン","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6867252992c902b46f9bc6d6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinobu Murata","original_name":"村田忍","popularity":0.2453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867255d4689b507747b7982","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5543008,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Makoto Machino","original_name":"町野誠","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867271d31c91fbb5d79e124","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553387,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yū Yamamoto","original_name":"山本優","popularity":0.4308,"profile_path":"/3CMy78DLJOGhrdbPEnJK1gPDSEV.jpg","credit_id":"686735f2446592d434991f2a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3698160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Makio Hara","original_name":"Makio Hara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686738b6cdcccbad3e991f46","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3424239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tetsumi Doko","original_name":"Tetsumi Doko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686738c63cb96579ce991f17","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVfnemTm2juugS4A0Apz4F9C6gh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Unknown day and month of the release year","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
