Dolphins have a special kinship-related link to the Aiwoo-speaking people in Tuo.  Moffat Bonunga tells the legend or so-called local kastom story that explains why. Moffat's explanations are linked with those of another local expert, Commins Veio, who tells his version of the story to Nathaniel Meningi inside the men's house (sapolau) in Tuo. The night the dolphins run ashore, Moffat immediately contacts the film crew - the villagers want the crew to film this peculiar phenomenon. Although the film focuses on the kastom story and the villagers' re-enactment of the hunt, it also documents the villagers' joy that the sea once again has proved an important source of food.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/30lIvNNuFwIFNPsnEwkznVHM40r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267121,"logo_path":null,"name":"SOT film","origin_country":""},{"id":267119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intervention Press","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A special event when dolphins ran ashore at Tuo village.
