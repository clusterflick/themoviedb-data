Comic relief in Glyndebourne's ‘brilliant production’ is provided by ‘beautifully sung live-wire performances’ of Pedrillo and Blonde, and Robin Ticciati leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment through a restored, authentic rendition of the critical score with ‘lovely fizz’ and ‘poignant gravitas’ (The Independent).
