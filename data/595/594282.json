In English, La Guerre oubliée means The Forgotten War. Here, we talk about the 1914-18 big thing. This documentary doesn't use old footage, but actors to show us some parts of that war in Quebec. Joe Bocan sings some songs of that period and makes the narrations. There's also some rare veterans of the war who talk.","popularity":0.2037,"poster_path":"/nfP4ghMro56tnjfUPZ2RIO0Bn1k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Vent d'Est","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forgotten War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Forgotten War","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Bocan","original_name":"Joe Bocan","popularity":0.0908,"profile_path":"/3fXaSG2pXJo1demv7Q0w5pbe925.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"La Madelon","credit_id":"5cafa8869251412fb322e336","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eudore Belzile","original_name":"Eudore Belzile","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Le petit conscrit","credit_id":"5cafa895c3a3683c20aafdfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1900423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Louis Paris","original_name":"Jean-Louis Paris","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/qyUi327cDDA9sT6S1F8qyANiLsa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Le cardinal Bégin","credit_id":"5cafa89f0e0a2626c5c35272","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Godin","original_name":"Jacques Godin","popularity":0.1274,"profile_path":"/c9ACZyRtPBuTMFU9LmLESeMJR96.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Le général Lessard","credit_id":"5cafa8a99251412fad22a460","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc-Martial Dagenais","original_name":"Luc-Martial Dagenais","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/jY7gX1VvSHkZ0d9bngVA3ymg9Su.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"L'aide de camp","credit_id":"5cafa8c6925141776120d134","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168433,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Vanherweghem","original_name":"Robert Vanherweghem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62212c4537b3a90019b96d09","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Boutet","original_name":"Richard Boutet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cafa8e6c3a3683c30ab2ec2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Boutet","original_name":"Richard Boutet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cafa8dbc3a3683c2bab3f33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286533,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucille Veilleux","original_name":"Lucille Veilleux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cafa9010e0a2626c5c352fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0144226","wikidata_id":"Q939803","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nfP4ghMro56tnjfUPZ2RIO0Bn1k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
