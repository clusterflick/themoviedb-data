This documentary takes a glimpse behind the make-up, wigs and corsets to find out what it takes to live a life in drag, why people do it and the daily battles drag queens still face, following three queens at different stages in their drag careers.  Barbara La Bush, the self-proclaimed ‘oldest queen in Glasgow’, represents traditional end-of-the-pier drag. She must come to terms with ailing health and the insecurity of a working life spent on the clubs and pubs circuit. Lawrence Chaney, part of the Instagram generation of highly looks-focused performers, seeks approval from a mainstream culture that is out of her comfort zone. And new queen Voss must battle the prejudices of a job in the merchant navy as well as gain parental acceptance.","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":"/qayrcF1aaWKUE0yyjWsOlPYg1Gi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary that finds out what it takes to live a life in drag, following three queens at different stages in their drag careers.","title":"Mother Tuckers: Drag Queens of Glasgow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2288379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Chaney","original_name":"Lawrence Chaney","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":"/vD66Y7cvG0XL2mpfn1Is5dpg67q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lawrence Chaney","credit_id":"5cb329929251412fad275809","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Voss","original_name":"Voss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voss","credit_id":"5cb329ab9251412fa82787ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara La Bush","original_name":"Barbara La Bush","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Barbara La Bush","credit_id":"5cb329c69251412fa82787e4","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qHzfbqZyOnwj7c99kba1P57RvFq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qayrcF1aaWKUE0yyjWsOlPYg1Gi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
