Located more than 200 km above the polar circle, the Swedish mining town Kiruna is built on the world's largest and most modern iron ore mining tunnel, which created a significant income for the Swedish government. However, due to the mining the city has started to collapse and in order to save the industry, the city council together with the mining company LKAB have decided to move the town and its citizens 3 kilometres to the east. In doing so, the town has turned a potential disaster into a great opportunity. The new Kiruna will be an even more progressive, even better society for the future. But is it even possible to plan an ideal world?","popularity":0.2718,"poster_path":"/s4OfaegkN1U5YX2frs39xNAyDmZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108294,"logo_path":"/eOSTlnLaFjDD4rQOAxDicOTMOcs.png","name":"Analog Vision","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2020-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Northern Sami","iso_639_1":"se","name":""},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiruna - A Brand New World","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Kiruna","type":"Theatrical release"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2285594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greta Stocklassa","original_name":"Greta Stocklassa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf85dc3a36812991a324d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2285594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greta Stocklassa","original_name":"Greta Stocklassa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf875c3a36812b31a4f7f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2285595,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michal Kráčmer","original_name":"Michal Kráčmer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf87ec3a36812a41a4334","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Veronika Kührová","original_name":"Veronika Kührová","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf8969251417a84014a1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1877445,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stanislav Adam","original_name":"Stanislav Adam","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/82wlAXbFFCh9pAePxrJeQKyurm5.jpg","credit_id":"5cadf8aec3a36812991a3291","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2285597,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomáš Frkal","original_name":"Tomáš Frkal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf8c99251417a8e0139a7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2285598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomáš Kotas","original_name":"Tomáš Kotas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf8df9251417a820136f1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2285599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hana Dvořáčková","original_name":"Hana Dvořáčková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf8f60e0a2630e95a978f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2285600,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pavel Jan","original_name":"Pavel Jan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbcc31e92514108d8fe0f96","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6910396","wikidata_id":"Q104898192","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s4OfaegkN1U5YX2frs39xNAyDmZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1701,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/s14Pnjdtk8PYUGO6Cs5BywjSbRH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1134}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
