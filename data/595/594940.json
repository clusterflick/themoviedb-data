It is winter and the fishing boats have been put into dry dock. Samuel makes the most of this respite to implement his career plan. He wants to buy the boat from Clément, who is retiring, and become his own captain. Samuel is ambitious and passionate. Despite the obvious difficulties represented by such a project today, the strengthening of regulations, quotas and diminishing resources, he persists with his idea. Few young people in his village have chosen to stay like him and even fewer have chosen to take over a traditional activity that is jeopardised these days.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/jRbdQwZHB5W2LPGWuLPtX5d1t50.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homeport","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2254760,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Lefebvre","original_name":"Philippe Lefebvre","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbc5f3a92514108d1fd1ad6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Lévesque","original_name":"Laurence Lévesque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f8bf0e0a2626cac82560","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Lévesque","original_name":"Laurence Lévesque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f8d70e0a2626e9c7f018","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288269,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sébastien Blais","original_name":"Sébastien Blais","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f8ef9251412fb0273ea8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288271,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Pier Grignon","original_name":"Marie-Pier Grignon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f9179251412f9d2722a2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288273,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxime Carpentier","original_name":"Maxime Carpentier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f9339251412fa8273cc3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288274,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elise Bois","original_name":"Elise Bois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f954c3a36808a2ac98d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"portdattachelefilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jRbdQwZHB5W2LPGWuLPtX5d1t50.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Homeport | Laurence Lèvesque","key":"ukwL5Q7o-TQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-12T12:22:29.000Z","id":"5cb2f9889251412fad270e17"}]}}}
