Recorded during their Sucks Blood era in 2007, the performances include songs from previous albums, as well as others that were unreleased at the time. Some of those that had not appeared on any album were later reworked for 2008's The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In, here performed in the more subdued psychedelic folk manner which characterized the band's sound during this period. This album was the final appearance of percussionist Patrick Mullins, who left the band after \"Sucks Blood\".  The live footage on the DVD was filmed over the course of four days in San Francisco.[1] It features the band performing in mostly unconventional locales, such as on the shoulder of a highway and near the beach. The video footage was directed by Brian Lee Hughes.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/fI6iur7G7ip7909ipU0D7kDgKAO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petey Dammit","original_name":"Petey Dammit","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oJLxCJ8NKZcq2QrdNy7zVnwP3fe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb1db5e9251412f9d259f25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigid Dawson","original_name":"Brigid Dawson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y2VXz6FOIpgVi6KbGDr32yTMNi4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb1db7a0e0a2626cac664d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Mullins","original_name":"Patrick Mullins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb1db96c3a3683c2bae975b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dwyer","original_name":"John Dwyer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/islXc6yXkxjOFrLxGRNGfSWrdts.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61f1e4aedf294500e31b40f3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Lee Hughes","original_name":"Brian Lee Hughes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1dbcb0e0a2626e3c68cf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13172916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/73vLoGj8TJsF6A0tv9RJAcuZXzP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fI6iur7G7ip7909ipU0D7kDgKAO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
