Determined to overcome his fear, he resolved to cross the Sahara Desert by camel, training for years to prepare himself for the emotional and physical ordeal. Cole filmed his travels from Mauritania to the Sudan with a 16mm Bolex, capturing the harsh reality of the desert environment with an unflinching intimacy. Cole offers a deeply personal, yet distinctly Western, perspective on the desert as a space of Romantic sublimity.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/zM57t5CCY0bUWQzcaBnHRx7VunC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Without Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Cole","original_name":"Frank Cole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb2bf910e0a2626e3c7ed59","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Cole","original_name":"Frank Cole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2bf859251412fad26bb94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1847627,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francis Miquet","original_name":"Francis Miquet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2bf7dc3a3683c2bb019b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Cole","original_name":"Frank Cole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2bf0d0e0a2626c8c79edc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Cole","original_name":"Frank Cole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2bf680e0a2626cec7cb07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0257865","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zM57t5CCY0bUWQzcaBnHRx7VunC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
