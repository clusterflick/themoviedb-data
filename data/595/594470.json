The resulting film is projected out of focus, creating a lens system that includes the film plane itself. Exploiting the constructive interference of this extra lens, Plane Wave creates a dance of projections visualizing the projector lamp on the screen. The result is color from black and white as the chromatic aberrations create subtle tints of blue, yellow and red at the edges of the pinhole and zoneplate margins. An image of the lamp filaments becomes possible, dependent on the lens/lamp/film and screen distance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plane Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kelly","original_name":"Daniel Kelly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb0a5019251412fb023fb52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
