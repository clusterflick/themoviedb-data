He was said to have a collection of 20,000 videos, with a predilection for action films… from the West of course. One-time director of Arts and Humanities at the Department of Agitation and Propaganda, he wrote in the 1970s an essay on the theoretical practice of how the 7th art should express the ideology in place. Jan Iljäs drew inspiration from the clear principles of the “Shining Star” to create a short film composed of shots taken during a touristic trip to the country.","popularity":0.1613,"poster_path":"/5nwuwck1ZQtdmZF8m1eRJfSw76f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Art of Set Design","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Clamp","original_name":"Rebecca Clamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5cb8ccffc3a3683abf83d438","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2ffee0e0a260ad6c3453b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb300439251411ed6210dd3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb3004bc3a3683c20af9aac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288291,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simojukka Ruippo","original_name":"Simojukka Ruippo","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2ffff9251412fa82748fa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2198061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Svante Colérus","original_name":"Svante Colérus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3eeaf441465c0014c99490","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2053163,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matti Ahopelto","original_name":"Matti Ahopelto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3eeb18ae36680016cb746d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10023540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5nwuwck1ZQtdmZF8m1eRJfSw76f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
