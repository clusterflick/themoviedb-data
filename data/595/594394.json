How to let life make its way out of the maternal womb? How to build a family when you had to leave the motherland? How to keep hope alive when even birds are hiding from bombings? Timelife is a lifeline, an umbilical cord linking each of us, no matter the color of the skin, the mother tongue or the land of birth. Timelife «homebirthes» lives, hopes and love. The narrative takes root in each moment of reality. The truth, extracted from context, is fictionalized. A way of staging life.","popularity":0.0756,"poster_path":"/qHMqZeajnne4Y3FIlxn3E1N2fDl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nunfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timelife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Benamra","original_name":"Stephanie Benamra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccc0cd0925141045126afc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamad Malas","original_name":"Mohamad Malas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccc0cfb0e0a262fcd00e37f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2204969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Christine Darah","original_name":"Marie-Christine Darah","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/hx85utQu6V9g48VS6JgmIGsJ1KO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccc0d3fc3a36836bbdb0f64","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamid Benamra","original_name":"Hamid Benamra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6485125ac9dbf9011dfc2766","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamid Benamra","original_name":"Hamid Benamra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64851255e375c000e24f7831","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10224912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qHMqZeajnne4Y3FIlxn3E1N2fDl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
