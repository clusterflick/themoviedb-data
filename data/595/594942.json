A promise heard too often, a promise we know to be false in advance. Amie-Sarah has fallen deeply in love with Boby, a young Romanian Romani who is living in the street and takes crack. Together, between the Gare de Lyon car park and small Parisian hotels, they have experienced a story of crazy love, which nonetheless has not allowed to change Boby. Because he likes the freedom of the street, where he grew up, the only form of home he knows.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Raeto-Romance","iso_639_1":"rm","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Can Change, But Not 100%","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288277,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antoine Goldet","original_name":"Antoine Goldet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2fa680e0a2626e3c849dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288276,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maïa Barouh","original_name":"Maïa Barouh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2fa599251412fb02740d3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amie-Sarah Barouh","original_name":"Amie-Sarah Barouh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2fa170e0a2626e3c8496e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amie-Sarah Barouh","original_name":"Amie-Sarah Barouh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2fa22c3a3683c22b00294","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022235,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Renaud Duguet","original_name":"Renaud Duguet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2fa2e0e0a260ad6c336d7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amie-Sarah Barouh","original_name":"Amie-Sarah Barouh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2fa0e9251412f9d27252f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
