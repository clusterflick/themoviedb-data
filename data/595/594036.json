Despite the mother's emotional attachment to her absent husband, she has never told the daughter about Jia-Hu so the daughter believes the stepfather is her biological father. But the mother begins to have second thoughts about the stepfather when she sees the teen daughter zealously follow the path paved by him - a path that the mother fears will lead to her daughter's moral decline.","popularity":0.1654,"poster_path":"/hiK7KJKeG05Xv6ObvlPT4lK3jzr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116952,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Photoplay Service","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Light of Maternal Instinct","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Yan-yan","original_name":"Chen Yan-yan","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":"/oxO5pgyrruBNm8ajovhc8GY8UEC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lin Shao-Mei","credit_id":"5cae15c59251412fa820711f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Yan","original_name":"Jin Yan","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/yNHIiwthTf6r8RGY1G4mTcXWjh0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jia-Hu","credit_id":"5cae15f30e0a2626d3c0bd91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1588070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lai Cheuk-Cheuk","original_name":"Lai Cheuk-Cheuk","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hui-Ying","credit_id":"5cae166b9251412fa62076de","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bu Wan-Cang","original_name":"Bu Wan-Cang","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/6kzDWCefQn8aSHhZJtdOAFUYyoD.jpg","credit_id":"5cae16fa0e0a2626c8c0c3ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2285640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guang Ren","original_name":"Guang Ren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/35GSQIQhNd8NenaNcxBnQyesKn4.jpg","credit_id":"5cae171c0e0a2626c5c0c03b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285641,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wong Siao Fen","original_name":"Wong Siao Fen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cae1738c3a3683c26a8aea3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bu Wan-Cang","original_name":"Bu Wan-Cang","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/6kzDWCefQn8aSHhZJtdOAFUYyoD.jpg","credit_id":"5cae16e90e0a2626e9c0bf9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192337","wikidata_id":"Q56291347","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hiK7KJKeG05Xv6ObvlPT4lK3jzr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
