The problem is, how can you plan, work and survive in a world driven by ruthless competition? One day at a time, for instance. In a world ruled by profit and dominated by the exploitation of the weaker ones, the film literally offers an alternative set of ways about how to think our future and the means and tools to work for it. It is not an easy job but, as Taste of Hope carefully and precisely shows, there is still a lot that can be done if we change our relationship to production and labor. Instead of making grand gestures or political statements, the filmmaker works with the camera and with a thoughtful editing in order to understand how to weave together new possibilities of communal existence.","popularity":0.0677,"poster_path":"/c9g6M1Nob9xZ8JwX2CzEL8OSBkY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Srikandi Films","origin_country":""},{"id":154939,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Fabrique des écritures / Centre Norbert Elias","origin_country":""},{"id":154940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universität Bern","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taste of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Coppens","original_name":"Laura Coppens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1f2f6c3a36808a2ab2c87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Coppens","original_name":"Laura Coppens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1f2ff0e0a2626e9c65640","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287746,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Azadeh Zandieh","original_name":"Azadeh Zandieh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1f3110e0a2626e3c6b35b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelika Levi","original_name":"Angelika Levi","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/kqX9dEN7dxriv5NhQWkS18WijoH.jpg","credit_id":"5cb1f32e9251412fb025c130","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Coppens","original_name":"Laura Coppens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1f34cc3a3683c24ae57bb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287746,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Azadeh Zandieh","original_name":"Azadeh Zandieh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1f357c3a3683c2baec357","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Coppens","original_name":"Laura Coppens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb1f3600e0a2626e3c6b3c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12004202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"tasteofhopefilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1181,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c9g6M1Nob9xZ8JwX2CzEL8OSBkY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":836},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1060,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oYaLn56tRGAprQ4YzQ9zPp3jG7G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2550,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v97sI5s5Y9EgyhIi3CNZbyz0TNn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
