Many of the refugees came from Syria and Iraq, and their journeys to safety were physically and mentally taxing. To tell the story of their experience, Academy Award®-winning director Barbara Kopple uses a unique and creative setting: summer camp. Located on a small island in the Canadian wilderness, Camp Pathfinder has given boys from Canada and the U.S. a place to belong for over a century. A few years ago, its director—saddened and disturbed by what he was seeing in the news—decided to give refugees the opportunity to attend the camp. Kopple’s film chronicles their stay, beautifully capturing the bonds of new friendship. But not all the boys are able to escape the mindset of war. Through the eyes of these youngsters, NEW HOMELAND documents the highs and lows of starting over.","popularity":0.0993,"poster_path":"/yuOy1RhE4zcJsMqBOgmmw2VdSAU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7942,"logo_path":"/jcPtOtTkjEhvdJE6libr8ReqUch.png","name":"Cabin Creek Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14725,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Amram","original_name":"David Amram","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/k8so8MBDj4g7fNfeF2HVW6ayEO0.jpg","credit_id":"605d03df988afd003c4b0153","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201084,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary Keith Griffin","original_name":"Gary Keith Griffin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d03ee8f26bc003f619ba4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1741047,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Cassidy","original_name":"David Cassidy","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d02bafed597003d81dc0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3025144,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Forman","original_name":"Eric Forman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d03cf8f26bc0055990488","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637932,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Asad Faruqi","original_name":"Asad Faruqi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d03e6fed597003d81de36","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Kopple","original_name":"Barbara Kopple","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/6B3IxVoE11KPCEKS1VllDSZ374c.jpg","credit_id":"605d03d6988afd0028e36fd7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286590,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amina Megalli","original_name":"Amina Megalli","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cafc6019251412fb022ddc3","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Kopple","original_name":"Barbara Kopple","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/6B3IxVoE11KPCEKS1VllDSZ374c.jpg","credit_id":"5cafc55d9251412fa022dfb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276671,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rob Kuhns","original_name":"Rob Kuhns","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cafc5d3925141776120f5dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9177092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yuOy1RhE4zcJsMqBOgmmw2VdSAU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOC NYC","release_date":"2018-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
