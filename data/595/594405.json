He was called Oussama. Twenty years later, his name appears in the credits of Return to Homs by Talal Derki, programmed in Istanbul. The childhood friend has become “the man with the camera”, a “media activist” documenting the demonstrations and their repression by the Assad regime, until his arrest in 2012. The filmmaker sets off in search of the man whose name features on the list of the 70,000 forced disappearances that have occurred since the beginning of the conflict.","popularity":0.1289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for the Man with the Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boutheyna Bouslama","original_name":"Boutheyna Bouslama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04bcb0e0a2626cac42379","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boutheyna Bouslama","original_name":"Boutheyna Bouslama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04bd30e0a2626e3c42fc7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286849,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hakan Iğsız","original_name":"Hakan Iğsız","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04bee9251412fa3238c78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boutheyna Bouslama","original_name":"Boutheyna Bouslama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04c09c3a3683c2bac1e2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giuliano Papacchioli","original_name":"Giuliano Papacchioli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04c170e0a2626cec429e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286852,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Murat Öztürk","original_name":"Murat Öztürk","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04c3b0e0a2626c8c40c2d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286853,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barış Güvenenler","original_name":"Barış Güvenenler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04c690e0a2626e9c40a3f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286854,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Farid Rezkallah","original_name":"Farid Rezkallah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04c8e0e0a2626d3c3fd51","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1528539,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joëlle Bertossa","original_name":"Joëlle Bertossa","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb04cd90e0a2626cac4246c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Looking for the Man with the Camera | Boutheyna Bouslama","key":"W2GTaeK79Cw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-11T09:01:45.000Z","id":"5cb04d0a0e0a2626c8c40cac"}]}}}
