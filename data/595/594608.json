For four years, from 2006-2009, filmmaker Martin Bell and photographer Mary Ellen Mark travelled around the country and documented proms.  They went to twelve high schools in 10 cities, covering a wide range of ethnic and economic groups.  While Mary Ellen Mark made portraits of the Prom-goers with the 20x24 Polaroid camera, Martin Bell interviewed the students in an adjacent studio.  When the project finally came to a close, Bell had interviewed over three hundred students.","popularity":0.1105,"poster_path":"/aCzZtjcqIES9kBKEzgG7UuGybGW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Bell","original_name":"Martin Bell","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/iDcZNf1opK4l8FReBPEFCAGvIEH.jpg","credit_id":"5cb1769e0e0a2626c8c5b3bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Bell","original_name":"Martin Bell","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/iDcZNf1opK4l8FReBPEFCAGvIEH.jpg","credit_id":"67eba81803babdced27ab147","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mary Ellen Mark","original_name":"Mary Ellen Mark","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/8xLyvZX5RpUwfCWI4OsvQAexVOr.jpg","credit_id":"67eba83203babdced27ab156","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1543693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aCzZtjcqIES9kBKEzgG7UuGybGW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
