In the thrill of curiosity, and a chance to escape her mundane relationship, Ella pulls the zipper to reveal Jurgen lying underneath. Jurgen is the antithesis of Tsiki, and Ella finds temporary happiness in the change he brings to her life. However, as the bliss of new love fades, so too does Ella's sense of fulfillment. She pulls Tsiki's skin from its hiding place in the kitchen and longs for the man she cast aside. She sinks in the realization that happiness cannot be manifested in others; the change must come from within.To her surprise, Ella soon discovers a zipper under her own tongue. As she stares at herself in the mirror, she contemplates the difficult decision of whether or not to pull.","popularity":0.4569,"poster_path":"/wn6oLU3ENQFok7lWc91xgxJL7iz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unzipping","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Edelstein","original_name":"Lisa Edelstein","popularity":1.7829,"profile_path":"/wWNU2koV7qksXLtXDtbuGcbnfa1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ella","credit_id":"5d69535ab7fbbd4994128a97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Le Gros","original_name":"James Le Gros","popularity":0.9144,"profile_path":"/q7AgI7xjFDSQPlilkT17YddAc93.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tsiki","credit_id":"5d69536cca83540013f77d46","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Lewis","original_name":"Jason Lewis","popularity":0.9276,"profile_path":"/dBDH5PJGEmvMAVqlWe8sVAneDkt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jurgen","credit_id":"5d69537bfe077a001199ce9f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Edelstein","original_name":"Lisa Edelstein","popularity":1.7829,"profile_path":"/wWNU2koV7qksXLtXDtbuGcbnfa1.jpg","credit_id":"5d6953936f43ec3798740e1f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Edelstein","original_name":"Lisa Edelstein","popularity":1.7829,"profile_path":"/wWNU2koV7qksXLtXDtbuGcbnfa1.jpg","credit_id":"5d69533db7fbbd3b3512a918","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7847764","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wn6oLU3ENQFok7lWc91xgxJL7iz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
