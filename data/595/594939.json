From now on dreaming is forbidden in his realm, and art and culture have to suffer as well. Then the dreamers revolt. Animation based on a story by Belcampo from 1934 offers rudimentary animation, combined with stock footage and film clips. The result is a rich and playful film, with a lot of affection for imagination.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pJUr3bdfKUmutGkhDFw2Uj7s1HC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Driesprong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sjeng Schupp","original_name":"Sjeng Schupp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f84f9251412fb3275d6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michiel van Dijk","original_name":"Michiel van Dijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2f85a0e0a260ad6c33311","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJUr3bdfKUmutGkhDFw2Uj7s1HC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
