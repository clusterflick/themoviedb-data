She ran away from home after her parents forbade her to marry Sharnokhoi. Garalma is pregnant. Suddenly on a way home she sees a strange man in a busy city street through the window of the bus – a horseman wearing the ancient armor of the Huns, riding a black horse and carrying weapons. Garalma feels sick, doctors from the local hospital can’t make an accurate diagnosis of her condition and keep making tests and giving her strong sedative injections every few hours. Sharnokhoi meets another patient of the hospital, an old Buryat man who tries to explain to Sharnokhoi that the doctors cannot help his wife and that if he wants to save her a special shaman ceremony should be performed.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8nDWDnI18n6WsZ65AfdS2akjTZV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buryatkino","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sharnokhoi: The Yellow Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Шарнохой — жёлтый пес","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Шарнохой — желтый пёс","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Шарнохой — жёлтый пёс","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sharnokhoy — zheltyy pes","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sharnokhoy — zhyoltyy pes","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sharnokhoy — zheltyy pyos","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sharnokhoy — zhyoltyy pyos","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sharnokhoy - Zholtyy Pos","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sharnokhai, The Yellow Dog","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bair Protasov","original_name":"Bair Protasov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccab2ac0e0a262fb3feb3e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2302354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayarma Boboeva","original_name":"Bayarma Boboeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccab2d80e0a262fb8feaa88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2302356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sayana Tsydypova","original_name":"Sayana Tsydypova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccab30b925141045624bde1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolay Soktoev","original_name":"Nikolay Soktoev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccab329c3a36836add8c1d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chimit Dondokov","original_name":"Chimit Dondokov","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ccab3490e0a262fc5feaee4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Battulga Galmandah","original_name":"Battulga Galmandah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccab261925141044e24ae7b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2286955,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gleb Stepanov","original_name":"Gleb Stepanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccab2460e0a262fb3feb392","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bair Dyshenov","original_name":"Bair Dyshenov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccab294925141045d24c5f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bair Dyshenov","original_name":"Bair Dyshenov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccab22c925141045624bc54","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bair Dyshenov","original_name":"Bair Dyshenov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccab202925141047d24b611","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9879106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ue1OpQlDyTCSMtkJ96Gfx0Se5Xv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/8nDWDnI18n6WsZ65AfdS2akjTZV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":514}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
