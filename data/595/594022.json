Many of them have alcoholic parents and some are in danger of going down the same path. They speak openly about the past and their hopes for a better life. The documentary follows the young men and women within the group and in search of personal space. A party to start the summer holidays marks not only the end of the school year – it also means that an entire class will be taking leave of the home forever.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/zdCPmbkNHbjfqk2nQF90mkjmZUk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelika Andrees","original_name":"Angelika Andrees","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cadf6180e0a2630ff5a9630","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelika Andrees","original_name":"Angelika Andrees","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d36a0c6ab6849000f8495e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2368841,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Julia Kunert","original_name":"Julia Kunert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d36a0feab684900128491f4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d36a10560c51d00138127db","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1096601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petra Tschörtner","original_name":"Petra Tschörtner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d36a121ab6849000f84967f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelika Andrees","original_name":"Angelika Andrees","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d36a12b60c51d00108127b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10157630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":759,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zdCPmbkNHbjfqk2nQF90mkjmZUk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
