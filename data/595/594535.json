They soon discover they are not alone. Stalking the woods is Hammerhead, a ruthless human hunter who hibernates with the 17 year cycle of the local cicada bugs. The girls only hope for survival rests in the revenging hands of Killian, hellbent on finding the predator that took his sister's life. Three stranded Vacationers, an avenging brother out to settle the score at any cost, and Hammerhead - will the nightmare end - or merely hibernate for another 17 years.","popularity":0.1907,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hammerhead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Blood Ties: The Legend of Hammerhead","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Newman","original_name":"Amber Newman","popularity":0.6934,"profile_path":"/xSGMle8jJ3aAfeuBeqsyiEPvtqV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Becca","credit_id":"5cb10c2fc3a3683c24ad0fe7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Collard","original_name":"Christopher Collard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Killian","credit_id":"5cb10c5ec3a3683c2bad53d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3464515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Ballentine","original_name":"Kristen Ballentine","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"622e52882866fa001b4f6791","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3464516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Barclay","original_name":"Marie Barclay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Monica","credit_id":"622e528f9d2b630078935544","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Leigh Davis","original_name":"Heather Leigh Davis","popularity":0.0372,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"622e52969d2b63001bd42aeb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2437049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy R.
