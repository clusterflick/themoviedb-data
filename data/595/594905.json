For filmmaker Donna McRae, the show was a crucial part of getting through a lonely childhood. McRae seeks people that made the show, Cobby's zoo friends, zoo keepers and the animal rights activists that help her piece together the story of an animal stolen from his natural habitat to work on TV before, being retired into the San Francisco Zoo at age 7. Most primates chimps in entertainment suffered horrifically, becoming research animals or caged in roadside zoos. This documentary examines how we perceive animals in entertainment and how we address their plight now.","popularity":0.2335,"poster_path":"/mXUEoxZ15xoYSykwleTxtRijDOd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97333,"logo_path":null,"name":"mcraeandvale","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cuteness has a use-by date.","title":"Cobby: The Other Side of Cute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cobby","original_name":"Cobby","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb2d1670e0a2626c8c7b9b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna McRae","original_name":"Donna McRae","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cb2d1739251412fb3272548","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923211,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Vale","original_name":"Michael Vale","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2d198c3a3680891ac755e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna McRae","original_name":"Donna McRae","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb2d1889251412fa826fe83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8031742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Cobby-The-Other-Side-of-Cute-604623722909981","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/GYpDoifCh0iQSfeTB5GGPar6Ql.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dnTEhrPbUElzRXximezS9fJPCqX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2370,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mXUEoxZ15xoYSykwleTxtRijDOd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9898,"name":"animal rights"},{"id":253541,"name":"anti-vivisection"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"SF DocFest 2018","release_date":"2018-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
