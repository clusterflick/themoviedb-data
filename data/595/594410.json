Besides her search for financing and partners, her personal conflicts, she gives advice to distraught mothers, coaches young people and tries to provide them with support in their integration process. «A heroine's quest» paints the portrait of a strong woman, who has come to accept that progress can only be made in tiny baby steps, but at the end of the day, it's all about making life together a bit better. A portrait of an everyday heroine. An impression of the Muslim community in the fight against prejudice.","popularity":0.2533,"poster_path":"/nkWQkWcrYMOoIT7ll7GIVYkP6C5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105717,"logo_path":"/1LkTbQqXVc0bE8s1Lsvw7hVETTN.png","name":"Lomotion","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naïma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naima Serroukh","original_name":"Naima Serroukh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5fca2e1e41aac4004272c27b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2286869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Milosevic","original_name":"Tamara Milosevic","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb0528bc3a3683c22abf107","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2286869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Milosevic","original_name":"Tamara Milosevic","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb052a49251412fa32393d9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240704,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadja Gubser","original_name":"Nadja Gubser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb0532a9251412fb323a646","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286876,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Konstantin Gutscher","original_name":"Konstantin Gutscher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb053679251412fa82383d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286879,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ilja Coric","original_name":"Ilja Coric","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb053839251412fa323951f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Fonjallaz","original_name":"David Fonjallaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sildnIdElEnMisJFuJ3Rv9J5lqz.jpg","credit_id":"5cb0539b9251412fa0238c97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277331,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louis Mataré","original_name":"Louis Mataré","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1IpfgUOp4T4F06iaLUirgQhU0pr.jpg","credit_id":"5cb053b6c3a3683c24abf2a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65063,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Urs Augstburger","original_name":"Urs Augstburger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb053dac3a3683c26abd5e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881026,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roger Sommer","original_name":"Roger Sommer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fca2a728261ee003f3ec711","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Felix Bussmann","original_name":"Felix Bussmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fca2afc41aac4004172666c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272093,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramon Giger","original_name":"Ramon Giger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff45e26549dda00409b96fb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10153494","wikidata_id":"Q100936490","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8lWl8EldsrY2Yen41e5i9XCYMVn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ahwrP2IidHfDowAbd7MClJfYz2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8d11vJR5JkhCInxmK5u5n7ZqLi5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1192,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkWQkWcrYMOoIT7ll7GIVYkP6C5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":844}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NAIMA  (2019) Official Trailer","key":"g3DidnqFwM4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-04-01T11:39:33.000Z","id":"5fca2f1e43999b003d167fdc"}]}}}
