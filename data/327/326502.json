Set amid WWII, TREASURE ISLAND follows two American code specialists that are hard at work trying to decipher Japanese messages and sending confusing messages back to deceive the enemy.  The film explores sexual themes that were prevalent during the period, but not shown in the movies of that era. Frank, a bigamist, is married to two women and is pursuing a third wife. Samuel and his wife Penny are in a ménage à trois, which he participates in to cover up his homosexuality. As the pressures of the men’s lives begin to eat away at them, the dead body starts to torment Frank and Samuel's subconscious, interacting with the private stories of their lives.","popularity":1.7483,"poster_path":"/7m6wHzahnjjRFVGu4Gug9FwznVp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You've Never Seen Anything Like Treasure Island!","title":"Treasure Island","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Offerman","original_name":"Nick Offerman","popularity":1.5458,"profile_path":"/zhmWZEJkzqgkIbSqZmFtUm0AwUV.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Samuel","credit_id":"54e7cee39251412eb10008a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":191637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Baker","original_name":"Lance Baker","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/soOKtIFN4KTD0touhfWmu7t0sny.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"5682c6cc925141133400c211","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonah Blechman","original_name":"Jonah Blechman","popularity":0.1928,"profile_path":"/ngp1PfWI3cqwhEALZDDJVFxhdbH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Body","credit_id":"5a579180c3a36825a800097a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Healy","original_name":"Pat Healy","popularity":0.454,"profile_path":"/eHTM7VOGeeVQDdGmodL24aN89YL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clark","credit_id":"5a579192c3a36825cd000819","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzy Nakamura","original_name":"Suzy Nakamura","popularity":0.7752,"profile_path":"/AkPYH6DKr0Bhv9kA2PTSGjpi11P.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Yo-Ji","credit_id":"5a5791b2c3a36825ab000943","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Singer","original_name":"Rachel Singer","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/o4Hzvy1VRa3IILMrI45Ia08pstK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"5a5791c09251413af60008b2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caveh Zahedi","original_name":"Caveh Zahedi","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/lT0XuaVmnAIx9JY30giirlKOTBn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Harold","credit_id":"5a5791d80e0a2669cb000a3a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Byington","original_name":"Bob Byington","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/ky6zMMg4VazqRC8VAPF596vKA3Y.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"5a579224c3a36825b600098a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guinevere Turner","original_name":"Guinevere Turner","popularity":0.3469,"profile_path":"/1j0RtYIayM7LOsT8bispVHsKBia.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Evelyn","credit_id":"5a5792369251413aea000a66","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gutrecht","original_name":"Paul Gutrecht","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":37,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffc37a40c1255003ff4fdfc","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Donovan","original_name":"Jamie Donovan","popularity":0.3644,"profile_path":"/As68gyMwkLPJMaXX8LdbE58tczt.jpg","cast_id":38,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffc37bbfab3fa003c4ec0cd","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.P.
