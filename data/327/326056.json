A man named Joe drives his Land Rover into a remote field. The purpose of his trip is obscure. Is he scouting a location? Has he been sent by someone to check out the area? His cell phone rings and a stranger's voice tells him to look in the back of his car. He does, and discovers the dead body of a young girl who's gone missing. The voice on the phone tells him he's been set up, that no one will believe him, and that he'd better follow instructions and bury the body. As he complies, his headaches worsen. Is there any way out for Joe?","popularity":0.8422,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schneider's 2nd Stage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Branagh","original_name":"Kenneth Branagh","popularity":2.3128,"profile_path":"/AbCqqFxNi5w3nDUFdQt0DGMFh5H.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Joseph Barnett","credit_id":"54e4c9549251411099005e82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Horan","original_name":"Gerard Horan","popularity":0.4788,"profile_path":"/crvohW6KrgAZUgoBE8IwKN5ErxQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Detective Sergeant","credit_id":"54e4c9669251412c8e005609","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Woolley","original_name":"Fiona Woolley","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Girl in Car","credit_id":"54e4c9a4925141454f009298","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Stoole","original_name":"Tim Stoole","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Crime Scene Investigator","credit_id":"54e4c9b99251417add0031da","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence Pritchard","original_name":"Terence Pritchard","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Crime Scene Investigator","credit_id":"54e4c9cfc3a36823d4002d8b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dei Enos","original_name":"Dei Enos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Crime Scene Investigator","credit_id":"54e4c9e1c3a368454b00a92f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Yuill","original_name":"Jimmy Yuill","popularity":0.211,"profile_path":"/oHsqdz8ImfAQfTnNKNTan0sxa9e.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Detective Chief Inspector","credit_id":"562ea202c3a3681b5e00b3ab","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Stoole","original_name":"Phil Stoole","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e4ca4fc3a368486f0033bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Stoole","original_name":"Phil Stoole","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e4ca79925141454f0092b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Stoole","original_name":"Phil Stoole","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e4ca6f9251417add0031ed","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0331629","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
