His three children; Velvet, Cassius, and Azalea exist around him as they reel from the loss of their mother who is never mentioned in the film. To bury his own pain, Evan takes to sleeping with young women, and vacillates between extremely affectionate behavior toward his children and blatant neglect. After bearing witness to a particularly stinging example of their fatherâ€™s womanizing with a girl named Sarah who arrives as a potential client to Evan, the children decide take matters into their own hands and rid the Snow house of Sarah and any other women that threaten to alter their peculiar yet functional family dynamic.","popularity":0.158,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The History of Caves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Charnoski","original_name":"Rick Charnoski","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Evan Snow","credit_id":"54e4dec3c3a368087b00565f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadie Wilking","original_name":"Sadie Wilking","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Velvet Snow","credit_id":"54e4ded9925141469f009cf9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lux Lennox","original_name":"Lux Lennox","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cassius Snow","credit_id":"54e4deecc3a36848970038d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Azalea Chapman","original_name":"Azalea Chapman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Azalea Snow","credit_id":"54e4df079251411099006040","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1428644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Mae Sunday","original_name":"Lucy Mae Sunday","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"54e4df22925141195300b52c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alyson Kennon","original_name":"Alyson Kennon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Girl in the Red Light","credit_id":"54e4df5c9251417add003372","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Rose Thompson","original_name":"Lola Rose Thompson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Virginia","credit_id":"54e4df64925141469f009d0c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emma Tillman","original_name":"Emma Tillman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e4de15925141195a00bb23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emma Tillman","original_name":"Emma Tillman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e4de1cc3a368654c001768","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jaime Dukehart","original_name":"Jaime Dukehart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e4df8fc3a36848970038e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428648,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Adrianna Iantorno","original_name":"Adrianna Iantorno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e4df9cc3a368486f00356e","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christopher Blauvelt","original_name":"Christopher Blauvelt","popularity":0.1684,"profile_path":"/aY73Z8Vv8r1LgD3DYJz4kEJvryy.jpg","credit_id":"55abe863c3a3682d630051da","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The History of Caves [FILM TRAILER] - Soundtrack by Josh Tillman (aka Father John Misty)","key":"6QitdDfeitE","published_at":"2013-11-13T18:31:57.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54e4e086c3a368575600abc0"}]}}}
