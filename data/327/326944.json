Wintour's insider account of this epic tale of faith, fanaticism, persecution and betrayal is told in detail, from his recruitment of both Fawkes and his own brother to his capture in a dramatic siege and bloody shoot-out on 8 November.  The hopes, fears and plans for a Midlands rebellion, royal kidnap, the plotters' penetration of the king's bodyguard and Fawkes' attendance, sword in hand, at a wedding attended by the king in December 1604 are shown, as well as a dramatisation of the thrilling, forgotten story of the final days after 5/11 as the conspirators are hunted down and then face the terrible punishments reserved for traitors.","popularity":0.8982,"poster_path":"/pErpZDHpHTDuMrwB71zjyAIyqxN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/cey5EAFwOb7AfDOsQ4p4q5MixzX.png","name":"BBC Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":135559,"logo_path":null,"name":"AENON","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gunpowder 5/11: The Greatest Terror Plot","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Thomas King","original_name":"Jamie Thomas King","popularity":0.2295,"profile_path":"/hE7R5CcybeolLiptWVvPnOkittU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Thomas Wintour","credit_id":"59624c3d925141790403ecc4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lintern","original_name":"Richard Lintern","popularity":0.718,"profile_path":"/qYfmDezPYguD45T3fKulyB8tHUv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself - Narrator","credit_id":"5d6cfd3765686e6d7d896b1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Maclachlan","original_name":"Jamie Maclachlan","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/oE0O4BjDMwD4j4EBedS0eOvhcv0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Guy Fawkes","credit_id":"59624c549251410bfa0ddee4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Kennedy","original_name":"Joseph Kennedy","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Robert Catesby","credit_id":"59624c71925141790403ecff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Aitken","original_name":"Charles Aitken","popularity":0.2752,"profile_path":"/96viVHXRXd76fUYhUufq1JTjX0T.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Robert Winter","credit_id":"59624c87c3a36825e80c9665","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Drury","original_name":"Ken Drury","popularity":0.2174,"profile_path":"/3myNXv3aZS779ZJWBsCGrHNdOGG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Re Giacomo","credit_id":"59624c9e9251410c560d0979","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223033,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Kemp","original_name":"Adam Kemp","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59624c05c3a36828a10eefac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223033,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Kemp","original_name":"Adam Kemp","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59624bef92514122510b9568","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018539,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jody Jenkins","original_name":"Jody Jenkins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59624c1cc3a368293b0e0d4c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223033,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Kemp","original_name":"Adam Kemp","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59624bdf9251410bfa0dde6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3638696","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pErpZDHpHTDuMrwB71zjyAIyqxN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
