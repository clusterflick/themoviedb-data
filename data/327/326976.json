Pitchfork has gathered raw concert footage and interview with Rodgers, Bob Sinclar, Dave Haslam and the man himself (who chalks-up his fascination with electric music numbers to seeing Jimi Hendrix perform live in Paris as a teenager) to delve into the mans incalculable contribution to the DNAs of dance floor freakers and pop music alike (sampling years before it was adopted as hip-hop’s hammer and nail) and how he came to be so cherished by the greater funk cannon.","popularity":0.4061,"poster_path":"/aDi2MFKqfnnB8TiRlghQJSnr6br.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pitchfork.tv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cerrone","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Cerrone","original_name":"Marc Cerrone","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/6BNwMxmqdEKM0AqEEtdL1D5hWNb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54ebab31c3a36866fe0002ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nile Rodgers","original_name":"Nile Rodgers","popularity":0.21,"profile_path":"/g3ApsaEiNiuwL1k51xIXwOgvQiE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54ebab38c3a368676d0002d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1430849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Sinclar","original_name":"Bob Sinclar","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/4Sl9Xj3L6LpsgHk3FNsVb2smVhX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54ebab3e92514113b5000264","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Haslam","original_name":"Dave Haslam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54ebab47925141117e0002c1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitri Pailhe","original_name":"Dimitri Pailhe","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ebab25c3a36866fe0002cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aDi2MFKqfnnB8TiRlghQJSnr6br.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1267}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155490,"name":"disco"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cerrone (A Documentary) - Pitchfork TV","key":"8sbJ-oZmkrw","published_at":"2015-02-23T14:59:14.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"54ebabd992514113b500026e"}]}}}
