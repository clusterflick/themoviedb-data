It's a serious, yet often humorous cross between Chris Rock's \"Good Hair\" and Bill Duke/D. Channsin Berry's \"Dark Girls\" documentaries with some sensitive Oprah styled interviews mixed in.  The film explores the risks posed by chemical straighteners and skin bleaching, it shares insights on conditions like Vitiligo and Alopecia whilst discussing the impact of biased media on children and personal relationships.  Backed by a global campaign to challenge governments and the pharmaceutical industry, this is edutainment that may just change your life.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46980,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ligali","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beauty Is...
