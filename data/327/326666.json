Director Nakamura Ryugo was born in 1996. He made this film, his feature debut, when he was just fourteen years old. Okinawa has an old tradition of eating a goat for celebratory occasions. But that culture is starting to fade in urban areas. Yuto (Uehara Soji), a sixth grader living in Naha, spends his winter vacation in the countryside town where his grandparents reside. He receives a shock when he sees the goat raised by his grandfather killed by locals.","popularity":0.1247,"poster_path":"/wIMFVGkUnVCc78y5FcEeGpBaEFF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Catcher On The Shore","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Yagi No Bouken","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seima Gima","original_name":"Seima Gima","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54e90a51c3a36836dc0028fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susumu Taira","original_name":"Susumu Taira","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54e90a619251412eb400276b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soji Uehara","original_name":"Soji Uehara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54e90a709251412eb4002770","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1414849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taeko Yoshida","original_name":"吉田妙子","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54e90a829251412eae002904","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryugo Nakamura","original_name":"仲村颯悟","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e90a13c3a36836d90026cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1803230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2722,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wIMFVGkUnVCc78y5FcEeGpBaEFF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1927}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8676,"name":"okinawa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"映画『やぎの冒険』予告編","key":"bljVGLn456Q","published_at":"2010-12-02T06:55:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5a940a3dc3a36824fd033eb1"}]}}}
