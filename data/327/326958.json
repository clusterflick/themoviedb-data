By contrast Drew, Tom's old army pal, is a footloose bachelor currently running a car-hire firm owned by his rich uncle, who lives in Canada. Since Drew's uncle makes it clear that his nephew will only inherit the business when he's a respectable married man, his upcoming visit throws Drew into a panic. Having taken a fancy to the vivacious Jenny, Drew persuades her to masquerade as his wife â€“ an arrangement that leads the trio into some highly complicated situations!","popularity":0.8098,"poster_path":"/aqjWadRW36zSa2OhqM8rZFGKw6q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":632,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Lion Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1961-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part-Time Wife","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Rodgers","original_name":"Anton Rodgers","popularity":0.3917,"profile_path":"/upQTPhKd5YU0ZMOnHmZxEjqYdDo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tom Briggs","credit_id":"54eb8dafc3a368676d00002b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":138166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nyree Dawn Porter","original_name":"Nyree Dawn Porter","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":"/hp7e6IboqMS0DGMWLdhiBYV6Mss.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jenny Briggs","credit_id":"54eb8db99251411516000013","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth J.
