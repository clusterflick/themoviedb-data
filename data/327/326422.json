There he developed a revolutionary hybrid automobile that was never produced. After a love affair with an African-American dancer in Los Angeles he lived in Tokyo at the end of the 1950s as a recluse and learned Japanese. He spent the last 30 years of his life alone on Hawaii. Despite many opportunities to fulfil his dreams of freedom, success and security, he can never quite set himself free from Switzerland, his mother and his self-reproach and misses the chance to find happiness. Walter's nephew, director Tobias Wyss, tells the story of his uncle in a personal manner, making use of moving photographs and videos from the family archive. The Zurich director reconstructs the contradictory biography of his uncle in seven episodes.","popularity":0.1215,"poster_path":"/7Zxsp5GUVBm5Y72N47cA5Yd3ile.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52966,"logo_path":"/cd4lBKeO8zcp4ZLTAMCsijXQAuh.png","name":"Mira Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flying Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510820,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tobias Wyss","original_name":"Tobias Wyss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b591f61bac4007e7040e7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510820,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tobias Wyss","original_name":"Tobias Wyss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b58d0a3b5e60091f60ccb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Zwierko","original_name":"Peter Zwierko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b598939b6c3007e0cdbb8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510820,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tobias Wyss","original_name":"Tobias Wyss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b58daef9d72009219dfb9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382676,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jürg von Allmen","original_name":"Jürg von Allmen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b5942fdc14600928360be","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Becker","original_name":"Patrick Becker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b59764b6d9d0083f950f9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2521647,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mirjam Krakenberger","original_name":"Mirjam Krakenberger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b593139b6c3007e0cdb9f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710183,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andreas Birkle","original_name":"Andreas Birkle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b59106ca9a0008297af3b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hercli Bundi","original_name":"Hercli Bundi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b58f96af9dd007fc71e52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487524,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Almada","original_name":"Daniel Almada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b59589f5dfb007e19f6e3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2917178,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Severin Kuhn","original_name":"Severin Kuhn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b59ab9f5dfb007e19f701","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Compositing Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1863241","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1072,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gtRqEGgfVGSde9hHkXRRkcbcPFz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1906}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Zxsp5GUVBm5Y72N47cA5Yd3ile.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
