On the contrary, he drags along languidly from one lesson by Eben Bonabben, his wise tutor, to another. Today, it cannot be denied that Ahmed is very learned: he knows everything about everything, including talking with birds. No, not everything mind you. There is ONE realm that is not his: the kingdom of the heart. The reason is obvious, although unknown to the prince himself. On the day of his birth, the astrologers of the court predicted that terrible disasters would arise if Ahmed should ever find love.","popularity":0.1798,"poster_path":"/bhK4HnljtGeyM11KEO8l6sR6Stf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1998-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ahmed, The Prince of the Alhambra","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juanba Berasategi","original_name":"Juanba Berasategi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7c84890355c64576e41fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215479","wikidata_id":"Q2827472","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":727,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wi7xslKXTvfhtFdJ6fZcmR7t7YB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1291},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mTTnMFfXElyn1IsF1kkzVXKh6c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/laGt6kKKWQOsiRdMa7Vt3397wiA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bhK4HnljtGeyM11KEO8l6sR6Stf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"7","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
