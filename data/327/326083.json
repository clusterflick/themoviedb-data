The environmental, climate, public health, ethical, and human impacts are enormous and remain largely undocumented. WHAT'S FOR DINNER? explores this terrain in fast-globalizing China through the eyes of a retired pig farmer in rural Jiangxi province; a vegan restaurateur in Beijing; a bullish young livestock entrepreneur; and residents of the province known as the 'world's factory' contending with water polluted by wastes from pig factory farms. They personalize the vast trends around them, in a country on the cusp of becoming a world power. Given that every fifth person in the world is Chinese, what the Chinese eat and how China produces its food, affects not only China, but the world, too.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/uZeHgaXRcfvorGlFoObAosCyPoE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's For Dinner?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yi Jian","original_name":"Yi Jian","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b03b149c3a3686c9902fbe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1813749","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1136,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZeHgaXRcfvorGlFoObAosCyPoE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":770}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"DC Environmental Film Festival ","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
