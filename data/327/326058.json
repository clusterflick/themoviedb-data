He needs cash fast, and after being unable to find a job, Lucy reluctantly accepts the too-good-to-be-true position as a housekeeper offered to her through a friend of a friend. For only three weeks work, she will be paid enough to get Sal out of trouble. Things start to take a disturbing turn, however, as the job reveals itself to be anything but normal. Her never-seen employer seems to have a dark side, and Lucy's own haunted past begins to reappear, tormenting her. As the job spirals out of control and Sal's life hangs in the balance, Lucy's grip on reality disappears.","popularity":0.1127,"poster_path":"/iutgRafq70CVnLPXK2sG8F1Dhzg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Housekeeping","video":false,"vote_average":6.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Solis","original_name":"Adriana Solis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"551b0d51c3a368767000091d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Wojcik","original_name":"Blair Wojcik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lindsay","credit_id":"551b0d909251414ae6000911","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Percich","original_name":"Monica Percich","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Denise","credit_id":"551b0dc99251414aed000897","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Foglia","original_name":"Carlos Foglia","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sal","credit_id":"551b0dd7c3a368767000092f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Schlechter","original_name":"Peter Schlechter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Detective","credit_id":"551b0de49251414af6000943","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Harrington","original_name":"Jennifer Harrington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wIMsdFjRljUe7lyIvlnzHhARpYd.jpg","credit_id":"5596530e925141631700372a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1368237,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tara Anaïse","original_name":"Tara Anaïse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55965355c3a36870cc00433a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Harrington","original_name":"Jennifer Harrington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wIMsdFjRljUe7lyIvlnzHhARpYd.jpg","credit_id":"5596534092514149f8000aa4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1099957,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Megan Peterson","original_name":"Megan Peterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5596536cc3a368146d002787","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Harrington","original_name":"Jennifer Harrington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wIMsdFjRljUe7lyIvlnzHhARpYd.jpg","credit_id":"5596532c9251414615000032","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2109141","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iutgRafq70CVnLPXK2sG8F1Dhzg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
