This dramatic selection of incidents and accidents spans most forms of circuit racing on both sides of the Atlantic during the 1980s. One of the most horrendous incidents shows a car at Nurburgring exploding into a monstrous fireball after hitting a wall. The driver suffered serious injuries, yet twelve months later he was on the circuits again. In another incident a car runs out of track and disintegrates while continuing its dreadful journey. Moments later out of it crawls the driver - unharmed!
