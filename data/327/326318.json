His fellow wrestlers help them shift house and celebrate their new home, but in the midst of their revelry sits Kazuo with a pained look on his face. He hates pro wrestling with a passion and is embarrassed by his father who has made a heel turn in order to save the ailing wrestling organization he belongs to. He even keeps his dad's profession a secret from his new classmates. When Ushinosuke finds out how his son feels, he sets up an unusual death match with a karate champion in a bid for acceptance. He is knocked down several times, but each time manages to rise to his feet and inch towards the championship. Finally he manages to unleash his finishing move, a devastating backdrop, and achieves a miraculous upset victory with Kazuo watching on proudly.","popularity":0.5468,"poster_path":"/eHp0UgX2bIpWgT1KOLTveeeXnFu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Backdrop del mio Papa production associates","origin_country":""},{"id":18535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snap","origin_country":""},{"id":47580,"logo_path":null,"name":"LEERIDERS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":16918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinequanon","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dad's Backdrop","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Otōsan no backdrop","type":"rōmaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Backdrop of My Papa","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Otō-san no backdrop","type":"rōmaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Backdrop del mio Papá","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Otōsan no bakkudoroppu","type":"rōmaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Otō-san no bakkudoroppu","type":"rōmaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Ukaji","original_name":"宇梶剛士","popularity":0.6361,"profile_path":"/lSiaVNyb5zpaJdva0iMHp6wWjRI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ushinosuke Shimoda","credit_id":"54e6b64bc3a3685af7000985","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryunosuke Kamiki","original_name":"神木隆之介","popularity":1.0654,"profile_path":"/ut7ewXjdgUmgkhJ1EtbOo9tbc7s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kazuo Shimoda","credit_id":"54e6b6d1c3a3682003000474","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaho Minami","original_name":"南果歩","popularity":0.5047,"profile_path":"/880kV8RgyqmCMUfsQ67XBSmSJQO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Hanae Kanehara","credit_id":"5933a34dc3a36859de018b0a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eiji Minakata","original_name":"Eiji Minakata","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":"/b06XDcWEiQ0uZiJjHzH977woqze.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Matsunosuke Shimoda","credit_id":"54e6b6f69251416f4b000a99","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuuki tanaka","original_name":"Yuuki tanaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tetsuo Kanehara","credit_id":"54e6b769c3a3682003000484","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553064,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramo Nakajima","original_name":"中島らも","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e6b813c3a3685aee000ad4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshio Lee","original_name":"李闘士男","popularity":0.2223,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e6b79ac3a3685aee000aca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429151,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yoshinobu Tei","original_name":"Yoshinobu Tei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e6b7cbc3a368200f000457","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3215834","wikidata_id":"Q11263219","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHp0UgX2bIpWgT1KOLTveeeXnFu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":206441,"name":"pro wrestling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"お父さんのバックドロップ（プレビュー）","key":"8XKlQuUq_N0","published_at":"2014-01-31T03:25:33.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bf1a5cf9251415cd106444c"}]}}}
