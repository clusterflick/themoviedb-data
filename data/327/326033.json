It tells the fictional story of how the country would be run if the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic party, were to win the election and its leader Nigel Farage become Prime Minister. The programme is filmed in the style of a fly-on-the-wall documentary that follows UKIP's first female Asian MP as she struggles with the party's stance on immigration amid mounting public discontent with its hardline policies. The role of Deepa Kaur, who is elected to serve as MP for the Romford constituency, is played by Priyanga Burford.","popularity":0.4274,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":23949,"logo_path":"/3QFwomSxcZZgMQGBkdUPuJEnSFB.png","name":"RAW","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UKIP: The First 100 Days","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priyanga Burford","original_name":"Priyanga Burford","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/uUWAc5bm2lYMxbmwnxIY4SriYfK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Deepa Kaur","credit_id":"55776594c3a36839530008f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Burton","original_name":"Hubert Burton","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Harry Long-Innes","credit_id":"5665b38cc3a36806a4000125","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1546022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Reed","original_name":"Tom Reed","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/gDvNQXHOQNBM5HyK9GfKu0tzPP1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Das Singh","credit_id":"5665b3d692514179e1000160","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Atkins","original_name":"Chris Atkins","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5665ad7492514179e1000098","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Atkins","original_name":"Chris Atkins","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5665b37292514179e500014b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4457370","wikidata_id":"Q18701757","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":15061,"name":"docudrama"},{"id":33858,"name":"right wing"},{"id":169086,"name":"political satire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"UKIP: The First Hundred Days - Channel 4 Promo","key":"BqeIU-1yKJE","published_at":"2015-02-12T11:34:45.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5665acc1c3a36806a200008f"}]}}}
