Security, much less peace, would seem to be unattainable; it is even difficult to find a common language in a country where everyone mistrusts each other. The directors of this film accompanied an ANA company during a year of frontline duty in Helmand. The soldiers are paid irregularly, there are not enough supplies and their equipment is substandard. They cannot fight a war with the equipment left behind by the ISAF.","popularity":0.1375,"poster_path":"/30OI0TjyaWOZA1G0Lwh35lzSuYB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71779,"logo_path":null,"name":"NHK Cosmomedia","origin_country":""},{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":69182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ponda","origin_country":""},{"id":69183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tourist With A Typewriter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Spring Not to Come This Year","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","original_name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/mGmeIikVSMsAUVcZGEFpODlwqS.jpg","credit_id":"54e75f23c3a368200f001075","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael McEvoy","original_name":"Michael McEvoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e75fb4c3a3685af90017f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","original_name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/mGmeIikVSMsAUVcZGEFpODlwqS.jpg","credit_id":"636ba14e8138310080839d8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","original_name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/mGmeIikVSMsAUVcZGEFpODlwqS.jpg","credit_id":"636ba155d7fbda00905c46c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4176750","wikidata_id":"Q50414121","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":868,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/30OI0TjyaWOZA1G0Lwh35lzSuYB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":579}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3541,"name":"afghanistan"},{"id":13065,"name":"soldier"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
