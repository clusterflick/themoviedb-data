With her physical limitations lifted, and the confirmation that her life matters, she blossoms into a confident young woman, using her newly found capabilities to bring hope back to her village. Gorgeously filmed in the Ethiopian countryside, Zemene is a poignant testament to the strength of the human spirit – and a powerful depiction of how much impact one person can have on another’s life. - Pia Chamberlain","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zemene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1919550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Beshir","original_name":"Jessica Beshir","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/p8lrUyDoNiteINEPwAqrsoGY5QC.jpg","credit_id":"616de846f92532009000ca56","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1833274,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Melissa R.
