The nation was founded upon the idea that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The nation would pay a bloody cost for denying that right to more than twelve percent of its population. But when slavery was first brought to America's shores, this war, and even the nation it tore apart, was centuries in the future. With incredibly detailed historical reenactments, expert commentary and the stories of slavery told through first-hand accounts, this is an epic struggle 400 years in the making. A journey into the past like none other. This is the story of these men and women who by their hands laid the foundation of what would become the most powerful nation on Earth.","popularity":0.209,"poster_path":"/hY1lXlRItNlktpgb7xlIvY1f6CS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":315,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up From Slavery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coby Batty","original_name":"Coby Batty","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/4E8Q6sa34ZeionRtjwiCwDMHTZX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"599404e5c3a3687f9e013d6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keydron Dunn","original_name":"Keydron Dunn","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Frederick Douglass","credit_id":"599404f4c3a3687f460128ff","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1583115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin R.
