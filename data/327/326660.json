After the factory goes bankrupt and closes, the filmmaker accompanies some of its employees as they continue to make their way, questioning them about their daily routines, the circumstances in which they live, about looking for work or the new jobs they find. One woman’s situation is precarious, but that doesn’t prevent her from bringing up her grandchildren. Another woman works here and there, flexible and resourceful. One man blossoms visibly in his newly unemployed state. Bit by bit, different aspects of their private lives and personal misfortunes emerge.","popularity":0.4893,"poster_path":"/nN4JlDSnqpaPZiVhg9MYJiSX8Ii.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115599,"logo_path":"/oy7KfmJ1cVX4JlmheLukhHvrkox.png","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":188,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over the Years","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"54e8fa08c3a3684ea6001d50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"563c8b959251414c700066ee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"563c8bb4c3a3681b5c0286d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","original_name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563c8bc1c3a3681b5c0286d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","original_name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563c8bd69251414c700066f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","original_name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563c8bebc3a3681b4d029f21","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584711,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markus Glaser","original_name":"Markus Glaser","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563c8c049251417819003a67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584712,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Kitzberger","original_name":"Michael Kitzberger","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ajrPuEw0tSTZmqnoVgceOnXnp5N.jpg","credit_id":"563c8c11c3a3681b4b0245b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"563c8c1b9251417819003a69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2112326,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Kutin","original_name":"Peter Kutin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be1214d0e0a263d7f0040c9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4769042","wikidata_id":"Q21104612","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aLXABah4Grtc7xa2CxGckJEhusj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z1Vp3s5vtPc1JqTmSPMQpPW6nsI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sz4AqQV6hHAQ3OdQIwX6BiavdIf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/nN4JlDSnqpaPZiVhg9MYJiSX8Ii.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/oJqCCqb5bMRM0H2OmVs2cr1khZZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1201,"name":"austria"},{"id":156052,"name":"unemployment"},{"id":163167,"name":"job hunting"},{"id":163997,"name":"job seeking"},{"id":247300,"name":"job switch"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
