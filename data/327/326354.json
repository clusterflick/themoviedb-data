The invention of the telephone and the phonograph at end of the nineteenth century marks a rupture in our experience of the human voice - a rupture which simultaneously fulfills a promise given by prophets and shamen since ancient times. Suddenly a voice can issue from out of nowhere, from the wrong mouth or from beyond the grave. Listening to our own voice, we experience ourselves as others.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lecture on Schizophonia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik B端nger","original_name":"Erik B端nger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e746bcc3a3685af900162d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik B端nger","original_name":"Erik B端nger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e746c4c3a3682003000f13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
