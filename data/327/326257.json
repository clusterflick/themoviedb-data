More than 40,000 fans flock to the campus each spring to experience the competition, the pageantry, and the storied tradition of the largest collegiate bicycle race in the USA – a grueling 200-lap, 50-mile, four-person relay race, modeled after the Indy 500. This documentary follows the journeys of four top teams, Cutters, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Gamma, and Teter, as they train for months – or even years – for their one shot at victory. One Day in April spectacularly captures the all-or-nothing spirit of sports where the difference between pride and glory or devastating heartbreak is decided in a moment. - Nina Zheng","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day in April","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4198806","wikidata_id":"Q24706753","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
