The two new studio cuts that round out the disc are OK at best, although they do display Summer's ability to adapt to changes in pop-dance sounds.","popularity":0.3955,"poster_path":"/t0SP1NJXdPBwG67bV9E4hKUt1AN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10692,"logo_path":"/qFS7NEIS3fiBW1wi6VMAcwAsFCX.png","name":"VH1","origin_country":"US"},{"id":647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony Music Entertainment Visual Works Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":7914,"logo_path":"/uVRzFVZP6bJIQOkOEegvbzPG2ID.png","name":"Epic Records","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Disco Diva","title":"Donna Summer - Live and More Encore!","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"VH1 Presenta Donna Summer en Vivo y Mas!!
