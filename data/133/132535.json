After an intense prison break, Kye's heroism gains him the attention of a ragtag group of rebels, led by an ex-military general. With the promise of guaranteed freedom, the general lures Kye into a dangerous hostage mission which leads him stranded alone on a planet for several years.  While alone, our hero has to decide whether he wants to continue on his violent path, or undo the damage he has done. But inner peace is hindered when Kye becomes infected with a symbiotic alien creature, which periodically causes hideous transformations.  It's Jekyll and Hyde meets Robinson Crusoe. The Incredible Hulk in the distant stars. A bullets-and-sand adventure that will introduce pulp science fiction to the cerebral, character-based intimacy of independent cinema.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2012-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arrowhead Signal","video":false,"vote_average":5.375,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205816,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan Elliott Stevens","original_name":"Ryan Elliott Stevens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kye","credit_id":"52fe4b97c3a368484e19057d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse O'Brien","original_name":"Jesse O'Brien","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b97c3a368484e190579","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse O'Brien","original_name":"Jesse O'Brien","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56aded18c3a3681c540090a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3021840","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
