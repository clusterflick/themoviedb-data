It too has a stream-of-consciousness narration: Jocasta, as she is about to kill herself, remembering what has happened to her. It too contains soul-delving solos, broken up by ensemble dances.

In this piece Graham pushed her habitual economy to its limits.","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":"/piFFaUvGMfGZ6UadsiZpNGQmYGA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Graham","original_name":"Martha Graham","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/lxur9MEvciM9KXegSAqWtlZqqub.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Queen Jocasta","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a368484e18fc3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Ross","original_name":"Bertram Ross","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"King Oedipus","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a368484e18fc3f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Taylor","original_name":"Paul Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tiresias","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a368484e18fc43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen McGehee","original_name":"Helen McGehee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Chorus Leader","credit_id":"57aab8c4925141425200049a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1131419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Hinkson","original_name":"Mary Hinkson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5oNZLBlocVJVnCztTnLRrHGRj6L.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Chorus","credit_id":"57aab8d5c3a3680711000e22","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akiko Kanda","original_name":"Akiko Kanda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"Chorus","credit_id":"678b16c9afcb32c49942f24f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Winter","original_name":"Ethel Winter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Chorus","credit_id":"57aab8cc9251416ec00021ae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Hodes","original_name":"Linda Hodes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Chorus","credit_id":"57aab8dc9251416ec00021bc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Payne","original_name":"Carol Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Chorus","credit_id":"57aab8eac3a3680821000eda","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bette Shaler","original_name":"Bette Shaler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Chorus","credit_id":"57aab8f29251412ddb000ef0","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Hammid","original_name":"Alexander Hammid","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/jv62yHBxHGKyys71GHT5YKzuxzE.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a368484e18fc2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1045478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Kroll","original_name":"Nathan Kroll","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a368484e18fc37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664042,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Clair D.
