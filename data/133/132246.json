As soon as she enters the place, Sonia gets very strange feelings and begins to hear terrifying noises. She also feels the presence of an increasingly disquieting person. She is so frightened she wants to leave on the spot; but David can't feel or see any of the things she describes. However, when Sonia gets kidnapped, her boyfriend begins to sense something is going on. He decides to investigate in order to get the young woman back. As he does so, he will meet disturbing characters, unexpected and undreamed-of help, and a truth from beyond.","popularity":0.1132,"poster_path":"/moBNwutxVf4GmVOt10ixV9uJtRM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ossessione","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1094776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Bataille","original_name":"Lucie Bataille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gD2cshNr5aV4qiQ1YRHfp1bhRlw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The White Ghost / The Strange Woman's Voice","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e865","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Beylard","original_name":"Guillaume Beylard","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Grégoire Schnitzler","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e869","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herve Beylard","original_name":"Herve Beylard","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sect Member 2","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e86d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Beylard","original_name":"Roger Beylard","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Sect Member 4","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e871","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy Chatelier","original_name":"Mandy Chatelier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Dreams Girl","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e875","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddy Cigale","original_name":"Eddy Cigale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Cop","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e879","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Eymery","original_name":"Roland Eymery","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"The Villager 1","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e87d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Françoise","original_name":"Marie Françoise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Sonia","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e881","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brice Gerbeau","original_name":"Brice Gerbeau","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Sect member 1","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e885","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikael Lynch","original_name":"Mikael Lynch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Dr. Abraham Sapirstein","credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e889","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Robin","original_name":"Christopher Robin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e85b","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Beylard","original_name":"Guillaume Beylard","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e849","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Beylard","original_name":"Guillaume Beylard","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e861","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":81228,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Robin Hood","original_name":"Christopher Robin Hood","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e855","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Remy Seffe","original_name":"Remy Seffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b8cc3a368484e18e84f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1300273","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/moBNwutxVf4GmVOt10ixV9uJtRM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11532,"name":"grindhouse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
