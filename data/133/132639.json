Instead of containing live footage, it provides a deeper look at the 'Gettysburg (1863)', the musical trilogy that appeared on 2004's 'The Glorious Burden', as well as the Civil War battle that inspired it.  The centerpiece of the 2-DVD set is the epic three-part song itself. In addition to the normal stereo version, it appears in two different expansive and powerful 5.1-channel surround-sound mixes (a 'Metal' mix and an 'Orchestral' mix). The music can be accompanied with moving images and lyrics that help document the course of the three-day battle.  Also included in the extensive package is an in-depth video tour of the Gettysburg battlefield, an interview with Jon Schaffer, two music videos from The Glorious Burden album, and other various extras.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/AtdrFWqaLzLLhLisO32vrCtbGkC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iced Earth: Gettysburg 1863","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Schaffer","original_name":"Jon Schaffer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/ddJWGXCDkDxGz4LGh7OuAstLWYE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"6128ecf0957ce500907ec457","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2576834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim 'Ripper' Owens","original_name":"Tim 'Ripper' Owens","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/rFSrWdj7QnCFVC2wcBB6O0WGx29.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"6128ed0d2c6b7b0089bb9af0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James MacDonough","original_name":"James MacDonough","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/74MJzRzV8BtM1xY7xenv2vZ2NlC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"6128ed27957ce500907ec4de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Christy","original_name":"Richard Christy","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/y9bHt6FUwUo9oWEKxQoy0DkgCJd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"6128ed4355c926008edf7704","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/btUABMPcjMRUhOBlabBZ342uK6K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtdrFWqaLzLLhLisO32vrCtbGkC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1270}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
