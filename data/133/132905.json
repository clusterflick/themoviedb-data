The film brings us the voices of those whose relatives were killed or disappeared or who were disabled during the conflict.  Suffering and pain reside in individuals and individual bodies, which we often forget under the collective ‘people’. The film excavates individual stories while accompanying a traveling exhibition of A People War that in 2007-2008 traversed the country for more than three months and was seen by more than 300,000 people. The film also reminds us that public acknowledgement of what happened is a precondition for healing.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frames of War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kesang Tseten","original_name":"Kesang Tseten","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba0c3a368484e191ebd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
