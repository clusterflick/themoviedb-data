The Reckoning follows dynamic ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo and his team for 3 years across 4 continents as he issues arrest warrants for Lord’s Resistance Army leaders in Uganda, puts Congolese warlords on trial, shakes up the Colombian justice system, and charges Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir with genocide in Darfur, challenging the UN Security Council to arrest him. Building cases against genocidal criminals presents huge challenges, and the Prosecutor has a mandate but no police force. At every turn, he must pressure the international community to muster political will for the cause.","popularity":0.1118,"poster_path":"/s3j4zfc8Dn2LNbVz0ofGzcsgSgU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reckoning: The Battle for the International Criminal Court","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":768038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pamela Yates","original_name":"Pamela Yates","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/xneGn4O94qIr92UayeWpdK9PZ0t.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ba0c3a368484e191f43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1212439","wikidata_id":"Q7759783","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s3j4zfc8Dn2LNbVz0ofGzcsgSgU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2009-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
