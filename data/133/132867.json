Born in Poland and forced to carry on following the untimely death of his family, Karol Wojtyla endured both personal hardships and the rape of his homeland by the Third Reich to spread the word of God through the Catholic Church. Later, as Pope John Paul II, Wojtyla was beloved by millions of Catholics worldwide. From the sexual-abuse scandal that shook the American Catholic Church in the later-20th century to the murder of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero and the near-fatal assassination attempt made on his own life, Pope John Paul II endured to bridge the gap between various faiths until his death resulting from Parkinson's disease in April of 2005.","popularity":1.2038,"poster_path":"/uD3yzYW4k0q4W9agQJtoNo50ago.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Five Mile River Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2064,"logo_path":"/4cxlmKotK2vAm0TKcGrSGyhxD07.png","name":"Lithuanian Film Studio","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2006-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Have No Fear: The Life of Pope John Paul II","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Jan Paweł II: Nie lękajcie się","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Jan Pawel II: Nie lekajcie sie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Jan Pawel II - Nie lekajcie sie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Have No Fear - The Life of Pope John Paul II","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Non abbiate paura.
