Constructed hundreds of years ago during the Inca Empire, this vast transportation network still weaves its way through modern-day Peru and Ecuador. More so than other remnants of the Inca civilization, Qhapaq Ñan is a symbol of a common identity that nourishes the dream of the Andean people to this day - to revive their cultural inheritance following centuries of European domination. As this visually striking documentary takes us along the Great Inca Road - revealing its contours, its history, and its secrets - we witness a different image of the Andes and its people.","popularity":0.1232,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey on Qhapaq Ñan - The Great Inca Road","title":"Voices of the Andes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Pachot","original_name":"Stéphane Pachot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b89c3a368484e18df79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stéphane Pachot","original_name":"Stéphane Pachot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b89c3a368484e18df7f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1667146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
