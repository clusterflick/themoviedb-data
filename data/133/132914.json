The Sari Soldiers follows Devi, a mother who's 15-year-old daughter is abducted by the army, and five other brave women, including Maoist Commander Kranti; Royal Nepal Army Officer Rajani; Krishna, a monarchist from a rural community who leads a rebellion against the Maoists; Mandira, a human rights lawyer; and Ram Kumari, a young student activist shaping the protests to reclaim democracy. The Sari Soldiers intimately delves into the extraordinary journey of these women on opposing sides of the conflict, through the democratic revolution that reshapes the country’s future.","popularity":0.0765,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":237649,"logo_path":null,"name":"Butter Lamp Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There are more than two sides to every story","title":"The Sari Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Bridgham","original_name":"Julie Bridgham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba0c3a368484e191f39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1245529","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
