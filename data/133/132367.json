A prototype for the best (but still, lesser) contemporary formalist music videos, like Peter Care’s “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?” and “Drive” (both for REM), Conner’s movie is an experiment in the visual language of film. But no matter how powerful a formal analysis of his filmmaking process may be in suggesting how Conner’s rhythms affect us, there is much in Breakaway – in Basilotta’s brash and unbridled self-assertiveness, in Conner’s feverish camera style, and even in the uncomplicated honesty of Cobb’s catchy lyrics and tune – that defies verbalisation… and must simply be loved! -- Senses of Cinema","popularity":0.108,"poster_path":"/7l4VgOAReB80Mma2ISvxsZcOHM7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakaway","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Basil","original_name":"Toni Basil","popularity":0.4074,"profile_path":"/gKXRSWexAbL9g10IkcLrw6NhTsu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a368484e18fb65","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Conner","original_name":"Bruce Conner","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/mw0E9AMe6vmSQfAfTQx53KgfIGU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a368484e18fb61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130519","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xctgqpPyIpZmm6moNFrsNSOK2b5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1508},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kyFMYqQ38GjhmEN2TumEhSakGVt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gILKTqc9Dwp9gXLy5cEJ74Asqdt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7l4VgOAReB80Mma2ISvxsZcOHM7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":837},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bi6lI8l5zW3iDBVVztrJpQCmjco.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Film-Makers' Cinematheque","release_date":"1967-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
