She barricades herself in a room and calls the police. Her call wakes the chief, who rallies the country justice constabulary and they set off toward the farm, in steam-car and on foot. Meanwhile, the maiden’s parents rush to save her. Everything points toward a showdown in the barn, where no one, including the police force, will be cowed.","popularity":1.2244,"poster_path":"/6tT7Vc21xI3josVHTLnYO6A7rQo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film
