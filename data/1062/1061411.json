The diverse age group joins in the classroom. Everyone is very excited, talking to each other, socialising, and laughing and found in a very cheerful atmosphere.  Then comes the teacher begins to ask questions about them, asking where they come from, what they do in life, and what reasons are for coming to Italy. Everyone answers the questions. When everyone talks about their experience, all the other laughing and joking, suddenly the phone of one of the students start ringing, and the teacher turns to him and asks the same questions. But, the cheerful atmosphere changes.","popularity":0.2596,"poster_path":"/m3FhMJFkxMMfQm5YplUB3Gb8HXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188581,"logo_path":null,"name":"Make A Wish Film
