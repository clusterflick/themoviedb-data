He strikes up a conversation with The Bartender, an older veteran of the bar, who is the only person remaining after last call. Venting to The Bartender about his current existential crisis they both end up drinking together, but when The Bartender goes to make sure everything is cleaned up for the night, he returns with a .38 Special Snubnose Revolver, also known as a \"Saturday Night Special\", and informs The Kid that someone must have left it behind. The two speculate where the gun could have come from, all the while they continue to drink, which makes things quite chaotic once the Kid decides to pick up the gun.","popularity":0.4678,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":979,"logo_path":"/9lmFTLAikX5hEhlJnY7t6oZXFmW.png","name":"Woods Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saturday Night Special","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Bogaert","original_name":"Stephen Bogaert","popularity":0.9449,"profile_path":"/iEnR0LaAnlJBwE9gDlB5r0v4XIt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67332fa91d72eb65f42e6b62","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Ambrose Calderone","original_name":"Gregory Ambrose Calderone","popularity":0.2752,"profile_path":"/qfwqiHyCuntMYcNLCjz0sk0Ih97.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67332fc279a32e4a6a501423","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1015986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Laferriere","original_name":"Kimberly Laferriere","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/s6X66lQMCNZM9slmkm2F0l4jF8g.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Veronica","credit_id":"67332fefbc78ce2b94ba5795","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1392140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Murphy","original_name":"Annie Murphy","popularity":0.8288,"profile_path":"/1cQ9Piq6kcTzmzJ9I4oGd7oFEdS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"67333019b750dbc5eab394ad","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1828340,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Devin Myler","original_name":"Devin Myler","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6398ec0bce9e9100d34e17c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connor Marsden","original_name":"Connor Marsden","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6398ecc5a8b2ca00d19cf495","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Ambrose Calderone","original_name":"Gregory Ambrose Calderone","popularity":0.2752,"profile_path":"/qfwqiHyCuntMYcNLCjz0sk0Ih97.jpg","credit_id":"67332f63bc78ce2b94ba5787","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connor Marsden","original_name":"Connor Marsden","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67332f7f50b1ec62a1b92ea8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3557546","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
