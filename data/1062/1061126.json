Western classical music has traditionally been seen as a procession of male geniuses, but the truth is that women have always composed. Hildegard of Bingen, Francesca Caccini, Clara Schumann, Florence Price and Elizabeth Maconchy - all these women battled to fulfill their ambitions and overcome the obstacles that society placed in their way. They then disappeared into obscurity, and only some have found recognition again.","popularity":0.0918,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":124316,"logo_path":"/gnyJWj8kgI3E2Ul07KVBVUqI45f.png","name":"Douglas Road Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":188309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Endemol West","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsung Heroines: Danielle de Niese on the Lost World of Female Composers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle de Niese","original_name":"Danielle de Niese","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/zQna8AK2jSpbAxcDaU9YsNl96Ga.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"63992fade263bb00a77d4562","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Evans","original_name":"Guy Evans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63992fd5a8b2ca008caac656","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8619350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
