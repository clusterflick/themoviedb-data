A musketeer in the company of the Cadets of Gascony who has mastered the art of poetry, he is in love with his cousin, the beautiful and gentle Roxane, an immaculate feline; but she has fallen in love with Christian, a cheeky Cavalier King Charles who has just joined the Cadets, much to Cyrano's displeasure. Roxane asks Cyrano to act as a messenger to talk to Christian. Torn but resigned, Cyrano agrees. Christian is handsome but lacks Cyrano's word, so Cyrano proposes a pact: he will be his fighting spirit, Christian will remain the charming body. Will the two of them manage to seduce Roxane?","popularity":0.2541,"poster_path":"/af1tFLPfqIYDET59z3hPQCshWsk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67043,"logo_path":"/lcpIJu30UucUTE5SCKYD1qFdDHr.png","name":"Nolita","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10159,"logo_path":null,"name":"nWave Pictures","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Cyrano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Gallienne","original_name":"Guillaume Gallienne","popularity":0.3462,"profile_path":"/nponKvpwED1CivIY3f2NlQGLWE9.jpg","credit_id":"639b75f404733f00845cee95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2791650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentin Adiba","original_name":"Valentin Adiba","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b7696ecc7e800a9c61f71","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2371550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gwenn Germain","original_name":"Gwenn Germain","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b768003726400d21f782d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2371551,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yann Germain","original_name":"Yann Germain","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b7687ecc7e80096e558e8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maxime Delauney","original_name":"Maxime Delauney","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/tts5wHeOyKRs6PzCFqCIUzuAEY.jpg","credit_id":"639b7733037264007e924ec4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Gallienne","original_name":"Guillaume Gallienne","popularity":0.3462,"profile_path":"/nponKvpwED1CivIY3f2NlQGLWE9.jpg","credit_id":"639b761df9a3fb00ca359e7a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Romain Rousseau","original_name":"Romain Rousseau","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":"/akhsckbffu7gpnOOa6zpcS2VRUv.jpg","credit_id":"639b794204733f00a2e7b45c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2572813,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthieu Zeller","original_name":"Matthieu Zeller","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b794b83901800bdb18e40","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586438,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edmond Rostand","original_name":"Edmond Rostand","popularity":0.2221,"profile_path":"/1O41HY2vZRmvvNky94MNL9o29cD.jpg","credit_id":"639b79818ddc34009399d38d","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066906,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mathieu Ageron","original_name":"Mathieu Ageron","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b793b04733f007d9c5d7f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1108,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/af1tFLPfqIYDET59z3hPQCshWsk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":739}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
