Having the ocean underneath and the forest behind, living their daily lives and taking care of each other, as siblings do. That changes one day, when children find a robot which somehow ended up in front of their door after a big night storm. The robot is out of battery, but once they figure out how to power it on, they find out that their destination is the same place: a utopian city called Ekk, where they think their lost mother is waiting for them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yYCruYKuEiQZrhvGHKqR0BVtRqc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188475,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARCHA Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Otis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Diviak","original_name":"Filip Diviak","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639bb0b981a7fc00d1c759a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2124976,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noemi Valentíny","original_name":"Noemi Valentíny","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639bb0c293db920084762b69","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Diviak","original_name":"Filip Diviak","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639bb0c79408ec0092872342","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832632,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Dobiáš","original_name":"Peter Dobiáš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639bb0d09408ec0083a2d53c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2832,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yYCruYKuEiQZrhvGHKqR0BVtRqc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
