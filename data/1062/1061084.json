Margie has been collecting salt and pepper shakers for 73 years -- at 94, her days are spent repeating the same, simple routine. When her granddaughter pays her a visit, the collection, now in the thousands, takes on a new life. With a score by Dan Deacon, the film -- part love letter, part documentary, part experiment -- merges the real, the fantastical, and the world of a computer desktop.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/e7rWNz5bM1bzIBvx9Vn4hxGxlMD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
