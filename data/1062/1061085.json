The game is an action game inspired by Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Bros. platform game, transposed to an augmented reality environment.The actors walk through the city, jumping, climbing, grasping yellow coins with their phones, obsessed by the gold fever. The Berlin city is the stage of this strange behaviour, while the gamers discover new ways of living the city landscape and its socio-economic texture. The game has been seen as an allegorization of the gold farming and microlabor mechanisms of Bitcoin mining.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 1 Up Fever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3830038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvia Dal Dosso","original_name":"Silvia Dal Dosso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63990c01c5840d007de59bb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3830039,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noccoli Presenti","original_name":"Noccoli Presenti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63990c35e263bb00a77d232a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
