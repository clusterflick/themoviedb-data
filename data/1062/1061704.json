That little girl is me, Alpha Two. And this is my story. Since my mother passed away, I've been living with my father. He's a journalist. I listen to him on the radio, and we often play football together. But one day, soldiers attack my father and his radio station, forcing him to flee. Before he left, he promises he will find me again. Now, I am alone, but I am Peuhl. My mother and I are people of the water. Like her, I am a flying fish. I help my father cross the skies, deserts, and seas, guiding him on his journey to Europe. And today, I can finally meet him again.","popularity":0.0738,"poster_path":"/s06fwVZDlJHzYNlA4fuAkP1GcBQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121045,"logo_path":"/hPpfekiqg9VyIA69BvIcbcoXhaf.png","name":"Les Contes Modernes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Dreamed Journey of Alpha Two","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Alpha Two's Dreamed Journey","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alpha Kaba","original_name":"Alpha Kaba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b51f1cb9f4b0093bdb8e7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832079,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elliot Raimbeau","original_name":"Elliot Raimbeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b522df9a3fb00890e3f51","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832078,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eliza Jäppinen","original_name":"Eliza Jäppinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b5224cb9f4b00842cb08e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832076,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Théo de Marcousin","original_name":"Théo de Marcousin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b51fef9a3fb00ca3595be","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Dudok de Wit","original_name":"Michael Dudok de Wit","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/oZp0cupuPs4bQffZFoGDtJtpDdB.jpg","credit_id":"639b521becc7e800cab301a7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2407309,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Suzanne Seidel","original_name":"Suzanne Seidel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760b9872c42dea0eabafe0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073988,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christophe Derbes","original_name":"Christophe Derbes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760b9d2db7194c6f31920e9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5123977,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adama Grévoz","original_name":"Adama Grévoz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760ba08611661e1046be79f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367386,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrice Nezan","original_name":"Patrice Nezan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760bb1694d207f7c96be813","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s06fwVZDlJHzYNlA4fuAkP1GcBQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5BAkOAULc8a9lfKdI08lK6EXh8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
