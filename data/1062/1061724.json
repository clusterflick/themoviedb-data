This is by no means a matter of choice: her country is at war. Unfortunately, nothing goes as planned. At the border, Amel loses the family who are accompanying her and finds herself alone. Along her way, she meets Bacem, an army deserter and oud (oriental lute) player. Together, the child and the former soldier navigate through the pain of exile and learn to rebuild themselves.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/jPHKdIFh8im75tiRutXkMP4iVm2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122128,"logo_path":"/iYPn1TwMpJXPRTF9O0m4h0nEmCS.png","name":"Special Touch Studios","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19437,"logo_path":"/1VqbDOThEcmDR6gn7et7cAs4lwr.png","name":"Paul Thiltges Distributions","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":88672,"logo_path":"/meFXC1APvM2kb6nxpOhHF1I9w9G.png","name":"Animoon","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Birds Don't Look Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karolina Sendecka","original_name":"Karolina Sendecka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542f95903c520138faa398","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771170,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nadia Nakhlé","original_name":"Nadia Nakhlé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b5e1ad100b600941d6529","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771170,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nadia Nakhlé","original_name":"Nadia Nakhlé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b5e20ecc7e800f68916ce","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sébastien Onomo","original_name":"Sébastien Onomo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b5e29f9a3fb0096920d9a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548778,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marion Boffelli","original_name":"Marion Boffelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b78bef9a3fb00ca359f1a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrien Chef","original_name":"Adrien Chef","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b78c98ddc340084393a3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791648,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grzegorz Wacławek","original_name":"Grzegorz Wacławek","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b78d28ddc3400d9ee3bd9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jPHKdIFh8im75tiRutXkMP4iVm2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
