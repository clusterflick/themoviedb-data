He comes with his own attractive aura of danger and drama, and the crowd are not disappointed. Animated in a sketchy style on paper, this film powerfully uses the graphic freedom of this technique to select and embellish, to swoop and wander around the village. Austere sound effects and an Albeniz guitar piece are used to heighten this charmingly modest drama in which ordinary things – a hammer driving a nail, a flock of birds wheeling in the sky – are given their due.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/vD8Ag1dEKdBiGokD6isiaLUJtKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1591,"logo_path":"/ijgtPNnX17XNLw7eLpX9BJT90Fq.png","name":"Rhino Films","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Caminante","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Traveller","type":"English Translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3245783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debra Smith","original_name":"Debra Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6399ce917cffda00bf0ddfd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3245783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debra Smith","original_name":"Debra Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6399ceac77c01f00a2144f79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785818,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeremy Moorshead","original_name":"Jeremy Moorshead","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6399cf06e263bb007a561bec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785818,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeremy Moorshead","original_name":"Jeremy Moorshead","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6399cf116e44bf00903e0432","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785818,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeremy Moorshead","original_name":"Jeremy Moorshead","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6399cf26e263bb0091071b10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405390,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew Dennis","original_name":"Matthew Dennis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6399cf53e263bb00c4f974f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3830638,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Bonell","original_name":"Carlos Bonell","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6399cf6cce9e910094b39146","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162899","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vD8Ag1dEKdBiGokD6isiaLUJtKw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"DVD","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
