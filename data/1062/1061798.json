One day, he realises he’s been infected with Heterosis, a strange virus decimating the community and turning gay men into… heterosexuals! Jim loses his throne and is abandoned by his entire entourage. All but one follower: Lucien, a scrawny young virgin. Together, they set off on a journey across the Marais (the parisian gay village), in search of the mysterious Doctor Ragoult, who claims to have found a cure for the virus. This cure could not only save Jim, but also prevent the extinction of homosexuality.","popularity":0.1044,"poster_path":"/8vbLHSKwAIAjc1kMW50ivd24oVP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107583,"logo_path":"/14asAv6f73J1V4smKEC6aiG8ihI.png","name":"Bobbypills","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Jim Queen and The Quest for Chloroqueer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Nguyen","original_name":"Marco Nguyen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b8f608390180082ae6a00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774224,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicolas Athané","original_name":"Nicolas Athané","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b8f6d04733f008c5cb16e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1224580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Balteaux","original_name":"Simon Balteaux","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b8f80f9a3fb00969218bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774226,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brice Chevillard","original_name":"Brice Chevillard","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b8f86839018007a6a6665","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596679,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Alric","original_name":"David Alric","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b8f8ed100b600941d7226","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9qOcKvRNu2jqebXLF1Tiqslu7ed.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.809,"height":256,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sklIBCIYrlLTonOVEttCIMTfHcG.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":975}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8vbLHSKwAIAjc1kMW50ivd24oVP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cEQCVRjP1VJ1oWGwVK6i91SA87A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
