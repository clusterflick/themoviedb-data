The company cited financial problems, but the real reasons were to be found elsewhere. Bolivia may be a small, poor nation on the global market, but a country's fierce local food culture can be sometimes a more powerful factor than economic clout. In his first feature-length documentary, Fernando Martinez shows what happened, a story driven by the characters behind the events and their life stories, such as renowned cooks and a review of popular sayings about the Bolivian food. The symbolism is obvious when a multinational giant is 'brought to its knees' by a country's traditions and heritage.","popularity":0.1436,"poster_path":"/dSkG7X36p21vtwbNaP7vy21YBxf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producen Bolivia","origin_country":""},{"id":188428,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Filmmaker Studio C.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":188429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Azpurua Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":8194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lagarto Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fast Food Off the Shelf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fast Food Off the Shelf","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Azpúrua","original_name":"Carlos Azpúrua","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/dBwMYxG7GysMx0n2P91hRThXPcT.jpg","credit_id":"639b46318a0e9b00c45a6f88","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583578,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Serapio Tola","original_name":"Serapio Tola","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b45eda4af8f00ba98c0d5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832043,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jesús Rojas","original_name":"Jesús Rojas","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b45b9988afd00e6367b2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832045,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Viviana Saavedra","original_name":"Viviana Saavedra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b460457d37800ca9bc19b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352748,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugo Castro Fau","original_name":"Hugo Castro Fau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b462257d37800bf1aa6b2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832042,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Pablo Jofré","original_name":"Juan Pablo Jofré","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b458c8a0e9b008af78d24","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525233,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Leandro Rocha","original_name":"Leandro Rocha","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b46148a0e9b00b6cef911","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832041,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gigio Díaz","original_name":"Gigio Díaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b45c957d37800bf1aa68f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Martínez","original_name":"Fernando Martínez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b44a58a0e9b00b6cef89e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2567019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gustavo Soto","original_name":"Gustavo Soto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b455ca4af8f00ba98c0a2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832041,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gigio Díaz","original_name":"Gigio Díaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b457e57d37800bf1aa673","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3832039,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fernando Martínez","original_name":"Fernando Martínez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b4530988afd007daf8826","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1582,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dSkG7X36p21vtwbNaP7vy21YBxf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
