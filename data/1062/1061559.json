Exposed on 70+ year old black and white film. When you know you’ve completely sunken into a decomposition of yourself…. What’s next? An unformed, un-met, mis-understood version of yourself, goo, dumb, cracking and falling from your feet? No. Repetition reaps and cyclicity spells life. Recomposing Decomposition is the protagonist to the compost heap.
