The large piece is hard to ignore, even more so with the creepy looking Jesus hanging from it. The movement of life around it pushes it to some most unlikely places, catching those that happen upon it a little off guard, forcing them to do some 'on the spot' inner reflection on their lives and actions. While most dismiss the object as an annoyance, one person is profoundly changed by the encounter. Was it divine intervention or just pure chance?","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creepy Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1652738,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Scheuerman","original_name":"Chris Scheuerman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63995188ce9e9100d34e535c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Cermak","original_name":"Jason Cermak","popularity":0.3909,"profile_path":"/Am3whjOE2lmqK1cNT8uY3slgIG2.jpg","credit_id":"6399519ec5840d007de5ce2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1454081","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
