They are good friends and they both share the same dream of becoming filmmakers. Tomás, being a 24 year-old loser, starts worrying about his uncertain future since he doesn’t have a job, he never went to college and he smokes a lot of weed, therefore becoming unreliable for everyone. Tomás sets up to make the first film from his hometown: Campeche, México. With this mission, he hopes to attain success, money and love, but in the process, he might endanger his friendship with Paco, his only true friend.","popularity":0.1999,"poster_path":"/aUvvPLkTkNch4FG6ntZMesloTyu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ola
