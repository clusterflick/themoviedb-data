They form the acquaintance of two trappers, Bob Cole and Jim Watson, who hunt in the neighborhood. As fate will have it, both trappers love the same girl, the elder sister, but she loves Bob, while the younger girl is attracted by Jim. The elder girl, however, through a woman's whim, pays marked attention to Jim simply to arouse jealousy in Bob. He, in temper, cannot reason her motive and leaves, so through pique she accepts and marries Jim. Later Bob revisits the place, feeling that the girl loves him best, and tries to induce her to go away with him. He finally succeeds and, as you may imagine, fate brings about justice.","popularity":0.5536,"poster_path":"/rAgNo8XmdCQyNHPQX8fZQflk41b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Aisles of the Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Younger Daughter","credit_id":"5e3857750c2710001873644e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Elder Daughter","credit_id":"62099e82dd83fa001b45923d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William J.
