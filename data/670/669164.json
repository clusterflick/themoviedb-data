Mia, 11 and too wise for her age, asks Hugo, 15 and blasé, to tell her about Chaïnes – a girl he spent evenings with at the lake, trying to seduce her. He felt the fear of declaring his love and the torment provoked by the exuberant but secretive Chaïnes, who never shows her emotions. Mia and her siblings surround them, like a choir. A slow, dark, documentary in which time doesn't seem to exist.","popularity":0.0549,"poster_path":"/4TQITaNR9mgoLcRMwa2eGfcJr0T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108590,"logo_path":null,"name":"5à 7 Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tender","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chaïnes Bizot","original_name":"Chaïnes Bizot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6101dc027d5f4b007431033c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Mercier","original_name":"Hugo Mercier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6101ddc1a217c00046c0f2f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Desmoulin","original_name":"Mia Desmoulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6101ddd94284ea0074cfd0ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Desmoulin","original_name":"Tony Desmoulin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6101e11cf6787a005e305e5a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Desmoulin","original_name":"Teddy Desmoulin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6101e14522931a002975fb59","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Léa Desmoulin","original_name":"Léa Desmoulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6101e15c6ee3d70076323a5f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kylian Desmoulin","original_name":"Kylian Desmoulin","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6101e16c7d5f4b007431104d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097254,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathias Bouffier","original_name":"Mathias Bouffier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbf7f95b1240002c176e8e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1982422,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Bertier","original_name":"Martin Bertier","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbf803ea84c700412c93de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Pagliai","original_name":"Isabel Pagliai","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbf7ef46aed4006e201bd1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097254,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathias Bouffier","original_name":"Mathias Bouffier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbf7e646aed40040314f83","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Pagliai","original_name":"Isabel Pagliai","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbf7dc4a4bf60041a560aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1982423,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helen Olive","original_name":"Helen Olive","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbf80c5b1240007a6ff1df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Pagliai","original_name":"Isabel Pagliai","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e36d3e098f1f1000f05c441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11657888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYffbdeqVbvc2zxbXCqOI31Ucue.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4TQITaNR9mgoLcRMwa2eGfcJr0T.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4qHDzabhcI6wRh8kpEZ06l8CT7y.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":704,"name":"adolescence"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FID -
