His only remaining solace is Tuesday night practice, but with an average age of 74 and suffering a haemorrhaging of the bass section his beloved choir is facing a crisis of its own. So the hunt begins to find ‘brown-haired men’ in their 40s and 50s who can take the choir forward.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/rEn2qFT4Gcw5spDuPTKBxaWnYME.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men Who Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Williams","original_name":"Dylan Williams","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e373d2b37b3a90015afdec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14413278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1jAZQekYbnbPDDWXpE3eYcPQ6lH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rEn2qFT4Gcw5spDuPTKBxaWnYME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tempo Documentary Festival","release_date":"2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MEN WHO SING (Trailer)","key":"4KADpW3ikaM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-05-25T14:37:14.000Z","id":"6179bb72fdc4fa002aa136e2"}]}}}
