The town roisters made fun of her and his love. That made trouble and the chief vigilante believed him the cause of it all. So he was \"in wrong\" all around. The girl's father also sided with the opinion of the world, and sent both the boy and girl away. Mother was on a visit at the time, and therein the need of such a one at home was proved, for once back she sent the father out to bring them home again. The boy in the gold hills had been misunderstood again. Marauding merchants had left their victim on the mountain pass and the boy, coming on the scene, was again accused, but the lie in the end destroyed itself.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Misunderstood Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Daughter","credit_id":"5e385acb37b3a90017b12e32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Barrymore","original_name":"Lionel Barrymore","popularity":0.8391,"profile_path":"/ru11rLUzzLwKjR0ykTLkNIN9jcJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Father","credit_id":"6244dc78223a8b005fafdaed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Bruce","original_name":"Kate Bruce","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/oLC99DsB0gkPdsZJRi0d1D1B4hD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"6244dc868ee49c004935ea35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Son","credit_id":"6244dc9a223a8b005fafdb28","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Paget","original_name":"Alfred Paget","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/rGXy9gRwMRb6GhU8bQeReH56hsJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Vigilante Leader","credit_id":"6244dca90f3655004a1845b7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"A Thieving Merchant","credit_id":"6244dcb85a99150090cf5e6a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Barry","original_name":"Viola Barry","popularity":0.2458,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Spanish Girl","credit_id":"6244dccabe55b7009312c9e3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","credit_id":"6209d11f931ea100940a6d3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
