The story is of a girl who tries to be an author and has the usual fate of such. The new interest comes when she enters the home of the publisher because the policemen won't let her sit on the park benches and she wants to hide out of sight of them. She is starving and there is fruit on the table which she eats, but when the \"burglar\" comes she feels in duty bound to protect the place from him; it is the publisher, and from this meeting the two young people fall in, it always happens in fiction, why say it? But even with this ending the offering has much to commend it. Able direction and good acting give it atmosphere and it will go all right.","popularity":0.3782,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Folly of Anne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"5e38683a98f1f10014072f6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elmer Clifton","original_name":"Elmer Clifton","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":"/mvXMvJTfeZkj3rqU0ANVW5xUN92.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Sympathtic Publisher","credit_id":"620a6ea25c324700dc7d2b71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Conway","original_name":"Jack Conway","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/eMA6PQ0OEnAZM9wZjkflrAO3rkL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Heartless Publisher","credit_id":"620a6eb0fab3fa0132ebbf19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.E.
