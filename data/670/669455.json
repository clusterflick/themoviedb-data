Only a kokle player is brave enough –  and musical enough – to venture there and save her.  With its mummers, imps, three-headed demon king and singing mole cricket, I Played, I Danced is a story like none other. Composed in 1977, Imants Kalniņš’s elaborate musical language is blended with Latvian folk to create a unique and moving soundworld. Leading young Latvian director Laura Groza-Ķibere and visual artist Miķelis Fišers bring out the wild energy of this opera in their new production that forces us to ask: How much should we fight the demons of the past while striving for a better future?","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":"/vVUxmUj8g9y1J1ZorCbD74AOa85.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2020-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Played, I Danced -
