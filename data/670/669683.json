Far from the world of bland, impersonal chains, Wildwood welcomes you to 50's and 60's motels with names like the Astronaut, the Eden Roc and the Bonanza - or whatever was new and exotic at the time. It's also home to the country's biggest boardwalk and a rich musical history. ..","popularity":0.4342,"poster_path":"/yZcJhmVTKNgdm1EwFsgvewaIbyj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wildwood Days","title":"Wildwood Days","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Blavat","original_name":"Jerry Blavat","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e39000043250f0017c4783c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chubby Checker","original_name":"Chubby Checker","popularity":0.2221,"profile_path":"/duvzX47Bj25h1YQCP1OE8tfOHYP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e39001498f1f1000f085b75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Clark","original_name":"Dick Clark","popularity":0.4947,"profile_path":"/5b0BckJqRZIwi1LcbuA8o2KPZTZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e39002343250f0017c47884","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Rydell","original_name":"Bobby Rydell","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":"/dcRsj2TwgTSNNu87EssPdfYS9lZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e39003343250f0017c478cf","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0467426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yZcJhmVTKNgdm1EwFsgvewaIbyj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
