Magoon, a big, jovial miner, loves her most of all, however, and asks her to become his wife. Nettie is in love with Colter, a young Easterner, and though it pains her to do so, tells Magoon of the fact. Magoon leaves town to become sheriff of the adjoining county. A murder is committed in the mining camp, and Colter is unjustly accused. Nettie rescues him from jail and sends him to Magoon. The sheriff with admirable self-sacrifice hides his rival, and, when the posse arrives, points out what Nettie has done for the boys of the mining camp. Colter is released, and all the boys escort him back to Nettie.","popularity":0.5817,"poster_path":"/t9dluGpjGzPYXiOSY5y2MAJGzBL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angel of Contention","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nettie - the Angel","credit_id":"5e3865ab37b3a90019b14683","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spottiswoode Aitken","original_name":"Spottiswoode Aitken","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/oxtS8L2eigbXalqO9XDTPlz8YQA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nettie's Father","credit_id":"620a6adacb80280108cd33a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Siegmann","original_name":"George Siegmann","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/ekmTjMAXd71x4KSrFVfkc90vzDP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sheriff Magoon","credit_id":"620a6ae9cae17c00909be09d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raoul Walsh","original_name":"Raoul Walsh","popularity":0.334,"profile_path":"/qwQVJ66JvChRPIFtLtSy8DkCnKW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jack Colter","credit_id":"620a6af8e33f8300f21973ad","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258718,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Pattullo","original_name":"George Pattullo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620a6ac7014325008d244693","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150493,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Will Levington Comfort","original_name":"Will Levington Comfort","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620a6abcef8b3200439c4ef1","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1148395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John B.
