Released in 1960, it’s one of 13 titles in Au Pays de Neufve-France, a series of poetic documentary shorts about life along the St. Lawrence River. Off-camera narration, written by Pierre Perrault, frames the Innu participants through an ethnographic lens. Co-directed by René Bonnière and Perrault, a founding figure of Quebec’s direct cinema movement.","popularity":0.4708,"poster_path":"/rsMSyJ9lGj15MyC9QLnsESG64ds.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1963-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Attiuk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Bochner","original_name":"Lloyd Bochner","popularity":0.7947,"profile_path":"/khch0Jh2N4XcyrmvczD6Eo61vAm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63d2f71a031a1d0083a08021","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1644639,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel Thomas-d'Hoste","original_name":"Michel Thomas-d'Hoste","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655ccf4d7f054018d7918427","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704488,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tony Betts","original_name":"Tony Betts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f6f9031a1d0079d590f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Larry Crosley","original_name":"Larry Crosley","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f710031a1d0079d590ff","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2599324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Knight","original_name":"John Knight","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f708e72fe800e9e698e2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Perrault","original_name":"Pierre Perrault","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/c8Vwck8Mvpgl3hLvHbnmwjjbjGo.jpg","credit_id":"63d2f6b5cb71b800896cd54e","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242551,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Campbell","original_name":"Ken Campbell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f6e25a07f5007b0b593c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Perrault","original_name":"Pierre Perrault","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/c8Vwck8Mvpgl3hLvHbnmwjjbjGo.jpg","credit_id":"63d2f6ac031a1d008922492b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Bonnière","original_name":"René Bonnière","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":"/rKKIb8ajKMuJAXW6CaxkVmbXjfv.jpg","credit_id":"63d2f681e72fe800b205341d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2490940,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Howells","original_name":"David Howells","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f6fe031a1d007f010762","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Perrault","original_name":"Pierre Perrault","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/c8Vwck8Mvpgl3hLvHbnmwjjbjGo.jpg","credit_id":"5e387ef40c2710001a73ba3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225118","wikidata_id":"Q123287417","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rsMSyJ9lGj15MyC9QLnsESG64ds.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195405,"name":"indigenous community"},{"id":215162,"name":"indigenous peoples"},{"id":227593,"name":"ethnographic film"},{"id":236395,"name":"innu"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
