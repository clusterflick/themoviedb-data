The husband of a patient has just died, calls on the doctor, intending to kill him. The grief-crazed man is foiled several times by the return of the tramp, whom the maid at last pushes out of the house. She hears the doctor struggling with his assailant and faints. The tramp hears the doctor's cry for help and enters by a rear window, despite the objections of a policeman, in time to save his benefactor.","popularity":0.5964,"poster_path":"/3qYUTmkeg73GQ86ywhOmdPX9uLy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cry for Help","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Barrymore","original_name":"Lionel Barrymore","popularity":0.8391,"profile_path":"/ru11rLUzzLwKjR0ykTLkNIN9jcJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Tramp","credit_id":"6209cd25fab3fa0132eb4a45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Maid","credit_id":"6209cd32c92c5d001b348564","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Miller","original_name":"Walter Miller","popularity":0.264,"profile_path":"/sg0Ruah5XQ4UhBAIMeEISqSwlQJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"6209cd3f38e51000cd4cc45c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Carey","original_name":"Harry Carey","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/AvNDsYjkLgeFHbxGFIFyl6QRgeM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Thief","credit_id":"6209cd47839d93001c2d9ae6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Thief's Wife - the Charity Patient","credit_id":"6209cd5db076e500b62a2c0c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Witness to Accident","credit_id":"6209cd6b858678001b1d8c1e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Witness to Accident","credit_id":"6209cd78cae17c1f7d0f3c47","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Witness to Accident","credit_id":"6209cd861cac8c0067783bdf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John T.
