In three chapters, they explore the healing powers of radon gas found in Austria, the powerful energy felt in stones in Switzerland, and the pearls created by sweat and blood found in Polish caves, a memento of those who died there. Together, these chapters form a geological and cultural history of our (often bodily) relation to the subsoil of the Earth, enabling different modes of knowing and experiencing the world. Like Castorp, the viewer is hence placed in a different reality, and invited to take \"the ride into the mountains to be healed\".","popularity":0.0764,"poster_path":"/shvBRF1YfpAydX4Y240aeHMx5dJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Messidor Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2020-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eitan Efrat","original_name":"Eitan Efrat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e36d5b1ac8e6b0011c58209","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Mann","original_name":"Daniel Mann","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e36d5d9ac8e6b0018c5298f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eitan Efrat","original_name":"Eitan Efrat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5dde7c688cd0003af6648d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eitan Efrat","original_name":"Eitan Efrat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5dde8bfd7aa4003be812b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Mann","original_name":"Daniel Mann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5ddea2ec0c580035b29e95","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776017,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daniel Mann","original_name":"Daniel Mann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5ddeaed8cc4a003af256ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Mann","original_name":"Daniel Mann","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5ddeb87d41aa0036eb7010","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirah Foighel Brutmann","original_name":"Sirah Foighel Brutmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5dde5f955c65003898f640","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2391097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laszlo Umbreit","original_name":"Laszlo Umbreit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5dde6eec0c580037a7d3a8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eitan Efrat","original_name":"Eitan Efrat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5dde846af8f800354ae27d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGr2gvmomkZTogngnwghuxUSQXl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i1CJpzLZ3gwwITFEaaJCEwF3Yuk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6pCgOU87hfWddDJCngEB6kcusqO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/shvBRF1YfpAydX4Y240aeHMx5dJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2020-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
