Nevertheless human intervention is visible in almost every breathtaking vista Alexis Destoop recorded.  Cold, calm footage of snowfields, bodies of water, industry and research stations pass by, while a narrator from the near future reports on an investigation whose object remains concealed. In the meantime he reflects on the border as a political construct, the intangible, mythical power of nature and the expansion of fossil-fuel extraction to areas that were virtually impenetrable before global warming.  Humming, growling machines provide constant background buzz in this subjective exploration of a landscape where past and future meld. Northern Drift is an aesthetic, philosophical investigation of mankind and its environment – a relationship akin to shadow-boxing.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":"/imE2Hul52MQNVcGWqpSgZSYcUjA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139540,"logo_path":null,"name":"An Archer A
