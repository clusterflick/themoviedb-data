Before that, they want to make their dream of a trip to Europe come true. They book private accommodations through an Internet portal and embark on their 4-weeks-journey. On their arrival in Germany Elisabeth picks them up at the airport. She is the daughter of the landlady of Mark and Olivias first accommodation, a tiny house, located at a beautiful lake, in the hometown of Olivia's great-grandparents. They learn that the 82-years old landlady is in the hospital and dying. Elisabeth drives Mark and Olivia to the house. And then the two young people spend their first night in Germany. A night in which Mark gets to know the owner in a special way. The next morning, it is strangely quiet over the house by the lake. And no one will know so quickly what happened a few hours ago.","popularity":0.2733,"poster_path":"/mHHlmK7XqAYBbtuEHEEUPkjuO3V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128595,"logo_path":null,"name":"XAMARAM Entertainment SE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frieda - Coming Home","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2426801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Kanettis","original_name":"Elisabeth Kanettis","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/fFLATpZzsv8KUqmXjWcWjrNqsFB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"5e36cc024ca676001251e091","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timo Willman","original_name":"Timo Willman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mark","credit_id":"5e36cc0d43250f0015c27741","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2223998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maike J체ttendonk","original_name":"Maike J체ttendonk","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/9hcd8xOKrvnwlFMzoHf1bWVSAcA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Young Gerda","credit_id":"5e36cc1cac8e6b0011c57451","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffen Gr채bner","original_name":"Steffen Gr채bner","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Walter","credit_id":"5e36cc2898f1f1000f05ad2f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Niesche","original_name":"Madeleine Niesche","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Elisabeth","credit_id":"5e36cc3643250f0013c24114","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Errol Trotman-Harewood","original_name":"Errol Trotman-Harewood","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/os3qZAfBcyR076BjX8lTMgBISFs.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"TV-Host","credit_id":"5ef40db581a7fc0037bcb489","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael W.
