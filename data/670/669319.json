In keeping with earlier releases in this series, Steven Wilson’s approach to this album for new stereo & 5.1 mixes is to faithfully retain the spirit & sounds of the original album mix, while applying modern mix techniques to bring further clarity to the individual instrument, vocal & overdubs for each track. The songs, instantly familiar to a multitude of Yes fans, remain so, with the new mixes – especially in 5.1 form – providing a greater sense of space for each voice to be heard, Anderson’s voice seems to join the listener in the room, Howe & Wakeman’s solos glisten with clarity & Bruford/Squire remind all that they were unmatched as a rhythm section during that period.","popularity":0.2325,"poster_path":"/ytdcFhdG0YmBaCtWgQzALrvEMdg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yes: Close to the Edge","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Anderson","original_name":"Jon Anderson","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/46rlm4jW8VSzZBHqtE51psFJOFp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"6436c5a7aede5900b6c19397","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Bruford","original_name":"Bill Bruford","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/m0HltnTL3lycrrMKXijpxhd42Ar.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Drums, Percussion","credit_id":"6436c6b01f748b00b6a3cb90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Howe","original_name":"Steve Howe","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":"/1xAzgzEGdN9p2cTGKQmUPSVjB8A.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Electric and Acoustic Guitars, Vocals","credit_id":"6436c5d41f748b0077153a91","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Squire","original_name":"Chris Squire","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/jaDV1KG0h8DmkoLl59H8S51QzV0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bass Guitars, Vocals","credit_id":"6436c5c41f748b0077153a86","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Wakeman","original_name":"Rick Wakeman","popularity":0.207,"profile_path":"/mv3YhykDvvbDZLnREKfmSJ4EpHJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Organ, Grand Piano, Mellotron, Synthesizer","credit_id":"6436c669aede5901133220b5","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pyRZo9ukx4meQzqubLjb5HQDVxd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytdcFhdG0YmBaCtWgQzALrvEMdg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1151}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
