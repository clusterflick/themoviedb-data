Carried away by his passion for women and gambling, he goes so far as to commit perjury. A classic revisited by Mesguich with a lot of visual effects: special effects, magic tricks, imposing sets. A playful staging for this tragi-comic play.","popularity":0.3678,"poster_path":"/zsszVsIae3FpZhgRAQccju89XyA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coopérative de
