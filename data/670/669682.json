The work presented is made with images shot in the city of Yujiapu, near Tianjin where ancestral fishing villages have been destroyed to make way for a multibillion-dollar real estate project that was to become the new financial district of the area. The entire city was developed but never finished and has been left uninhabited for over six years. The film uses the lines and frames of the buildings of Yujiapu and the lines and the frames of the film strip to create abstract elements that slowly reveal an incredible desolate urban landscape.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/eQ1I5BgAmnqlcC3BNpOv0heHw2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yujiapu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Lemieux","original_name":"Karl Lemieux","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/jOeSFKyTcESAi8QMgVLItkRoZf5.jpg","credit_id":"5e38f4024ca676001a555001","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2529090,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"BJ Nilsen","original_name":"BJ Nilsen","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e38f4374ca6760017557279","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eQ1I5BgAmnqlcC3BNpOv0heHw2F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sonic Acts Festival","release_date":"2017-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
