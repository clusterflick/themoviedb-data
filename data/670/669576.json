The timeless sources that director Ma Lanhua mines also comprise French comedy, Chinese opera and contemporary (performance) art. Ma also utilises cinema's history, particularly the early, silent era with title cards, colours reminiscent of hand-coloured films and special effects from the arsenal of film pioneer Georges Meliès.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7am6FThGvVr02ni9ensCyISg7Uu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2019-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Honor Among Thieves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Song Si Gong Da Nao Jin Hun Zhang","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ma Lanhua","original_name":"Ma Lanhua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3871bf37b3a90015b1555a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ma Lanhua","original_name":"Ma Lanhua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e38718343250f0015c48f9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ma Lanhua","original_name":"Ma Lanhua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f45261338357c70a6a196a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ma Yixiang","original_name":"Ma Yixiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f45266338357c70a6a196f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10488542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vzWpivhr0ZURMYXK1Gj5Sk1qlYB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7am6FThGvVr02ni9ensCyISg7Uu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIRST International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
