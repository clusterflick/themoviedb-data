The reel deals with three or four different cases that come up, one a female bootlegger, the other a diminutive man charged with beating his big wife; another raises the question of whether a mule is gentle, and Bobby is called on to ride him. The last charge is against a wild man who escapes, taking Bobby along as he is chained to him. A train runs over the chain and the two drop from the trestle into the police auto.","popularity":0.1142,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Case Dismissed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Arthur","original_name":"Jean Arthur","popularity":0.3249,"profile_path":"/h46KhIQOOMPUMIdGNSN3A4zwcGQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"5e3ae87691745b00142e0ea0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Summerville","original_name":"Slim Summerville","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":"/940E4Wlj0XNUgwa1JtR2zRnZuNz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Slim","credit_id":"60048a25cf62cd003c661bb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Dunn","original_name":"Bobby Dunn","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/awR4tammCTGhw6oVWnFGGKuAb0V.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bobby","credit_id":"60048a2e420228003df22ab2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Summerville","original_name":"Slim Summerville","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":"/940E4Wlj0XNUgwa1JtR2zRnZuNz.jpg","credit_id":"5e3ae88891745b00172e2705","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0218873","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1924-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
