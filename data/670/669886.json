It is a name that represents the highest degree of perfection, a quest for beauty that surpasses that of any other piano virtuoso. However Michelangeli also had a reputation for cancelling concerts at short notice and was consequently portrayed in the media as a somewhat neurotic artist. This documentary is the result of a 30-year search that has resulted in unusual interviews with those who knew him, and has also uncovered a wealth of new archive material: We get to experience Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli as he has never been seen before – and more importantly, as he has never been heard before. We also witness the maestro’s struggle back to his former perfection after suffering a devastating heart attack.","popularity":0.3212,"poster_path":"/aGIr7AqnniZSh6Bdz8XKAGGUA1B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128729,"logo_path":"/nsFlJw9R4yq5YRFr0cIQ6uxPlUS.png","name":"3B-Produktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Perfection: The Pianist Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, un pianiste d’exception","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Beyond Perfection","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2718311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cord Garben","original_name":"Cord Garben","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f15f24a3852020036d87413","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","original_name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/wgESY3384x00YZgyopCEt05695T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f15f25b6262080036630ac4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2449060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli","original_name":"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/YHbn8yKwOWvKtyRordiAOoTQd7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive)","credit_id":"6485b552c9dbf90100cbedd1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dag Freyer","original_name":"Dag Freyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3a554898f1f1000f099dd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Syrthos J.
