The story takes place in the late 20th Century and relates to history of territory recently known as the Eastern Block. Jan Hus introduces three individuals - Ryszard Siwiec, Oskar Brüsewitz, and Graham Bamford, who set themselves on fire to protest against the political regimes in which they lived, and against which they had struggled.","popularity":0.0812,"poster_path":"/7KJX1FF1LeHoyuOlD5oQ2a9IitS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2009-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jan Hus - mse za tri mrtvé muze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2059747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natália Drabiščáková","original_name":"Natália Drabiščáková","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/8igmwvrkcMAvIo01o7yKjyHUfHy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Maria Siwiecová","credit_id":"5e37d9df43250f0015c3ed62","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1439897,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michal Gábor","original_name":"Michal Gábor","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e37d9910c2710001872e836","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radim Špaček","original_name":"Radim Špaček","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/d1hWIqU6lOMgN1MkwHRgNK0UTQk.jpg","credit_id":"5e37d9b343250f0015c3ed3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311061,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jakub Halousek","original_name":"Jakub Halousek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e37d92037b3a90013b0b2df","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2528414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miroslav Bambušek","original_name":"Miroslav Bambušek","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e37d8bf37b3a90013b0b26d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2398854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kateřina Krutská-Vrbová","original_name":"Kateřina Krutská-Vrbová","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e37d96143250f0019c44993","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2528414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miroslav Bambušek","original_name":"Miroslav Bambušek","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e37d8d04ca67600145339d4","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Petr Kofroň","original_name":"Petr Kofroň","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e37d9390c2710001572f5da","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2022146,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Václav Flegl","original_name":"Václav Flegl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e37d98143250f0015c3ecc9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3615234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KJX1FF1LeHoyuOlD5oQ2a9IitS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jan Hus - mše za tři mrtvé muže (2009) - ukázka","key":"gxglQmhMbIg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-08-31T11:26:24.000Z","id":"5e37da934ca676001a53ef61"}]}}}
