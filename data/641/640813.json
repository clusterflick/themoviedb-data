Nati and Seba do the deliveries for their mother’s canteen and spend time with a group of friends who make a living committing minor crimes. When Nati discovers that her parents have a debt they cannot pay, she tries to join the gang to get the money. During the robbery to a restaurant, Nati disobeys the gang leader and puts the plan in danger. With the collaboration of his men, the chief rapes Nati as punishment for her ‘rebellious’ attitude. Seba manages to find her, but Nati is furious and –in revenge– she decides to kill them one by one.","popularity":0.2645,"poster_path":"/acxGPOsAyeUVZgVokS2KUzW9CKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amer Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":29266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pensa & Rocca Producciones","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2019-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Like Me?","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Krasinsky","original_name":"Martina Krasinsky","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/qZSlxWrOBJYIdW6YEYcBp0OKupS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nati","credit_id":"5dabf045b2681f001495426b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leticia Brédice","original_name":"Leticia Brédice","popularity":0.2435,"profile_path":"/ezcOFgHagk5RINJYvKhSBDAjLl6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5dabf052b2681f0014954285","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Aráoz","original_name":"Daniel Aráoz","popularity":0.2124,"profile_path":"/tx46xI0fjGPM6gtkYSOclwHUQqa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yuca","credit_id":"5dabf05ded28b90017da4019","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Antonio Caponi","original_name":"Marco Antonio Caponi","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/iPWVfj5jnfDRmV78ovN7iHtHIu4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nacho","credit_id":"5dabf06aed28b90012d9f771","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Loisi","original_name":"Daniel Loisi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Joaco","credit_id":"5dabf078b2681f00149542dc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastián Chávez","original_name":"Sebastián Chávez","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sebas","credit_id":"5dabf08bed28b90014da1ef3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Toledo","original_name":"Jonathan Toledo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5dabf09bed28b90012d9f7aa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Benega","original_name":"Simon Benega","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5dabf0a7ae36680012979923","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882283,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgardo González Amer","original_name":"Edgardo González Amer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dabf01eb2681f001495420c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882283,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgardo González Amer","original_name":"Edgardo González Amer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dabf02aae36680014978d3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11212436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"yotegustopeli","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPdw7Q8tGOUcu9BQyx7FrvOitJW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acxGPOsAyeUVZgVokS2KUzW9CKw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":914,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oEDMr71Of8pV4oWQLJbP7DmCDI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
