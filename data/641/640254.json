Portales was portrayed as an ambivalent character, similar to the current discussion about considering him as the man who organized the Republic or a ruthless tyrant. The story starts with the visit of the protagonist in his capacity as Minister of War and Navy to a military regiment in Quillota, which revolts and captures him. During his imprisonment, Portales narrates his life to his edec√°n, Eugenio Necochea, as the politician realizes that his death is every minute more accurate.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"History, Chile, Political, Historical","title":"Portales, la fuerza de los hechos.","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
