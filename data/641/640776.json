He goes to the bosom of nature, to a village where circus artists and their families have a holiday. The house of Vadim's friend, where he stays, turns out to be inhabited by fairy-tale creatures and miracles happen there. Music, dancing and fun never cease there. At first, the artist tries to seclude himself, but the mystic force penetrates through the closed doors and windows. Vadim has no choice but to join in the festivities. Vadim used to specialise in still lifes, but now he has decided to change his specialisation. Among the circus performers the artist finds a charming girl Taya - the face for his new painting.","popularity":0.1985,"poster_path":"/xtcJatCHzfdgmmBd8kv1Xgj22TX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1985-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Season of Miracles","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1026,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xtcJatCHzfdgmmBd8kv1Xgj22TX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1985-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
