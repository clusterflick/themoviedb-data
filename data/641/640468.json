Once, this area was protected by a thriving oil industry, but now, big companies are moving out and the logging industry is poised to move in. Ecotourism could be the only way to prevent the trees of this rainforest from coming down, but a team of conservationists needs to make the gorillas of Gabon tolerant of humans first. Follow them as they get up-close with the gorillas, study their moves, and journey to war-torn Central African Republic to learn the secrets of successful gorilla habituation.","popularity":0.3054,"poster_path":"/xRD17hklboUplzkjM4aUSBAGkks.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gorillas of Gabon","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oHgyrMHnAu1c9Pdlam0sFDZmJQp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eq9rq0hYgFLpREZlKjdfqMBYR4V.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xRD17hklboUplzkjM4aUSBAGkks.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":690,"name":"gorilla"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
