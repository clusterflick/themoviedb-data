Having been wrenched away from the country in which they had lived and from their children because they had no papers, they are found again in Senegal or Kosovo, in Gambia or Cameroun, destitute and cut off from their families, sometimes even having been tortured upon arrival. This film broaches the private lives of these broken men and testifies to the brutality of a migration policy that is common in Switzerland and in Europe.","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":"/dDqE72pR8x8CtFcMv9voCqrD2LP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21530,"logo_path":"/cEJO4W8D2eXoeaWz16PC9SkjxmN.png","name":"Climage","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le monde est comme ça","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714125,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Janka Rahm Melgar","original_name":"Janka Rahm Melgar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f39767e0f70083456f62","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"6332f2f3d7f465007d9bb5f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743954,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elise Shubs","original_name":"Elise Shubs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f31dd3d38700822af13b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310820,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christophe Giovannoni","original_name":"Christophe Giovannoni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f3e2cede69009235682b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérôme Cuendet","original_name":"Jérôme Cuendet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f3b0abdafc0081ab3a80","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"6332f331904f6d007f51bc12","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743954,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elise Shubs","original_name":"Elise Shubs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f3d0d3d38700822af179","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7611,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Denis Jutzeler","original_name":"Denis Jutzeler","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f357d3d387007d5b0f44","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Muret","original_name":"Claude Muret","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f381abdafc007cdab164","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945710,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Janine Waeber","original_name":"Janine Waeber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6332f36e67e0f70083456f50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"6332f33cd7f46500826699a4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"5dab1dad223a8b0015572984","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q56304993","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dDqE72pR8x8CtFcMv9voCqrD2LP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":690},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mtoXYZ1MUabboTKd7jhLacYd9Yi.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
