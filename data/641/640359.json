His life becomes austere and anonymous, with no major shocks until one day he wakes up from a nightmare inspired by the remorse that now, as inexorable ghosts, arise scratching his memory. From that moment on, torment becomes her stigma. Simultaneously in her story appears Liliana Suarez, a twenty-five year old woman who, after receiving the information about the whereabouts of the man who kidnapped her parents, decides to meet him, watch him, control him.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La trayectoria del silencio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romina Palmieri","original_name":"Romina Palmieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5da9cad53d3557000f6bf18a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodolfo Pesa","original_name":"Rodolfo Pesa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5da9cadb9661fc00143f0af6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Zanzio","original_name":"Jorge Zanzio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da9cab7126ec30017105c7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mercedes Falkenberg","original_name":"Mercedes Falkenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da9cac4126ec30017105c8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
