Even better than their all-conquering neighbours, Liverpool! They won the FA Cup, thrashed Man Utd 5-0, beat Liverpool, home and away, and then strolled to the league title with a record amount of points. They steamrollered the great Bayern Munich and won a first ever European trophy and, for a time, were probably the best side in Europe. We will never know for sure - because they couldn't prove it...  This is the tale of a man with Everton in his blood, a team intent on greatness and a city united in defiance. A story told by all the heroes of the day - the men that made history.","popularity":1.0623,"poster_path":"/x6myk2ianOMSxiCuC84ukSFS0k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toffee
