Keskidee were to act as a catalyst. the film shows some of their work and their response to the people they met.  Tribal elders try to show keskidee the depth of Maori roots in the land, and the complexity and pain of their present struggles: against the loss of Aroha; against the laws of pen and paper; the alienation of their land; the suppression of their language; the devaluation of their people and culture.","popularity":0.182,"poster_path":"/yXFOKgZiGFHTMjyDWyzXv4phY68.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scratch Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1979-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two cultures learn about each other as a black theatre group from London tours remote Maori communities in New Zealand.","title":"Keskidee Aroha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Sanderson","original_name":"Martyn Sanderson","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/hPpALGPDAP0J2UMirKyCaqCqBqB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5dac22023d3557000f712c55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merata Mita","original_name":"Merata Mita","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/t9D9XASTbaHkZ7ySgFF0KH3vTNB.jpg","credit_id":"5dac2159ae366800129837f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Sanderson","original_name":"Martyn Sanderson","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/hPpALGPDAP0J2UMirKyCaqCqBqB.jpg","credit_id":"5dac2165b2681f001495b95c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67118,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annie Collins","original_name":"Annie Collins","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac21dfb2681f0012950f82","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436822,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin Hayward","original_name":"Kevin Hayward","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac21d1b2681f0012950f55","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merata Mita","original_name":"Merata Mita","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/t9D9XASTbaHkZ7ySgFF0KH3vTNB.jpg","credit_id":"5dac217a3876510013dc9198","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Sanderson","original_name":"Martyn Sanderson","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/hPpALGPDAP0J2UMirKyCaqCqBqB.jpg","credit_id":"5dac216e3876510013dc9178","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merata Mita","original_name":"Merata Mita","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/t9D9XASTbaHkZ7ySgFF0KH3vTNB.jpg","credit_id":"5dac21853876510017dc6fc0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Sanderson","original_name":"Martyn Sanderson","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/hPpALGPDAP0J2UMirKyCaqCqBqB.jpg","credit_id":"5dac214ced28b90014dabf37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135290,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Westgate","original_name":"Mike Westgate","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7136844083b300179596f6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569420,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rod Cornelius","original_name":"Rod Cornelius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e713661cedac400175052ce","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":118140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nevan Rowe","original_name":"Nevan Rowe","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e713690357c000013474e35","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1018,"iso_639_1":"mi","file_path":"/yXFOKgZiGFHTMjyDWyzXv4phY68.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
