There is no story development like a normal story movie, and the image of only the author = the hero like a diary movie continues. There are no lines. The heroine-like existence is a dingy female stray cat. Still, I tried to brew and elaborate how to make a movie time of about one hour, like walking a tightrope, but over a long period of time. As a reference motif, there is Isao Yamada's early work \"Yomado\". The title \"Gootariputra\" is not a word with a specific meaning, but is just a coined word of  Lazy way of life.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/i75P5AroFg0tZmGlOjzgerZNPGL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GOOTARIPUTRA","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikio Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎幹夫","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/djBtyiHT9PMItgTkTVcjglqlIe7.jpg","credit_id":"5dab15fdb2681f001493798a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncVFgwNBgEcyR1TPsVq3chHlthi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q0ZqtaFkJMd6OrqF4DWb3BwfZXg.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":837},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i75P5AroFg0tZmGlOjzgerZNPGL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"La camera, Tokyo","release_date":"1999-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
