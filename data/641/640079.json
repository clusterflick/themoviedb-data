They love each other, despite the age difference. Seba is 37 years old, with a past made of petty crimes, and with Patty they share a passion for vintage 80's. Patty, to celebrate Seba's upcoming birthday, organizes a theme party with her closest friends. For the occasion, Seba has polished with great love a second-hand FIAT 127, a super mini car bought at a court auction. It's a seemingly perfect evening, everything goes as it should. At the end of the party, the two protagonists are secluded in a wood outside the city and, in the dark, as the anguish begins to rise, they feel observed by someone or something evil.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/qQ3ZZ9h9guk4Kaec89dke7rba2m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168713,"logo_path":null,"name":"SeDici Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":36085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tonino Abballe Communication","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter H","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2566750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulia Todaro","original_name":"Giulia Todaro","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/6KqQzaU6SKfpA8ovJwLnEwS5cVh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Patty","credit_id":"616cf5d6ba131b00434b7962","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1902043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Aceti","original_name":"Marco Aceti","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/xCScEKUnLpJp8bPkO8pdSBaBQtr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Seba","credit_id":"61a4dbf804863800297dd911","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596814,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paolo Buonpane","original_name":"Paolo Buonpane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a3630d6ebf4b7d4f5d52d9","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605521,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claudio D’Elia","original_name":"Claudio D’Elia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a362adc0464f59ee614338","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395662,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Massimo Filippini","original_name":"Massimo Filippini","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a362fbebbba87376ca9d4b","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3573128,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Massimiliano Baccella","original_name":"Massimiliano Baccella","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a362eaadc660b3fb267bd0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255977,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marco Iacomelli","original_name":"Marco Iacomelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a3631677b914fee85d908d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789634,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sara Tomarchio","original_name":"Sara Tomarchio","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a3633b58205f3dd6267d73","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco M.
