As her thoughts continue she becomes aware of the possibility that perhaps she never came here at all. Outside in the sun, the stillness changes the road, itâ€™s inherent notion of speed has dissipated, allowing the surface to be felt.  The film suggests ideas of non-activity and meditation, memory and perception. It explores the relationship between contemplation and the act of looking.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1lkG0YXSFB89BSOl1Wr6z5k5pKf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Someone Behind the Door Knocks at Irregular Intervals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Lowne","original_name":"James Lowne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dabd957ae36680012977197","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1lkG0YXSFB89BSOl1Wr6z5k5pKf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
