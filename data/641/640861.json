He meanders out at dawn towards a herd of feeding cows where his attempt to take the wheel for the morning’s feed-out run is quickly overruled by his overbearing father. Elliot’s resentment grows with his increasingly apparent lack of autonomy and respect on the farm. A routine grocery trip sees Elliot bump into Laura, an enigmatic checkout operator and love interest, who pockets Elliot a pouch of tobacco on the sly, directing him to collect her later on that afternoon.","popularity":0.2314,"poster_path":"/1ZDxtxMAnGJ54JUvoriOlX4Ivvk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gainsborough Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2017-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A reclusive teenage farmboy finds an unlikely source of inspiration to stand-up against his overbearing father.","title":"Thicket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Hamilton","original_name":"Tim Hamilton","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Elliot","credit_id":"5dac2c133d3557001670fd5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Tait","original_name":"Peter Tait","popularity":0.1727,"profile_path":"/pizbLpSObBReMNDi5RyJIJdEN62.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"John","credit_id":"5dac2c1e3876510013dca292","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2107052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albertine Jonas","original_name":"Albertine Jonas","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/7CwZeb40aee2oTcyuXACewb8u7D.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"5dac2c28ed28b90014dade3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Adams","original_name":"Mike Adams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Boss","credit_id":"5dac2c3b3876510013dca2c0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Ahearn","original_name":"Marguerite Ahearn","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5dac2c43b2681f0016955a8f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046899,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Grayson Gilmour","original_name":"Grayson Gilmour","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2b803876510013dca11f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044339,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Lord","original_name":"Richard Lord","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2b5eed28b90017dace7b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048801,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Buckton","original_name":"Nick Buckton","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2b8fed28b90017dacf41","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Vares","original_name":"Julian Vares","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2aceed28b90012da7cb9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Vares","original_name":"Julian Vares","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2ac7ae36680014980726","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193865,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Craig Gainsborough-Waring","original_name":"Craig Gainsborough-Waring","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2b32ed28b90012da7ff6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436850,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Abbey Vares","original_name":"Abbey Vares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2b9cb2681f001495e52f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382017,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eoin O’Liddigh","original_name":"Eoin O’Liddigh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dac2b48ae3668001797d538","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1093,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ZDxtxMAnGJ54JUvoriOlX4Ivvk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Zealand International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
