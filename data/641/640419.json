The film traces the redpoint—which transformed rock climbing from an engineering problem into a brilliant test of mental and physical strength—from its origins with a ragtag bunch of tights-wearing revolutionaries in rural Bavaria, to its golden era with Wolfgang Güllich, to its new ideal in the German phenom Megos as he battles to unlock new levels of human potential.","popularity":0.4883,"poster_path":"/tQAU0EtiL1CGLzppKIzlW6aOSto.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148014,"logo_path":"/sh5M67BZcLtrMkyX6sXTcg4ci2z.png","name":"Patagonia","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
