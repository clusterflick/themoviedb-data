Black and white photos are accompanied by realistic sound that brings the images to life. Endblum is a minimalist story about absence. In the only contemporary shot, contrasting with the archives, we see the interior of an empty synagogue - a dead place devoid of its original function.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endblum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wioletta Sowa","original_name":"Wioletta Sowa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a401ad2667780128647a06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorota Krakowska","original_name":"Dorota Krakowska","popularity":0.0622,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a401c42667780122647740","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
