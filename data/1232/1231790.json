She is compelled, by threats, to write a note to her husband, saying she does not love him. The husband enters, and reads the note. In spite of protestations of innocence, he refuses to believe her and tells her to leave his home for ever. Shortly after, a great bull-fight takes place, in which the guilty toreor is wounded.
