This centre was built in 1928. During the great depression, it helped a lot for the local people. In modern days, we have plenty of other problems, such as food waste, poverty, and isolation. This centre fights with all of that. Also, it invites all people, despite their disabilities, social groups, age, and gender and provides help and activities. This place is magical and hospitable.","popularity":0.2819,"poster_path":"/j7GrwqnfM0tFWP7cJZl66FdGfBP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Byker Community","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3202698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justina Mitkutė","original_name":"Justina Mitkutė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a68b2d85702e00c7c396d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30149568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j7GrwqnfM0tFWP7cJZl66FdGfBP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1497}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":309262,"name":"doc"},{"id":327534,"name":"byker community"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
