Worshippers at the local grotto saw the statue of the Virgin Mary come to life. Soon, thousands made the pilgrimage and—for a summer—the phenomenon gripped the country.  Almost forty years later, a handful of local devotees remain, including the statue’s dutiful caretaker Patrick Joseph Simms. Through Simms and a chorus of locals, the film documents both the mystical landscape of rural Irish Catholicism and a terrible darkness beneath its surface.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yyy9JkJN8tlp95UfCp22w9QMep2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am The Immaculate Conception","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483012,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Solomon Golding","original_name":"Solomon Golding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a582311fb94f00c974c6fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4185100,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Panayi","original_name":"Simon Panayi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a582590582240132fe0cf4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301003,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Marc Eck","original_name":"Jean-Marc Eck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a5824e60b58d013111abde","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595890,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Callum Bentley","original_name":"Callum Bentley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a582c1058224012ffe0d57","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3886187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Foster","original_name":"Harry Foster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a58241d05a0300caa9e947","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3114667,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Etienne Kompis","original_name":"Etienne Kompis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a5826260b58d012511b155","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483013,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Outhwaite","original_name":"Sophie Outhwaite","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a582980f2ae101305b62ab","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Eli Martin","original_name":"Frank Eli Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a5811d8a0e9b0131b49286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Eli Martin","original_name":"Frank Eli Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a581bb0f2ae101215b5f37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483014,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ciara McKenna","original_name":"Ciara McKenna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a582ac8289a000c0adb64e","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Eli Martin","original_name":"Frank Eli Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a581288dbc3301236a8d29","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483016,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Esther Solomon","original_name":"Esther Solomon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a582b48289a000c0adb65b","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1682,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yyy9JkJN8tlp95UfCp22w9QMep2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1122}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
