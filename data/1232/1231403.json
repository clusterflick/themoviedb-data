His parents trust him, his friends like him, girls are indifferent toward him. Then there's the girl he's watched from afar, Annie Briggs, who doesn't even know he exists. Until today. For today, the powers of fate conspire against him when jock friend Gary decides to throw a party at Charlie's house because the Brandis parents are away; a party specifically orchestrated to do one thing, put Charlie and Annie (who is unaware of this plan) together. The wrench comes in the form of Gary's older sister Margot, a girl who Charlie has also loved from afar, and who might be interested in him as well. The question is, when will Charlie stop doing things because other people want him to and take stock in his own situation.","popularity":0.2537,"poster_path":"/AgFGjVzuorbZVbu5pnKzPlDbadQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93784,"logo_path":null,"name":"MORE Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":119702,"logo_path":null,"name":"D Street Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Have I Ever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jared Winkler","original_name":"Jared Winkler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bQVNpwyNfKGNKBqvoaKiBoZ1DDr.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Charlie Brandis","credit_id":"65a511400582240123fde704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2182597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Rix","original_name":"Annie Rix","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/jeRXgploVlMoy2rkJLgjY0yux83.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Annie Briggs","credit_id":"65a511551fb94f00ba74a446","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2182601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Mikula","original_name":"Nick Mikula","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/jPP9NMyFS2UzCIBBiOrG14ffS6h.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Gary Tremain","credit_id":"65a511668a0e9b0122b46d7d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Kuen","original_name":"Kate Kuen","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Margot Tremain","credit_id":"65a511766476540122d6f1b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Preston Tate Jr.","original_name":"Preston Tate Jr.","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Josh Tobin","credit_id":"65a5118c1fb94f00c074a338","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Wiedelman","original_name":"Rick Wiedelman","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Danny Reiner","credit_id":"65a511a06476540128d6efe9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871125,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erica Lynn Schmeck","original_name":"Erica Lynn Schmeck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Tara Noonan","credit_id":"65a511b21a3248012f0484e2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2738167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kinga Rylend","original_name":"Kinga Rylend","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Kaylee Ferris","credit_id":"65a511c31a32480129048589","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Miller","original_name":"Jeremy Miller","popularity":0.2304,"profile_path":"/thNBy9PRqO3qXSio6i3hRpH7iQF.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Glenn Brandis","credit_id":"65a511e0058224012ffde651","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2182649,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David B.
