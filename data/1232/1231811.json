But this is a movie everyone needs to see. For the first time ever, hear the stories of covid shot deaths as told by the parents who lost their children.  Hear from the families brave enough to speak up and admit that the shot killed their children. Hear from the ones who have refused to keep quiet. We all know that there are so many who have sold out to pharma, denying that their loved ones were hurt or killed by the shots. But there is no amount of money or threats that can keep these parents from speaking truth in honor of their children…and so this doesn’t happen to one more child.","popularity":0.462,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":218503,"logo_path":null,"name":"We The Patriots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For the first time ever, hear the stories of covid shot deaths as told by the parents who lost their children.","title":"Shot Dead The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483685,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avery Kabrich","original_name":"Avery Kabrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a62539c525c40131f8b9eb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teryn Gregson","original_name":"Teryn Gregson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a624f903f0b600bbd5f76b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483685,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avery Kabrich","original_name":"Avery Kabrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a6255a9bcd0f012eba708c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483686,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason Kabrich","original_name":"Jason Kabrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a6256d17c443012d5a7c9d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483686,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason Kabrich","original_name":"Jason Kabrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a62546eb64f1012af4ffeb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162300,"name":"government cover-up"},{"id":238032,"name":"cover-up attempt"},{"id":273804,"name":"medical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
