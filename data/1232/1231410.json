As the alcohol begins pouring the group's tightly knit history begins to unravel. An ill-advised game of Never Have I Ever seems to bring the festivities to a screeching halt. As the group separates to deal with their various emotional drama, an intruder crashes the party to silence them all for good. In one night, a years old secret will come to the surface and fighting is the only means of survival. The truth hurts, but a knife hurts deeper.","popularity":0.2253,"poster_path":"/kYlx8B0T8NKVrGaRPEuCLI8WMD0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Make This a Movie Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Never Have I Ever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3742076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Blaylock","original_name":"Brett Blaylock","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"65a512dd8dbc3301296a6b1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Marie Olsen","original_name":"Heather Marie Olsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sasha","credit_id":"65a512f28dbc33012f6a6a6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Smolin","original_name":"Ben Smolin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Devin","credit_id":"65a512fc6476540122d6f22a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trace William Cowen","original_name":"Trace William Cowen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Max","credit_id":"65a5130b18b7510128960bb1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charitina Goebe","original_name":"Charitina Goebe","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jocelyn","credit_id":"65a5131960b58d01281189fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarrod Cuthrell","original_name":"Jarrod Cuthrell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Taylor","credit_id":"65a513288dbc33012f6a6a7e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3898010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Martin","original_name":"Donald Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Garrett","credit_id":"65a5134c0582240123fde7b4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellis Wilson Oswalt III","original_name":"Ellis Wilson Oswalt III","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ezrin","credit_id":"65a51361058224012cfde6b2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Kilgore","original_name":"Josh Kilgore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Marcus","credit_id":"65a5136d2d1e400130cdc3a4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Austin-Jones","original_name":"Ariel Austin-Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Brooklyn","credit_id":"65a51380d05a0300c4a9c6e8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Johnson","original_name":"Chad Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"65a51397058224012ffde6ea","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zachary Paul","original_name":"Zachary Paul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a513f118b7510122960d48","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zachary Paul","original_name":"Zachary Paul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a513ddd05a0300caa9c67d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jesse Lee","original_name":"Jesse Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a5140c058224012cfde707","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zachary Paul","original_name":"Zachary Paul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a513e81fb94f00c674a3d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2233454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kYlx8B0T8NKVrGaRPEuCLI8WMD0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12339,"name":"slasher"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
