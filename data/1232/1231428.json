People who have inherited their knowledge from their ancestors and whose practice shows that we have a living pharmacy within our reach, as long as we take care of nature.They are medicine men and women who propose “an initiatory journey”, a plea in favor of natural medicine. They also emphasize that the materialism and stress to which current society subjects us prevent us from searching for consciousness, leading us to distance ourselves from nature.  In this way, the documentary leads the viewer to reflect on the current health system. But it also tries to make people see that the great challenge is to once again be able to think about the common good, the Earth, our greatest provider of life.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":218446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ultreia!
