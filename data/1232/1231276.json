This process entailed a durational commitment to witnessing the presence of architectures and systems that are often hidden from everyday life.  The resulting film is a visual meditation that follows the cyclical rhythms of weather and industry to offer a portrait of New York City in relation to the forces that shape it, including late-stage capitalism and environmental crises.
