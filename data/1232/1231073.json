In 1991, IRONMAN began to package these stories into a documentary format, which has aired on broadcast television and streaming services every year since. This year’s IRONMAN World Championship special is no different. 2023 will chronicle one of triathlon’s pinnacle events, which, for the first time in the iconic event’s 45-year history, was hosted in two separate locations: the men in Nice, France, and the women in Kona, Hawaii.","popularity":0.1593,"poster_path":"/e60wBBgd9D2IZz0qgvoYmXVoZKR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218377,"logo_path":null,"name":"IRONMAN Group Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2023 IRONMAN World Championship Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480945,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Polloreno","original_name":"Julia Polloreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a3fb235a788400c0c960b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480951,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin LaClaire","original_name":"Kevin LaClaire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a3fb811f0275012408bdec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480943,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Messick","original_name":"Andrew Messick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a3fac839b6c300c777cafa","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480944,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthieu Van Veen","original_name":"Matthieu Van Veen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a3fae6d35dea012e431c1a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480948,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Godwin","original_name":"Steve Godwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a3fb6c39549a012f10c8a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2789,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e60wBBgd9D2IZz0qgvoYmXVoZKR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1860}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":327451,"name":"ironman"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
