It answers important questions which are likely to be asked about the fraternity. The video is designed exclusively for individual Masons to personally share with their friends. Those who seek membership in Freemasonry must do so voluntarily through a member of the fraternity. Please consider it the highest compliment that a Freemason has shared this video with you. It is a message of kindness... from Friend to Friend!
