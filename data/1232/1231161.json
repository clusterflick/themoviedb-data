Who will control the future of America’s news ecosystem: Wall Street billionaires concerned only with profit, or those who see journalism as an essential public service and the lifeblood of our democracy?","popularity":0.1605,"poster_path":"/7O8VvbIYZAhMsuXgYm3T1brG3uN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kovno Communications","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stripped for Parts: American Journalism on the Brink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4481256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Reynolds","original_name":"Julie Reynolds","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65a433f77d5f4b00c8b801fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3649267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Plunkett","original_name":"Chuck Plunkett","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/c11udBo75ZZAukOpM8lYbKlvCG3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65a43441bd588b01223b7801","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rick Goldsmith","original_name":"Rick Goldsmith","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/jV2u8R8Gc8Jt45xqH2dAArFowRy.jpg","credit_id":"65a42ff95a788400c0c96960","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4481253,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Kawana","original_name":"Lauren Kawana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a4335dfcec2e012dd5ecb5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rick Goldsmith","original_name":"Rick Goldsmith","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/jV2u8R8Gc8Jt45xqH2dAArFowRy.jpg","credit_id":"65a43368d35dea012b4328d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31835855","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"sforparts","instagram_id":"sforparts","twitter_id":"SForparts"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7O8VvbIYZAhMsuXgYm3T1brG3uN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4zQTxTnT7uCIa5oJnVYqdICcPOX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Santa Fe International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival ","release_date":"2024-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stripped for Parts - COMING SOON","key":"869249853","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-28T17:37:37.000Z","id":"65a433845690b50129b07647"}]}}}
