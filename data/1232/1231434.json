The large bluefin tuna crosses the Atlantic to spawn in the Mediterranean. During the months of May and June, large schools of tuna cross Gibraltar to reach the coasts of the province of Cádiz. For 21 days we have followed the fishermen of the coastal areas of Conil, Barbate and Zahara de los Atunes, learning with them what this ancient fishing means. Originally from the Phoenicians and still preserved the same. Manual, artisanal fishing, in which the fish is trapped through an underwater labyrinth of nets.  Many families from these coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula depend on the experience, wisdom and effort of these workers every year.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":218448,"logo_path":null,"name":"2 Brothers Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2015-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viento de atunes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfonso O'Donnell","original_name":"Alfonso O'Donnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a529500f2ae101275b40d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfonso O'Donnell","original_name":"Alfonso O'Donnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a529661fb94f00c374a8d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
