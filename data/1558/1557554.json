In part a portrait of Manhattan's constricted spaces, and more generally of the way humans occupy space, it also presents the failed journey of a self to organize, or become present in, the world ... I worked on this film between 1976 and 1984. It is super-8, color, silent, 18 fps, and in ten sections. All but one section is on a separate reel, and there are intended to be 40-second breaks between each reel, in darkness and silence, that are a planned part of the film. The eighth section is itself on three separate reels, each of them quite short, and the breaks between these reels should be a little shorter, about 20 seconds. With the breaks, the film runs about 105 minutes.\" - F.C.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hEBN0yYrtdQBsg3icQOILGZ12zB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3440891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Camper","original_name":"Fred Camper","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":"/wsCokAN39lweyg4rVhAox7Z8WAw.jpg","credit_id":"68e2786b3a0105698e9caa49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2142,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/hEBN0yYrtdQBsg3icQOILGZ12zB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1433}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
