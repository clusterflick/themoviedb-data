Drawn in by the allure of a wealthy livestream donor known only as \"Chameleon747\", they follow a trail of digital breadcrumbs to an abandoned parking lot. What begins as a reckless game for attention spirals into terror as an unseen predator emergesâ€”turning their feed into a stage for horror, and their viewers into complicit spectators. \"STALKER\" is a chilling exploration of digital voyeurism, toxic influence, and the price of online fame.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"horror","title":"STALKER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
