When stripped down to the essentials, a successful story needs engaging characters, an arc and something worth telling. Moose Run is a stop motion romp where circles, triangles and squares come together to make characters that have personalities, motivation and adventure. Using simple tools, this animated short illustrates the possibility of creating story and life with basic materials and free (or close to free) technology. Moose Run is an exploration of how to pare down embellishments and technical complexity to tell the simple story of an elderly lady, a moose and their unlikely yet endearing friendship, and the adventure they go on through the magic of collage and animation.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/35i5Q7lhKQSUiTu9HSHqcXxjC0s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moose Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine De Vuono","original_name":"Christine De Vuono","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1647ad7806157afc21eb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/35i5Q7lhKQSUiTu9HSHqcXxjC0s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
