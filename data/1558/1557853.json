When he survives he plots revenge.In 2006 Helgeland’s darker original version was eventually released on DVD as Payback: Straight Up – The Director’s Cut, which also deviates quite a lot from the original novel but is much closer to its nihilistic tone. The last 30 minutes is a completely new showdown between Porter and the Outfit’s henchmen at a subway station that is much closer to the finale of the original novel (and it’s almost certainly fatal intent). This tougher, less romantic, film is also much shorter and works infinitely better on its own terms and as an adaptation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oyf9vsBHk1FmKQ77AJhef1ryL1S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's back with a Vengeance!","title":"Payback: Straight Up – The Director’s Cut","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Gibson","original_name":"Mel Gibson","popularity":4.3219,"profile_path":"/yk7t6dXTxThonouyBLI7Sjd1xzG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Porter","credit_id":"68e31861c13bb5ad7f36e89d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Henry","original_name":"Gregg Henry","popularity":2.0805,"profile_path":"/j17nuAFulrbYP34g4Qw8SZRDNUo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Val Resnick","credit_id":"68e318aee1775f9c0ec27446","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bello","original_name":"Maria Bello","popularity":3.6913,"profile_path":"/it1f5mxiGIWO0DzTBfwtLTjphZb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rosie","credit_id":"68e318c814ba9edbf836e7c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Paymer","original_name":"David Paymer","popularity":1.507,"profile_path":"/owoOdDFgXpls1OFKwmQ104Nkl5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Arthur Stegman","credit_id":"68e318f795e6715b2ff8196b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Duke","original_name":"Bill Duke","popularity":1.6454,"profile_path":"/hZrYPwer5PeK77OEILkNWHVb3ss.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Detective Hicks","credit_id":"68e319261e7f7201b29cabcd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Kara Unger","original_name":"Deborah Kara Unger","popularity":1.5258,"profile_path":"/kPhYhisjduJ9ztFSwYQ6Ke6qeJy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lynn Porter","credit_id":"68e31986feaba716a9f81b81","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1408,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oyf9vsBHk1FmKQ77AJhef1ryL1S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
