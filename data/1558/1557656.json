Benas Sarkas is the avant-garde, the artist; the man and the bird. When asked who he is, Benas' answer sounds like the quote from Shakespeare's play - \"I am the mortal composition of clay and water.\" It is hard to catch any signs of daily routine in his life or to listen to a philosophical monologue. The creation is the only way of communication. Only the story about the way he creates can draw the portrait of Benas.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magpie 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mykolas Vild탑i큰nas","original_name":"Mykolas Vild탑i큰nas","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/7yNlcDdQ6hVNgFh2B45CGDYvofO.jpg","credit_id":"68e2a8918dba4d8e56bd962b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2448902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
