Of the sun and soil and bees, of the water and black ants and cowpeas. To be so entangled with an ecosystem, generation after generation, that nature and culture become one? Clans living in Tharaka, Kenya, have been subjected to colonialism and all that follows. Their indigeneity unthreaded by a powerful few pulling the world apart for profit. But Atharaka – ‘those of Tharaka’ – are remembering the power in their identity. Beside the Kithino River, they are reviving customs and enabling nature to regenerate: rethreading a complex biocultural system that brings balance, autonomy, and joy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oG2b7OmkZZODPUsk0klchLVWdvs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"2025-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atharaka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brennie Muthoni","original_name":"Brennie Muthoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68e2517bdd68fcfd46f8166c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salome Gatumi","original_name":"Salome Gatumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68e251830c25d33785c2223e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mbura M'Rugia","original_name":"Mbura M'Rugia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68e25188698ac5bbc9c26f82","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mutegi M'Mwaria","original_name":"Mutegi M'Mwaria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68e2518fcd36ff9cabc26fce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gitongo Chabari","original_name":"Gitongo Chabari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68e251951984999f4b25b020","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Mitambo","original_name":"Simon Mitambo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e2512f20c52a740cc26f7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730760,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andy Pilsbury","original_name":"Andy Pilsbury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e25171e1775f9c0ec26ff3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/y12Z3mgJwf6unyYUs1qUYbcKAlR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_3166_1":"TZ","iso_639_1":"sw","file_path":"/oG2b7OmkZZODPUsk0klchLVWdvs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195405,"name":"indigenous community"},{"id":273853,"name":"climate action"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sw","note":"African Film Festival New Zealand","release_date":"2025-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sw","note":"World Culture Film Festival, Los Angeles, CA","release_date":"2025-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sw","note":"Climate Film Festival, NY","release_date":"2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
