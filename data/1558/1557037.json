Slapstick, romance, tragedy, comedy--it's all here in an entertaining sampling of what audiences have applauded down the years. You see the audiences too, and the theatres where early movies first drew in the fans. As guide you could hardly find a more knowledgeable or familiar figure than Walter Pidgeon, a Canadian with eighty or more films to his credit. He recalls the personalities of the great stars he has known and explains how the technology developed that shows the stars on the screen.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anniversary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Pidgeon","original_name":"Walter Pidgeon","popularity":0.5659,"profile_path":"/bzSDciaTy9vshH4Rguyu5elcSR7.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself - Host","credit_id":"68e13babfd6add34fec26a33","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Dressler","original_name":"Marie Dressler","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/xRsxCFcdo30PKDhRWXlk8Idwljl.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Herself - Archive Footage (uncredited)","credit_id":"68e13c41d715164943f80ff6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Huston","original_name":"Walter Huston","popularity":0.3554,"profile_path":"/yLhqfB99005d2nS7CIkwWO4qzmP.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Himself - Archive Footage (uncredited)","credit_id":"68e13c51698ac5bbc9c26a2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6483,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Herself - Archive Footage (uncredited)","credit_id":"68e13c675ed0b00b89960d74","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Shearer","original_name":"Norma Shearer","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/y9UuVsv4Wif8tqOdrLxSOfLNyW5.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Herself - Archive Footage (uncredited)","credit_id":"68e13c7e25ccefcc6d9ca338","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123023,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Weintraub","original_name":"William Weintraub","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13963926f04632836dcad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123023,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Weintraub","original_name":"William Weintraub","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e139862be556d05b960e65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Balla","original_name":"Nicholas Balla","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e139a428db88a8ea960eed","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ron Alexander","original_name":"Ron Alexander","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e139d9af06b97b32960d9b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3968798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marguerite Payette","original_name":"Marguerite Payette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e139f4ddb950ce8d36dc6a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637277,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Norman Bigras","original_name":"Norman Bigras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13a0a8dba4d8e56bd8ef8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123023,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Weintraub","original_name":"William Weintraub","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13a1a28db88a8ea960ef2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229386,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tony Lower","original_name":"Tony Lower","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13a58f54a5487f9960e07","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre L'Amare","original_name":"Pierre L'Amare","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13abff203abf7d7960e5d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5728872,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kenneth Horn","original_name":"Kenneth Horn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13b58f6d32fab28bd8e13","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
