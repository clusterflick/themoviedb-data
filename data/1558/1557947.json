It is early evening but already pitch black as a group of young men in their early twenties make their way along winding mountain paths to the houses of the young women they hope to woo. In an age of mobile phones and dating apps, one wonders what makes young people carry on this tradition of tea and talk in draughty rooms after a hard day’s work, with nothing but firelight and the promise of love to keep them going. There’s plenty of warmth as we watch three young men put their sweet-talking skills to the test – with sometimes tender, sometimes hilarious results. A cozy fire may be all these youngsters need to ignite romance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dating in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
