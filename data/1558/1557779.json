But for the past week, Shigeko has been absent from practice. Her father has fallen ill, and to support her family’s struggling finances, she has secretly taken a job at a trading company.  When Masao discovers this, he asks Midori to convince her to return, but soon the school learns of her secret. The students rally to raise funds, though the principal refuses their help, promising instead to handle the situation himself.  Shigeko resumes training and travels to Tokyo for the qualifying meet. She touches the wall first in the 100-meter freestyle—only to receive news of her father’s passing. Overcome with grief, she collapses, cared for by Midori, whose own exhaustion leaves her finishing fourth.  Despite these hardships, their prior accomplishments earn them a place on Japan’s Olympic team.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/89Du4hIRtnm7yBtflyUVj4n0Ycn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":162635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shochiku Kinema (Kamata)","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1932-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shine, Japanese Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kagayake Nihon Josei","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kinuyo Tanaka","original_name":"田中絹代","popularity":0.6837,"profile_path":"/1OnULAXSOskknSCxTzx3Naqoe5O.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Shigeko","credit_id":"68e2df811ae2ff89c1bd9992","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1093454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sumiko Mizukubo","original_name":"水久保澄子","popularity":0.1994,"profile_path":"/mfSOF1Nfv2kh5bSVT1YwcAXOEOs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Midori","credit_id":"68e2df8a0d591d58eef817ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukichi Iwata","original_name":"岩田祐吉","popularity":0.217,"profile_path":"/dFh3CqfOHz7RiUOkZZhhq0I2qs9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Principal","credit_id":"68e2dff7e1775f9c0ec27380","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideo Takeda","original_name":"武田春郎","popularity":0.2447,"profile_path":"/y6XUy2AuZhJvIR3ME4msboRZbln.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Shigeko's Father","credit_id":"68e2e0111e7f7201b29cab17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tokuji Kobayashi","original_name":"小林十九二","popularity":0.2231,"profile_path":"/twYMMpXN8ZoaSHzMnt1Vmq2NLMZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68e2e0dd47e9178da1c22757","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shoichi Kofujita","original_name":"小藤田正一","popularity":0.2258,"profile_path":"/uAVVahgRjZsVXyK95rkSlfNew41.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Brother","credit_id":"68e2e13b27d2caa3be25b3db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryōtarō Mizushima","original_name":"水島亮太郎","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/wzoUMJ9PzrQF47NeTUbuzkHhap8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68e2e151c10160a47fc271d3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiromasa Nomura","original_name":"野村浩将","popularity":1.8649,"profile_path":"/6yzBbJ1YeuFE1dV9slNx16sggE4.jpg","credit_id":"68e2e1830c55a0bc6ef81885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1087701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ayame Mizushima","original_name":"Ayame Mizushima","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/gWPoI8eV9KRMpNL18tBeyvs1NTk.jpg","credit_id":"68e2e195fa536d7f6fc27309","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131010,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kōgo Noda","original_name":"Kōgo Noda","popularity":0.2523,"profile_path":"/gK4hSppQWVZab0Y1LL4pg7UcSsf.jpg","credit_id":"68e2e19f9895836ecf25b240","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1087701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ayame Mizushima","original_name":"Ayame Mizushima","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/gWPoI8eV9KRMpNL18tBeyvs1NTk.jpg","credit_id":"68e2e1ac95e6715b2ff818c7","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4638088,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yokichi Takahashi","original_name":"Yokichi Takahashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e2e1bcbead25820c9cac23","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/89Du4hIRtnm7yBtflyUVj4n0Ycn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1932-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
