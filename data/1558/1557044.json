This animated video collage serves as a survival guide and an ode to the imaginations that protect us.  Statement from Daniel Lobb, the Director: Our performance is first and foremost a resource for people who are isolated in unsupportive homes. It presents self-preservation strategies to those who rely on media and imagination to withstand in potentially abusive environments.  The composition is based on the writer, Lexie Bean, growing up as queer, trans, and a survivor of incest in Michigan and Ohio, which we’ve all processed through our respective art forms. These iterations of inspiration and reformation ultimately led us to a video collage and sound-score that seek to buoy the main text: an ode to imagination, a scavenger hunt, a survival guide.  Our hope is to bolster the viewer’s capacity for imaginative resilience.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/i60TJaBuI76uaVyebsDCrO00T2u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Scavenger Hunt For People Loneliest In Their Own Homes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2858959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lexie Bean","original_name":"Lexie Bean","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/rk3Tgh4reHPyVMMlEVSe44oY86i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68e13f33a69ef94b4225aad9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5728900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Lobb","original_name":"Daniel Lobb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13d86f5912f69589ca48b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2858959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lexie Bean","original_name":"Lexie Bean","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/rk3Tgh4reHPyVMMlEVSe44oY86i.jpg","credit_id":"68e13d9c103955aa99f80fb2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1733472,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexis Marsh","original_name":"Alexis Marsh","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13dc7d715164943f81008","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5728908,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Dorff Jr.","original_name":"Daniel Dorff Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e13de7f2f33241f6bd8e9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14816692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2346,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/i60TJaBuI76uaVyebsDCrO00T2u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2754,"name":"trauma"},{"id":5707,"name":"childhood trauma"},{"id":11925,"name":"domestic violence"},{"id":264551,"name":"child sexual abuse"},{"id":308814,"name":"autofiction"},{"id":350503,"name":"incest rape"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Scavenger Hunt for People Loneliest in their Own Homes","key":"CYgBylqUV64","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-12-11T18:45:30.000Z","id":"68e13ef72be556d05b960e8c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Scavenger Hunt for People Loneliest in Their Own Homes","key":"441374614","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-24T15:53:06.000Z","id":"68e13ff50d591d58eef80f5a"}]}}}
