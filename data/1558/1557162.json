At no point do they look at each other. We don’t know why. They don’t acknowledge their rather… interesting attire. We don’t know why. But what they do is talk- about life, London, and pigeons.  Having moved from France and a small English village, the girls have long dreamed of coming to the city. But now that they’re here, they’ve found themselves lost in the smoke. Zoe and Lady must push through the loneliness they both feel, and perhaps, in doing so, realise that yes - they are lonely in London. But they are lonely together.  Flying Duo explores what it means to live in a new country, and the loneliness of migrating to a big city.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Zoe and Lady have finally followed their dream and moved to the big smoke, but when they get lost in the fog they must face what it means to be lonely - together.","title":"Flying Duo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3820479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charly Faye","original_name":"Charly Faye","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/w0MaHNB1qVTuGFj6GG596rVpLc1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Zoe","credit_id":"68e172bc103955aa99f8115c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4731797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Brunet-Campain","original_name":"Emma Brunet-Campain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lady","credit_id":"68e172d0c13bb5ad7f36dfa2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Sá","original_name":"Sofia Sá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pigeon","credit_id":"68e172f6e0751e69abc21fef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Pardy","original_name":"Adam Pardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tiger","credit_id":"68e17308b5568dabc3c26a96","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AJ Prior","original_name":"AJ Prior","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Moon Man","credit_id":"68e173193a0105698e9ca604","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Nelson","original_name":"Alex Nelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Spicy mustard","credit_id":"68e17330feaba716a9f81257","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5307856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Evans","original_name":"Harry Evans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/A4cjtsLwL1UzsN318LQjWL6jmFT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Violet","credit_id":"68e17347987a50689dbd8f09","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4731800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Blair","original_name":"Nicola Blair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cool Mum","credit_id":"68e17358848d40f34c36de66","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gibbs","original_name":"Robert Gibbs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Prisoner","credit_id":"68e1736876040052a9c21eed","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Marsden","original_name":"Sophie Marsden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"68e173806c29ab3c95bd8eb9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robyn Faye","original_name":"Robyn Faye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1739afd6add34fec26b46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4731797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Brunet-Campain","original_name":"Emma Brunet-Campain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e173b40c55a0bc6ef810c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3820479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charly Faye","original_name":"Charly Faye","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/w0MaHNB1qVTuGFj6GG596rVpLc1.jpg","credit_id":"68e173c5e26788236d6172f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liam Beazley","original_name":"Liam Beazley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e17405af06b97b32960ea5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AJ Prior","original_name":"AJ Prior","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1741cfd8100940ec21ea5","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4761544,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Ayers","original_name":"Matt Ayers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1747789b1b9bab0c21eab","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
