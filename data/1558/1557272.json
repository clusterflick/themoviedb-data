Electofrenia, signifying the chaos of the elections, proposes that many Venezuelans select the candidate who benefits them personally rather than the one who is good for the country at large. Not without irony, the film brings up Venezuela's two decades of peaceful democratic government. If people choose what is good for them, can we call it a democracy?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kWkEfCzsEPA4H8qN7vHuDYFILSE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electofrenia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5729660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julio Neri","original_name":"Julio Neri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/79TL6cnlslPtQUkZcPRMXjkSGhJ.jpg","credit_id":"68e19b6f039d42b270bd900f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0079099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/kWkEfCzsEPA4H8qN7vHuDYFILSE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":430,"name":"venezuela"},{"id":316605,"name":"elections"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
