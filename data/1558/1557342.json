Through visceral contemporary movement, the film unravels the tension between nourishment and destruction, love and suffocation. Inspired by the Ouroboros, the choreography unfolds in a labyrinthine setting, where the daughter desperately seeks escape, only to find herself inevitably drawn back. The visual language plays with the abjectâ€”orange gelatin evoking amniotic fluid, fractured reflections, and tactile imagery that blurs the boundaries between bodies. It is not just about gluttony; it is about inheritance, identity, and the inescapable hunger for connection.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yi0Kp7wMbV0vjsvrWxbupjLVwZe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gluttony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alena Krutskikh","original_name":"Alena Krutskikh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"68e1e20af0e07989ed9ca69b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alina Krutskikh","original_name":"Alina Krutskikh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"68e1e216dd68fcfd46f814b2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Paz Serra Parriego","original_name":"Maria Paz Serra Parriego","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e23036ab2141bc6173f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Paz Serra Parriego","original_name":"Maria Paz Serra Parriego","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e23bb0f6f9fe21617532","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729963,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paula Spera","original_name":"Paula Spera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e24de26788236d61757f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729964,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jo Berrojalbiz","original_name":"Jo Berrojalbiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e259953d5a78f525ae95","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729965,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Leo Paulucci","original_name":"Leo Paulucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e26d04adf86838f81365","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729966,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julieta Olivieri","original_name":"Julieta Olivieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e28252669dab81f8136b","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729964,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jo Berrojalbiz","original_name":"Jo Berrojalbiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e296f5265ffc28bd9154","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729967,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adriano Vaninni","original_name":"Adriano Vaninni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e2a30d591d58eef812b7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729968,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Demian Erasmo","original_name":"Demian Erasmo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1e2af60d45edfa961744b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1513,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/yi0Kp7wMbV0vjsvrWxbupjLVwZe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1009}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":289206,"name":"screendance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF SCREENDANCE","release_date":"2025-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
