When a string of increasingly bizarre crimes rocks the town—a panty theft epidemic, illegal moonshine being sold to children, and missing racehorses turning up in Chinese food—Jim is forced to unravel a tangled conspiracy involving local weirdos, an unstable sheriff, and a shadowy notebook that seems to connect it all. Soon, Jim will have to face his ultimate fear: actual police work.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1BMrsSyrQOl6p1tRgMZSLCYYL1M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-27","revenue":726,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Justice, unfiltered.","title":"Florence PD: The Jim Wolowitz Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5729109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Danner","original_name":"Trevor Danner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/a0qH3A8tVklnqZvVR321afkZK5Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim Wolowitz","credit_id":"68e1593fa61c881a81f810a3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5729109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Danner","original_name":"Trevor Danner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/a0qH3A8tVklnqZvVR321afkZK5Z.jpg","credit_id":"68e15725cd36ff9cabc26bea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5729109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Danner","original_name":"Trevor Danner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/a0qH3A8tVklnqZvVR321afkZK5Z.jpg","credit_id":"68e15953e1736b9e9d9ca386","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2304,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/1BMrsSyrQOl6p1tRgMZSLCYYL1M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1415,"name":"small town"},{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":8201,"name":"satire"},{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":189402,"name":"crime investigation"},{"id":207199,"name":"police department"},{"id":297139,"name":"absurdist humor"},{"id":322268,"name":"comedy"},{"id":357556,"name":"rural america"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
