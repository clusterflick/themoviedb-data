The artist implores participants to participate in an apocalyptic journey, where everyone will discover a clash between old, familiar shapes and alien, otherworldly life forms. The process of evolution, advanced technologies, and empyreal life forms – these fantastical plot elements may remind one of Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey”, but the artist himself says that he was more influenced by the aesthetic of music videos by the Scottish electronic music duo “Boards of Canada”.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Pagan Rites","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5135022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rimas Sakalauskas","original_name":"Rimas Sakalauskas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e2ae6181ddbbc250f8171f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
