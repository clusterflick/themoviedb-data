The locals used to make a living thanks to the chemical plant, which was virtually a monopoly employer in the region. Subsequently however the plant was closed and the locals made redundant. Nevertheless they refused to give up, and proceded to craft imaginative artworks from cardboard, metal and other materials left behind by the factory, soon transforming the city into a new Ukrainian centre for modern art. That it could have turned out this way is illustrated by this pseudo-documentary, in which interviews with fictitious locals, videos and archive images of the factory create a pretence of authenticity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Svetlograd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Світлоград","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Светлоград","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Yakubenko","original_name":"Alina Yakubenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e17686a6d59286aebd8f22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5729350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Yakubenko","original_name":"Alina Yakubenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e1768cb683c4ec089ca482","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FilmFestival Cottbus","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
