Part of a future full-length project, the short film presents a day in the household in which Maria and her son, Dinca, serve as slaves. As important guests arrive for dinner and all the slaves are making preparations, Maria and her son see this day as a chance to take a step to change their fate. During slavery time, up until 1856, the Romanian equivalent of the word \"forgiveness\" was used when referring to freeing someone from slavery (the Roma slave was \"forgiven\" from slavery).","popularity":0.1428,"poster_path":"/rYW250TiJMSpLSbbIacAbvcTL1K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5545,"logo_path":"/A9JHyYxaCXaxqsVQCw9kRsrwqNm.png","name":"Mobra
