Janey found fame for her sweary anti-Trump placards and became a social media sensation as she revoiced First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s Covid briefings. 'First I was cancelled, then I got cancer,' Janey notes as she recalls being called out for racist historic tweets, apologising and then trying to rebuild her career before receiving her diagnosis. That didn’t stop her from going on tour and director John Archer interweaves fly-on-the-wall footage with interviews from people such as Jimmy Carr, Nicola Sturgeon, and Janey's daughter, Ashley, that reveal details of a difficult Glasgow childhood.","popularity":0.4141,"poster_path":"/AaySzE3NkiqPYkTjaTFjgAICkWq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13788,"logo_path":"/dNLCLFvMac9l8xIBhKOyJKfef7u.png","name":"Hopscotch Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Janey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1990025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janey Godley","original_name":"Janey Godley","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/l0XToe3lofRtnbZkEp1TZpXBV8J.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e8bfa312425c01861c4f90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1616196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Storrie","original_name":"Ashley Storrie","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/mXrn5vV5eXVZRfslbbthmB6cM6q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6725521096d11f81d4f821c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2187613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Sturgeon","original_name":"Nicola Sturgeon","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/nKK61RSqix9K8qXsfMUcCfArSP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e8bfbfcb5c8e01867e701e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Carr","original_name":"Jimmy Carr","popularity":0.5526,"profile_path":"/xfEer8eO6rUrpuctvMrJtseYJcR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e8bfb5713ea6017c52effa","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4576436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Archer","original_name":"John Archer","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e8bf67713ea6016352ece2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4576436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Archer","original_name":"John Archer","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e8bf7263e6fb0162365f4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31050630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1777,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AaySzE3NkiqPYkTjaTFjgAICkWq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Glasgow Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
