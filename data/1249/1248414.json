And we ride with law enforcement as they discover migrant corpses, up to four a week during the hot summer months. I think it soon becomes clear why so many people are losing their lives.\" \"The Real Death Valley\" was produced by the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning team of Solly Granatstein and Shawn Efran for Weather Films, the award-winning digital documentary unit of weather.com.","popularity":0.1551,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":119751,"logo_path":"/jnJ4KrOrsALbk2qKKMYxN8Dx2Z8.png","name":"Efran Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":67828,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Weather Channel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Death Valley: The Untold Story of Mass Graves and Migrant Deaths in South Texas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550504,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brandon Keiffer","original_name":"Brandon Keiffer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b2fce6d3cc0162c065bf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550507,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucian Read","original_name":"Lucian Read","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b3cd25cd8501637e4966","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933102,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nathan Matthew David","original_name":"Nathan Matthew David","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b3f7ffd44d01872bf4d7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2960175,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Neil Katz","original_name":"Neil Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b34ae6d3cc017bc197cb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3558959,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shawn Efran","original_name":"Shawn Efran","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b32ee6d3cc0162c065f3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3232748,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Solly Granatstein","original_name":"Solly Granatstein","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b37eb04605016108d247","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3558959,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shawn Efran","original_name":"Shawn Efran","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b2d29974ee017b05f768","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550505,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Gilderman","original_name":"Greg Gilderman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b368e6d3cc017bc19808","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3232748,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Solly Granatstein","original_name":"Solly Granatstein","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b2b8c5c1ef017d8b7a66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marisa Venegas","original_name":"Marisa Venegas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b398c8a5ac017be301d0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4424288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
