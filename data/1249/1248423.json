This documentary tells the wonderful and often weird story of how hormones were discovered.  Presenter John Wass, one the country's leading experts on hormones, relates some amazing stories - how as recently as the 19th century boys were castrated to keep their pure soprano voice, how juices were extracted from testicles in the hope they would rejuvenate old men and how true medical heroes like Frederick Banting discovered a way to make insulin, thus saving the lives of countless diabetes sufferers.","popularity":0.1455,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":221425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sparkdocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Castration to Cure: How Scientists Discovered Hormones With Brutal Experimentation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1108356,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andy Jackson","original_name":"Andy Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/56IIoeLDU5TSq6QiZTfsyfq43Q4.jpg","credit_id":"65d6b5f9c5c1ef01648b266d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629113,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Moratiel","original_name":"John Moratiel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b62a5ca70401630d627f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047318,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Sen","original_name":"Paul Sen","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":"/kWg9WNC3Y5NudtahlQbAQoX5Nzm.jpg","credit_id":"65d6b6bbc8a5ac0162e1d8de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Sandy","original_name":"James Sandy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6b7002441820149aedbf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
