They seem to be in a somnambulistic state, either awake, asleep, existing, or not. In parallel with Turgenev's text, on counterpoint, the director unfolds his visual range, which enters into an obvious contradictory relationship with the words of the classic. The interaction of the characters on stage is absolutely independent of the author's remarks. Thus, Mirzoev visibly shades the intimate, to some extent Freudian motifs he saw in the play. However, Turgenev's text and Mirzoev's plastic searches turn \"Two Women\" into a curious stage experiment, rather unexpected for the aesthetics of Lenkom.","popularity":0.1488,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2004-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Chonishvili","original_name":"Сергей Чонишвили","popularity":0.3868,"profile_path":"/hSlZtLN6yj4kFJB7Qzl7POuanIP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65d6901aed2ac2017c3589c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":566708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yelena Shanina","original_name":"Елена Шанина","popularity":0.1784,"profile_path":"/o6Vy4KkOil0er9biMs5ezqF2MdL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65d69024c5c1ef017d8b2ee2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariya Mironova","original_name":"Мария Миронова","popularity":0.3978,"profile_path":"/sS1KCWTpIi0wPqrzSoiBxeeG3nW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65d6902fe6d3cc017bc12b13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitriy Pevtsov","original_name":"Дмитрий Певцов","popularity":0.2458,"profile_path":"/5A5okiCbXhrTDhn2kNYe29fkOJP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65d69038b04605016108abef","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Mirzoev","original_name":"Владимир Мирзоев","popularity":0.2582,"profile_path":"/tqN1g035NXO2oULr8uKPxgy3May.jpg","credit_id":"65d6900db04605016108ab35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
