He is the artist that everyone wants to work with – the singer’s singer who sings with 15 bands, including the ARIA award-winning Melbourne Ska Orchestra.  Born in the UK to Jamaican parents, Pat left the racism of the UK as soon as he could, although he ‘stupidly’ found his way to Australia with its own racism issues. Father to four children from different mothers with varying ethnic backgrounds, Pat’s children all identify differently and discuss racism and where identity comes from.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":186881,"logo_path":null,"name":"f-reel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"With a career that spans over four decades and across the globe, Jamaican singer Pat Powell (Patou) is one of Australia's most accomplished yet hidden vocal talents.","title":"PATOU: In Black & White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552101,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark Street","original_name":"Mark Street","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b7b291f0ea0185e69d50","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Cochrane","original_name":"Fiona Cochrane","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b7115f6c490162c6890d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382837,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chris Cochrane-Friedrich","original_name":"Chris Cochrane-Friedrich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b7de798e0601896d4ae1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552101,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark Street","original_name":"Mark Street","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b81c5f6c490185c6a3e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552109,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ska Vendors","original_name":"Ska Vendors","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b8523e09f30163b4cdd3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sioux Currie","original_name":"Sioux Currie","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b74b5f6c490185c6a33f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382837,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chris Cochrane-Friedrich","original_name":"Chris Cochrane-Friedrich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b7f25f6c490148c67a57","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552105,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Muir","original_name":"David Muir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b80c5f6c490185c6a3d0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552106,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Thomas","original_name":"Keith Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b82c91f0ea0162e68540","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552107,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pat Powell Band","original_name":"Pat Powell Band","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b83e00bfe8014858c462","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Cochrane","original_name":"Fiona Cochrane","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b71d3e09f30163b4cd78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21379394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PATOU: IN BLACK & WHITE trailer","key":"723378795","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-06-23T14:15:27.000Z","id":"65d7b68fce9e910163b77f58"}]}}}
