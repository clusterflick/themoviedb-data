He made his life between Berlin and Dusseldorf in the 1970s and then turned to creating monumental bronzes before returning to Congo at the invitation of President Sassou Ngesso in the early 1980s. Author of monumental bronze sculptures erected in the public squares of Brazzaville from the 1980s, his emblematic works of the Congolese capital disappeared during the events of 1997.
