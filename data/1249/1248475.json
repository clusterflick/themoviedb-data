In October 1961, 13 first graders became some of the smallest pioneers of the Civil Rights Movement when they desegregated the Memphis City Schools. ‘The Memphis 13’ is their story. This documentary collects the stories of 13 families united by a comment moment in history, but experiences individually; stories of normal children living through an extraordinary moment. A half century later, they are proud of having broken a barrier, but many remain burdened by this difficult experience. The film uncovers a hidden story of the Movement, honors the children who lived it, and raises questions about the role of children in movements for social change.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Memphis 13","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.C.
