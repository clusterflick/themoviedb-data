Artists with disability, both mental and physical, consistently face discrimination, inequity, and underexposure at both local and national levels. This film aims to de-stigmatize an underrepresented demographic of artists as it tells the four unique stories of Malcolm Corley, Adam Musser, Sybil Roe Thompson and David Nolt who create as a means to communicate and express how art shapes and impacts their lives.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Life Like This","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Corley","original_name":"Malcolm Corley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d7b50a3e09f30186b4d04a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Musser","original_name":"Adam Musser","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d7b513a57d43017c8a6572","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Nolt","original_name":"David Nolt","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d7b51ab33903016146aebb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sybil Roe Thompson","original_name":"Sybil Roe Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d7b5213e09f30186b4d05d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974533,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","original_name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b56291f0ea0162e68478","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552087,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Creason","original_name":"William Creason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b58aa57d43017c8a65dd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552086,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","original_name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b576b33903016146aefa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552086,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","original_name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b57ca57d43017c8a65ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4552086,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","original_name":"Jim Hollenbaugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d7b56ca57d43017c8a65bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27428191","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Life Like This (2023) (Trailer) - a film by James Hollenbaugh","key":"793499707","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-27T21:40:21.000Z","id":"65d7b4c1a57d43017c8a6540"}]}}}
