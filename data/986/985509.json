The festival lasts for a week day and night, with processions, drumming, singing, dancing and games with the bulls. The major representation of St. Ignatius' victory involves 12 \"warriors of the sun\" wearing extraordinary feathers and fighting against the guardians of the sacred flag, the ancient masters of the forest and water, before defeating them and converting them to Christianity.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amazonia - La Loma Santa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1911861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lia Beltrami","original_name":"Lia Beltrami","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/jWKEv5Tl1lBWZDydpKz2ETqyTrd.jpg","credit_id":"62a0c24dd2147c117da852b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
