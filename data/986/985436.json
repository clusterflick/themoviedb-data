With its bestiary of hundreds of paintings and engravings - horses, bison, jellyfish, penguins - the only underwater decorated cave in the world allows us to learn a little more about Mediterranean societies 30,000 years ago. Today, threatened by rising water levels accelerated by global warming, this jewel of the Upper Paleolithic is in danger of being swallowed up. To save the cave from disappearing, the Ministry of Culture has chosen to digitize it. From this virtual duplicate, a replica has been made on the surface to offer the public a reconstruction that allows them to admire these masterpieces.","popularity":0.6742,"poster_path":"/8EDwyXw6qzvGsXWCJ4AyjujDjRj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10323,"logo_path":"/uMlnpzZGM0rWxp69JU5cuAQEJbB.png","name":"Gedeon
