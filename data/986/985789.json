It was winner takes all. After seven years of turmoil, even the dramatic execution of King Charles I could not bring peace, more bloodshed still lay ahead. The most tragic and dramatic chapter in English history is recorded in this spectacular and entertaining DVD. It features superb battle re-enactments and reconstructions, dramatised 'eye-witness' accounts and delightful period personalities and the battles of the war.\r The programme also includes 3D computer graphics and expert analysis from leading historians to tell the story of the English Civil Wars.","popularity":0.4738,"poster_path":"/p7kyR5t66DXZqcNYs4xbv6p62Pr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
