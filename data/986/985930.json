However, he was conscious for some reason and could not hide his confusion and surprise. His body doesn't move and he has no senses, but only his ears can be heard. The voice of his son and his wife, who lived together, made him wonder if he was going to night and died in a pitiful way.  Even though it was a night out, his liquor-loving boy had removed his squirrel. Her son's daughter-in-law, Maya, came to Minoru, who couldn't yell at him and was amazed. She thought she was a well-made bride and wasted on her son. It also has a sexual meaning. Eventually, I heard the voice of an unknown man, different from her son. Maya called the man \"Mr. Matsuda\" and began to roar beside his body, uttering a hailless voice. Minoru's desire to see opened her one eye a little. But by that time things were done.","popularity":1.656,"poster_path":"/i3G4eEQN9e1eGP2BxUZgWerBNn1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Forest Film","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":138285,"logo_path":"/fjxX3f0XFIZYwUlpJkd4IAuNrWJ.png","name":"Okura Pictures","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Furin, hentai, monmon chōmon","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3582444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoka Takase","original_name":"Tomoka Takase","popularity":0.1872,"profile_path":"/6Up1y0HEqBrK9sMzO0teAMDskuN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maya Iizuka","credit_id":"62a217ea53866e4f7f9e97ad","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3109499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riona Suzushiro","original_name":"Riona Suzushiro","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/j5SxM9fgXw7wEHBEe0ELTbcTuGL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Seiya Iizuka","credit_id":"62a21817dc1cb42f11efb148","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2304406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rina Ayana","original_name":"彩奈リナ","popularity":2.542,"profile_path":"/uBrdIBEOsHmf0NKkybcNz3iH9LO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mitsuko Hinoki","credit_id":"62a2182035d1bc372c7594e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manzo Shinra","original_name":"森羅万象","popularity":0.4485,"profile_path":"/iVvIDIRj4L6M2DgASiAOPbCdby.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Minoru Iizuka","credit_id":"62a2182805b549009debf355","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2673142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kei-chan","original_name":"ケイチャン","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Isamu Matsuda","credit_id":"62a21833d2147c117e6c0e50","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takahiko Kobayashi","original_name":"Takahiko Kobayashi","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Akira Mogami","credit_id":"62a21841dc1cb42f0ee92f36","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2290101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takuya Sakurai","original_name":"櫻井拓也","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Kensuke Takagi","credit_id":"62a2184b05b549005035c39c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081040,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kosuke Komatsu","original_name":"小松公典","popularity":0.1955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a217b0e22d2800a884b3f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetsuya Takehora","original_name":"竹洞哲也","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a217a7528b2e00662af004","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11482168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cVwW7sjwJNWwBc2WnxdYQBCHMIo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i3G4eEQN9e1eGP2BxUZgWerBNn1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":907}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155477,"name":"softcore"},{"id":159551,"name":"pink film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
