Across the town, his opponent - Lord Wilbert Digby, a bully and a masterful pistol slinger already awaits. Henry travels to a remote field outside the town, which odds on seems to be his final destination. However, there is a hope.  Henry is accompanied by his second and a close friend of his late father. Lord Alistair Wallace, a drunkard war veteran, has his own agenda in this affair. He has made a strong promise to his late friend 10 years ago. When Henri Pinkerton and Lord Alistair Wallace meet Lord Wilbert Digby and his second Grenville Shelby, the conflict is such that there is no room for peace-making. Only a pistol duel can resolve matters.","popularity":0.1203,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rec'n'Roll","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Wallace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1564558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Dewdney","original_name":"Paul Dewdney","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/s4ObcotAjlaTcusS84SkbZhv8DL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lord Alastair Wallace","credit_id":"629f65fda8b2ca00a71772c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2989857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Clynes","original_name":"Chris Clynes","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/t2vaOa2aa9EdM7HXttTuAjRHpiO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Henri Pinkerton","credit_id":"629f660c85005d00675a28cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3579706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Unwin","original_name":"Richard Unwin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grenville Shelby","credit_id":"629f661ce19de900665a9566","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cem Kalfa","original_name":"Cem Kalfa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Master Alastair Wallace","credit_id":"629f662cd2147c117da3fb70","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3579707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nuno Cabaço","original_name":"Nuno Cabaço","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629f663f5507e973af6c9495","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3579708,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juris Tomsons","original_name":"Juris Tomsons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629f664b7e12f050e5c97c43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8680656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15126,"name":"historical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
