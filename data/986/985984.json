But when government agents shot his and thousands of other Inuit huskies across the Canadian Arctic, 11-year-old Harry saw the sky turn red and thought his dream forever destroyed. Now, fifty years later, Harry Okpik reflects on the tragedy of the Dog Slaughter and the accident that led to the loss of his leg. Follow Harry through the arctic seasons as he cares for his huskies and prepares for Ivakkak - a 600 km dog sled race across the Canadian Arctic. It is a race with the greater purpose: to bring back the nearly eradicated Inuit husky and a lost way of life.","popularity":0.1015,"poster_path":"/8Q3BPNtvzfbGt8j2c41Hcc5MkId.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101879,"logo_path":"/94MPF5yWga345hU1OdbexkINjMQ.png","name":"Catbird
