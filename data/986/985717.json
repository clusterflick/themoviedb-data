It was to be a confused and bitter business, marked by the foolishness of Prince Rupert and the Royalist cavalry, who left the field at a crucial stage of the battle. As darkness fell nearly 3000 men lay dead and the die was cast: the English Civil War would be no short and decisive affair. Featuring exciting and authentic battle reconstructions, plus footage of the battlefield as it is today, \"The Battle of Edgehill\" is a fascinating and powerful account of the encounter which set the brutal tone of the entire English Civil War.\r This authoritative programme also features period imagery and expert battle analysis.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/c7qeujcCNeroNn8VLuBhYk8oHPk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle of Edgehill","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"62a166cf7b7b4d00534aa1af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"62a1673a85005d0052c0cea8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438959,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Gormlie","original_name":"Chris Gormlie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a1671c1e922521e4db0c50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2569292,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Farrer","original_name":"Paul Farrer","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a166fe85005d0052c0cce8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"62a1674ec2bcc60050dadef5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Russell","original_name":"Gary Russell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a167667b7b4d00693e5b0a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":937,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AcVp3LkgMK5pFqgTohWtJa8TT0s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1666}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1121,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c7qeujcCNeroNn8VLuBhYk8oHPk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":747},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A7tbWmLPtVUodneAn4F0dLbk0eS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":796}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
