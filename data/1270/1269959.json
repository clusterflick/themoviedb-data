He doesn't speak English, but he's good at math, so he hopes to do well on his first math test in the USA.  Using untrained child actors from public schools in the San Francisco Bay Area, “Immersion” plunges its audience into the visceral experience of a child who cannot understand his teacher. The film puts a human face on the debate about the education of English Language Learners.","popularity":0.3521,"poster_path":"/kKckKP74JzgFUOaj0rnj1Avdeys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What would school be like if nobody spoke your language?","title":"Immersion (short)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Carlos De Silin","original_name":"Angela Carlos De Silin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6610031bf2883801650f1b28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nabor Acevedo","original_name":"Nabor Acevedo","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6610033df2cf250162d65444","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1458717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Theodora Dunlap","original_name":"Theodora Dunlap","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/mzMou7epgbsQEiesnDw5CrsqU0f.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ms. Peterson","credit_id":"6610036ad861af0164f39d0a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerardo Acevedo","original_name":"Gerardo Acevedo","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Gerardo","credit_id":"6610037674d6c0017cd9b477","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Acosta","original_name":"Antonio Acosta","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Janitor","credit_id":"66100397d48cee019fbddd1f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zareen Poonen Levien","original_name":"Zareen Poonen Levien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661002ac3e6f2b01643922ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711563,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Dilley","original_name":"John Dilley","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66100270078e4e017e96b2a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635745,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Frazer Bradshaw","original_name":"Frazer Bradshaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6610028df2cf250149d5ec72","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525265,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Levien","original_name":"Richard Levien","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/7xJC3T0TC6zTlibMFkTZGwDxhqp.jpg","credit_id":"661001f974d6c0017cd9b30d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1378693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kKckKP74JzgFUOaj0rnj1Avdeys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2356,"name":"immigrant"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":163127,"name":"mexican"},{"id":281057,"name":"spanish"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
