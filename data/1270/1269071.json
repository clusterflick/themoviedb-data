The attacker appears deranged, bathed in anger and tears. The reason that leads the two, apparently old acquaintances, to this state is not immediately revealed.

Here begins a puzzle to be put together, where present, past and illusion mix and become confused.","popularity":0.0795,"poster_path":"/3yvZn91vbG7RWV2wh9pDZP1l5hc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32606,"logo_path":"/mzMiVv4SNmqgiFqxekIPueW4YKf.png","name":"REC Produtores Associados","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":225214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zéfiro Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duas Mulheres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1052176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilda Nomacce","original_name":"Gilda Nomacce","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/21D3MifllOSVqm8BIb8hmh9JOOn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"660ddb089c97bd0163a4eb06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malu Bierrenbach","original_name":"Malu Bierrenbach","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/zoOXkKTQdTuyXFW8EOu8kydpd8w.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"660ddb0ee18e3f017da31a26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1299274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriã Possani","original_name":"Miriã Possani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"660ddb1533a376017d82c1d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anaterra Veloso","original_name":"Anaterra Veloso","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"660ddb1e5aadc4017c66b065","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2550078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Brennand","original_name":"Marcelo Brennand","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/ozBLUNOZX78eQGJQq4r2ze25Gwb.jpg","credit_id":"660dda545aadc4016364ac2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632714,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronaldo Correia de Brito","original_name":"Ronaldo Correia de Brito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ddaf3149565017dbca2e7","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585125,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Carolina Francisco","original_name":"Anna Carolina Francisco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ddafea88587017ce8b68c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yvZn91vbG7RWV2wh9pDZP1l5hc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"NFMLA New Filmmakers Los Angeles","release_date":"2016-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
