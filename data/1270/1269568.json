For much of the war, he maintained a public front of indifference and remained silent while German atrocities were committed. He refused pleas for help on the grounds of neutrality while making statements condemning injustices in general. Privately, he sheltered a small number of Jews and spoke to a few select officials, encouraging them to help the Jews.” This is a highly interesting documentary on this controversy.","popularity":0.1256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pius XII: The Pope, the Jews and the Nazis","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Lewis","original_name":"Jonathan Lewis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f6642f28838017e0efc65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0939655","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
