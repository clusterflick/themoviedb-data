A Bomb Squad detective, a fireman, an engineer for building 7, and an electrician give us a rare glimpse into the character of blue collar New Yorkers, faced with life and death situations. They reflect on how their sense of community, from growing up in an 'old school' neighborhood, influenced them and how they continue dealing with the legacy of that historic day. It's an intimate portrait of friendship and resiliency as told to their buddy, in a uniquely Bronx way.","popularity":0.2059,"poster_path":"/zudmOoBidxhZ84cOTXk53pzpHVp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boys from Kingsbridge - from Grammar School to Ground Zero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632374,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Daytron","original_name":"Charles Daytron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660dad0835818f017c3c6ef5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Darryl Hardin","original_name":"Darryl Hardin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660dacdcd400f3017d0680b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Darryl Hardin","original_name":"Darryl Hardin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660dacc2e18e3f017da30663","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom MacNamara","original_name":"Thom MacNamara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660dac880b5fd6016237a8d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom MacNamara","original_name":"Thom MacNamara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660daca06dc507017e56ac75","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Darryl Hardin","original_name":"Darryl Hardin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660daccd35818f013038b754","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom MacNamara","original_name":"Thom MacNamara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660dac9233a376014a8120f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom MacNamara","original_name":"Thom MacNamara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660daceee039f1017ce7c82f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2283952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8QZA4nja8KX7lLxfvnqhWLHbg1l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zudmOoBidxhZ84cOTXk53pzpHVp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bronx International Film Festival","release_date":"2013-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"KPBS San Diego","release_date":"2016-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Boys of Kingsbridge - from grammar school to ground zero (documentary trailer)","key":"XWCGQ37OT4I","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-07-21T05:20:31.000Z","id":"660dad6dc8a5ac0163794d7f"}]}}}
