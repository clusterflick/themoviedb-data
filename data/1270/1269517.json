Compiled as it is from German newsreels which were made under the influence of Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda, these are by no means accurate histories but allow unique insight into how the period leading up to and including WW2 was presented to the German people.  Volume 7 deals with the third part of the year 1941. It covers events on all the German fronts including: Western Front - destroyers and torpedo boats escort German convoys in the English Channel; African Front - Rommel decorates his soldiers; Eastern Front - the battle for Roslaw; Home Front - Hitler & Mussolini inspect the front line troops, Belgian & Danish  volunteers are sworn in at Hamburg.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Newsreel History of the Third Reich: Vol. 7","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
