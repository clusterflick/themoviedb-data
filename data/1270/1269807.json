Connected by flowing water, in seas, rivers, and lakes. Accompanied by Tim Sharp's voice, which continually falls into rhyme. In the same way that the images rhyme, letting the water return image after image. But also the dead of history and the ecological destruction of the present. The cinematic image itself becomes water and a mirror of a world on the brink of catastrophe, ready to melt away. A fluid film with fierce irony.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2024-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Sharp","original_name":"Tim Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9dd6f2cf25017cd6886c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Sharp","original_name":"Tim Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9dde4a4bf6017c288904","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Sharp","original_name":"Tim Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9de474d6c00163d8d92a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Sharp","original_name":"Tim Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9dec4a4bf6017c288917","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Sharp","original_name":"Tim Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9df4e78e2d017d227e0c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Sharp","original_name":"Tim Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9dff2d531a01317d7b39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Diagonale 2024","release_date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
