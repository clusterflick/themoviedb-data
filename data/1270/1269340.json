The directorâ€™s grandmother, now aged, shares her memories about life as a woman, the hopefulness of the 1960s, and the changing landscape of a town in the south of Italy troubled by a polluting steel mill. As the past is fading, remembering becomes seeing for the first time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5cUk3cbo6pNk2R7HxIwsCKvXhcu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lady with Lipstick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5cUk3cbo6pNk2R7HxIwsCKvXhcu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
