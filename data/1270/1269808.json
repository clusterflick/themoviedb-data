The one is Rosa Luxemburg, interned as a political prisoner in Breslau, the other Rosa Liebknecht.

An enchantingly beautiful film.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2024-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Should One Do. - In Delight?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merlinda Tahiri","original_name":"Merlinda Tahiri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"660f9f1774d6c0017cd945ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Hermsdorf","original_name":"Julia Hermsdorf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"660f9f1c4a4bf6013027b69b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astrid Ofner","original_name":"Astrid Ofner","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9e79d38b580163b9b411","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658937,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Rabeder","original_name":"David Rabeder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9ea22d531a01647dea72","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658937,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Rabeder","original_name":"David Rabeder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9e84078e4e017e9655a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658938,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Simon Rabeder","original_name":"Simon Rabeder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9e99d48cee019fbd96ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Pujadas Bosch","original_name":"David Pujadas Bosch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9e8cd48cee019fbd969c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astrid Ofner","original_name":"Astrid Ofner","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f9e74d48cee0186bd3bd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Diagonale 2024","release_date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDMarseille","release_date":"2024-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
