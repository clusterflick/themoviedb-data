E. Busenello, and the fine voices of contralto Maria Ewing, baritone Dennis Bailey, and several other sub-leads is not to be missed and will be fully enjoyed. No lead tenor here and none needed. No soprano here as a lead and none needed. One of the joys of my watching and listening outside the opera hall. The story line is strong and the tale well carried out.","popularity":0.2405,"poster_path":"/hr5emvuyQn5RqNY5Wa0OgLhXjTO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12638,"logo_path":null,"name":"NVC Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A fine production with several wonderful singers","title":"Monteverdi - L'Incoronazione Di Poppea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1299309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Ewing","original_name":"Maria Ewing","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":"/vSWBBRRh04UzocS22TZvVnFvhfm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Poppea","credit_id":"660e5a8115dea0016234ca86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4633492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Bailey","original_name":"Dennis Bailey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nero","credit_id":"660e5ab9e039f1017ce88f53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Clarey","original_name":"Cynthia Clarey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cU0Z2E1VXnhkS8d6SIk0rsZwOoI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Octavia","credit_id":"660e5ae9e039f1017ce88f8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lloyd","original_name":"Robert Lloyd","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/39hqwFKidqj2K97pEmRMSjwzrzf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Seneca","credit_id":"660e5b039dee58017d09f947","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Gale","original_name":"Elizabeth Gale","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Drusilla","credit_id":"660e5b316dc507016456518f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Duesing","original_name":"Dale Duesing","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/zM4E5HDkbplKe3XduKcKObKpcS2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ottone","credit_id":"660e5b50a88587017ce970be","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":60983,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raymond Leppard","original_name":"Raymond Leppard","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"660e5b70da9ef20164573ba9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95914,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claudio Monteverdi","original_name":"Claudio Monteverdi","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/jOCDfg8XQABcdgQUXe62yrnKT2y.jpg","credit_id":"660e5c1133a376017d839f15","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hall","original_name":"Peter Hall","popularity":0.3336,"profile_path":"/c6g5T2lQ3eopgwz3ofrWTbPa7EI.jpg","credit_id":"660e5ba533a376017d839e63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337016,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"John Bury","original_name":"John Bury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660e5bfc15dea0017c374742","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oIOk0jdNJkOjBXGz3WY0bqqlnc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hr5emvuyQn5RqNY5Wa0OgLhXjTO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
