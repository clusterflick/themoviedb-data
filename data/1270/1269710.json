The film intricately documents the creation of a portrait of the politician and benefactor Evangelos Averoff by the painter Yorgos Rorris. Rorris guides us through the meticulous process he is about to embark on. His working method is unique, as the subject of the portrait has passed away (Evangelos Averoff: 1910 – 1990). The studio, serving as the documentary's primary setting, is creatively enhanced with sounds, descriptions, memories, and images from the life and acquaintances of Evangelos Averoff.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/dtTXQnWdgF7ABgrfNiTSZT2dM1b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The portrait: Yorgos Rorris paints Evaggelos Averoff","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalliopi Alexiadou","original_name":"Kalliopi Alexiadou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f51a1fd6300017d1a3c53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonis Simeonidis","original_name":"Antonis Simeonidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f51953e6f2b014a3896c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1041,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dtTXQnWdgF7ABgrfNiTSZT2dM1b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":694}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
