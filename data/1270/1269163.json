A place of refuge, of collective and feminist transformation. From this edge, alongside those who build it, the filmmaker questions their place in nature and society, as well as the freedom of their body and the prospect of having a child. Openly alluding to Virginia Woolf’s famous quote (“A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\") and introducing us to a bouquet of incredible, uncompromised female characters, an investigative yet tender camera challenges the boundaries of gendered social roles and immerses in the micro-universe of absolute freedom and self-determination.","popularity":0.0638,"poster_path":"/nkLhKzIup7D9f4ogRT97lY8kPr6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Shelter of One’s Own","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Tourrent","original_name":"Eva Tourrent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660e149995ce24017d6fac62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1409,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkLhKzIup7D9f4ogRT97lY8kPr6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
