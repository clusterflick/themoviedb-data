It covers events on all the German fronts including: War Against the Soviet Union - Finland and Germany face the Soviet threat; Finnish Front - the battles for Kovno in Lithuania; Eastern Front - the heavy artillery and aerial attack on Brest; Ukraine Front - the battle for Kiev; Home Front - occupied countries join German forces against the Soviets.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Newsreel History of the Third Reich: Vol. 6","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
