Shortly after his birth, there was a coup d’état; before he even turned 10, the king abdicated and Spain became a Republic; as he was entering adolescence, the police imprisoned his father for politically supporting an independent Catalan republic, and two years later, a terrible civil war broke out. During his childhood, Biel is barely aware of what is happening. He is a gifted child who learns to read and write at home. However, the radicalization of the political and social clashes taking place around him turns Biel into a witness of horror. The story of a teenage boy through the most violent years in the history of Spain, years that will lead to the disenchantment with which Gabriel Ferrater and other members of his generation perceive the human condition.","popularity":0.1444,"poster_path":"/x9Y3Edfm0MnzBMrbkDzXkbrlECg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121971,"logo_path":"/xt8EhNCEJBsV62cJytEZaUEmSDO.png","name":"Un Capricho de Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Memoriam Biel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pere Arquillué","original_name":"Pere Arquillué","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":"/l9P3IcJJfcdQueLoSFi1rdz1m4d.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"672dc85bd98bbc3977ad4a5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3038537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biel Castaño","original_name":"Biel Castaño","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pCd7Kfv062gVRpK0mdAX6gF08nZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"672dc85fd98bbc3977ad4a60","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mariona Guiu Pont","original_name":"Mariona Guiu Pont","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ee3e99c97bd017ca8a74f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Santi Suárez-Baldrís","original_name":"Santi Suárez-Baldrís","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ee39733a376013180fe04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Santi Suárez-Baldrís","original_name":"Santi Suárez-Baldrís","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672dc875599da28980959052","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Belén Sánchez","original_name":"Belén Sánchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672dc880f2880d1004f6b327","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Belén Sánchez","original_name":"Belén Sánchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672dc88e599da2898095905c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5046884,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Queralt Pons","original_name":"Queralt Pons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672dc89bf2880d1004f6b342","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Santi Suárez-Baldrís","original_name":"Santi Suárez-Baldrís","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672dc8a1ebe21def08c8effb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariadna Relea","original_name":"Ariadna Relea","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672dc8aafc658fd33c2a0aff","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31579785","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1512,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x9Y3Edfm0MnzBMrbkDzXkbrlECg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/linCB74gx994jrndQbuWtTSGed9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/kSR9OMDAaytiBQMRKzf8bEMF5t1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
