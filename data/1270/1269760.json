In three brief sections, the film details the exterior windows and turrets, then, in stark contrast from within the darkened interior, demonstrates the play of light through the stained glass windows. In the final segment, the camera returns to the building’s exterior, but now its sightline is impaired by a chain link fence, possibly in an allusion to the structure’s origin as a courthouse and prison for women. The final shots focus on the plaque affixed to the exterior, which states, “…constructed in 1876 and served as a women’s court until 1932. Of particular interest are its turrets, tracery windows, ironwork and sculpture.”","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jefferson Market","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Storm De Hirsch","original_name":"Storm De Hirsch","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/a0urzWTKgajln3sRo11nJ7u5KAL.jpg","credit_id":"660f74ba3f8ede017ce32274","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
