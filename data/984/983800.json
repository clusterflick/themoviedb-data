In recent decades the New Norcia Monastery has been packaged as one of the State's leading cultural tourist attractions. \"A unique blend of Spanish architecture, European art treasures and pioneer history,\" \"Monks, Music & Mystery,\" \"New Norcia, Australia's only monastic town,\" the brochures announce. Aboriginal testimony in the film challenges this revised and sanitised history. The documentary provides damming evidence of the continuing violence of the Mission against its victims by deliberate omission of their experience in the New Norcia museum, guided tours, art gallery and promotions â€” an omission that represents a cruel and wounding cover-up.","popularity":0.0582,"poster_path":"/nPANbS4zz0vbsMpwrUyQOuepbub.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Habits Of New Norcia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Rijavec","original_name":"Frank Rijavec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629b5b3409ed8f4aa3d36b73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPANbS4zz0vbsMpwrUyQOuepbub.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
