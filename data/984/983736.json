Detective Tono and his team, who are renowned for their interrogation skills, realise from evidence left at the scene that there are still survivors who have fled the scene. After obtaining information about the customers from the owner-chef, who was slightly injured, Tono visits the suspects, but they all seem to be acting strangely and are hiding something. The hidden relationship between the suspects, who seemed unrelated, is then revealed.","popularity":0.5464,"poster_path":"/eWR37b9tCn6UxMpkqVJoUDdSElw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9300,"logo_path":"/9sSD1XufVCJWAadNiC9Mwu994VD.png","name":"TV Asahi","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Supper Detective Tono Kazuyuki and the Seven Suspects","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤浩市","popularity":1.0025,"profile_path":"/pxrNrFs3GUmCosKHXsuDX2MmSvX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"629b21071e9225006427f2ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tasuku Emoto","original_name":"柄本佑","popularity":0.8209,"profile_path":"/bWFDE4bXUQxmyUey6sA5S84A3vG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"629b21155507e912c7932104","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rokkaku Seiji","original_name":"六角精児","popularity":0.3504,"profile_path":"/kvPFV8sF9HdwBu7710jZFDAuF0C.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"629b211fd71fb474e0df7c20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanata Hongo","original_name":"本郷奏多","popularity":0.7484,"profile_path":"/5BUmrqD3nbER1XV3ASSwFZitwwv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"629b21295507e912c569cc8b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitomi Kuroki","original_name":"黒木瞳","popularity":1.6246,"profile_path":"/4rGUnsCPTkgWTOq6CWfkD3BT1sl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"629b21337ad08c4e68662439","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arata Iura","original_name":"井浦新","popularity":0.8263,"profile_path":"/uJbyT6FDqDfVZKXpkDvRDS7NcQj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"安西雄哉","credit_id":"629b213edc1cb40e470bf9ef","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sosuke Ikematsu","original_name":"池松壮亮","popularity":0.7639,"profile_path":"/mNhgUAKfHdKQXhbhbAhKcRUHy30.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"629b21497ad08c4e670c6e7c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1029252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Airi Matsuyama","original_name":"松山愛里","popularity":0.2787,"profile_path":"/mB8fWhLW0JXDd8M83mKNZFbEaTu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66985debbfd27e6fb7298a8b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2202638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun Akiyama","original_name":"秋山純","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/nE01Np3dMOPwefYYg9aerD6fmCR.jpg","credit_id":"62a41179d55697009c602a13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2041238,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takahito Eguchi","original_name":"Takahito Eguchi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a411d6d2147c12f5938b53","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":580603,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yumiko Inoue","original_name":"井上由美子","popularity":0.2751,"profile_path":"/tieTTwszDDw9cz1oKPPYCw7zcN0.jpg","credit_id":"62a411a1d2147c12f6590ea8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWR37b9tCn6UxMpkqVJoUDdSElw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
