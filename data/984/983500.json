In the installation, appropriated broadcast television images — electronically processed and decontextualized by Jones — were rendered as abstract, black- and-white visuals. The visual sources were, as Jones states, \"images of Third World People and the images of victimization, deprivation, weakness and the connotation that Third World People are unable to take care of themselves.\" The soundtrack consisted of sounds gathered from short-wave broadcasts: howls, whistles, high-speed telemetry signals, coded voices, growls, screams. This piece, states Jones, represents \"my bad dream and Third World people's collective bad dream.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dr3erWXD1VnuL66VxTyJXEPaMCX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghosts & Demons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208073,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philip Mallory Jones","original_name":"Philip Mallory Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629a5868dc1cb4005048b0e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dr3erWXD1VnuL66VxTyJXEPaMCX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
