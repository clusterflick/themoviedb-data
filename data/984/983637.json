This musical chameleon always makes a statement on his albums by combining influences such as punk, jazz, swing, pop, rock and New Wave with his wry, surreal and wickedly humorous lyrics. Jackson’s eclectic live concert will feature band members Graham Maby (Bass, Vocals), Teddy Kumpel (Guitar, Vocals) and Doug Yowell (Drums, Vocals, Electronics).","popularity":0.1992,"poster_path":"/tuzMYrRH1VHHEz1B0hsuybWTjNG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Jackson: Sing, You Sinners! - Live at The Beacon Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42462,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joe Jackson","original_name":"Joe Jackson","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/mIidkkh1jceI5zdoWFQYDp7uH2F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"629ab90709ed8f4aa4a3ab0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Maby","original_name":"Graham Maby","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"629ab90fa44d095275eef2fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3575132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Kumpel","original_name":"Teddy Kumpel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"629ab933dc1cb40066118132","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3575133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Yowell","original_name":"Doug Yowell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"629ab94e09ed8f4aa4a3ace4","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tuzMYrRH1VHHEz1B0hsuybWTjNG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
