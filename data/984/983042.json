Rather than train the animals, he persuades them. To do this he uses his own unusual methods. He uses love, understanding, and trust, and has developed some very close bonds with these animals. He has become many things, a trusted ally, the dominant male of a clan of hyenas, a brother. But most of all he is well-loved and trusted by his animal friends. He sleeps with lions, cuddles new-born hyenas and swims with lionesses.","popularity":0.145,"poster_path":"/xNeXUx5QuPaPCKQkFsukkEaEDZq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Forging a unique bond between man and beast.","title":"Dangerous Companions","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1446178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Richardson","original_name":"Kevin Richardson","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":"/pbvWRGJ0XiyLx0cGfnGK0F8Q8wy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6298dea65507e914938a32ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Boraine","original_name":"Nick Boraine","popularity":0.284,"profile_path":"/lcuyeUFhnYVp2YdUscYNFOQxkJ3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6298deb865e0a20066bf6776","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefania Lamberti","original_name":"Stefania Lamberti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6429085ac0442901f0027374","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2462542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xNeXUx5QuPaPCKQkFsukkEaEDZq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
