Eng Äerd presents long-term initiatives of Luxembourg citizens fighting against the depletion of natural resources. Different initiatives already in existence are presented by those who drive and supervise them. The film wants to encourage viewers to change their thinking, both in their private lives and at the level of associations, as well as from an economic and political point of view. It explores the motivations of these Luxembourgish environmentalists and shows that everyone can contribute to building a new healthier and more solidary society in harmony with nature and for the good of all.","popularity":0.1506,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film about environmental awareness and waste of resources in Luxembourg.","title":"Eng Äerd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286178,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom Alesch","original_name":"Tom Alesch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62993d3da44d095274ca2755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692409,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Viviane Thill","original_name":"Viviane Thill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62993ddd8fdda9006769dfed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikos Welter","original_name":"Nikos Welter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62993df1d71fb416c904d837","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3573556,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Doreen Teyka","original_name":"Doreen Teyka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62993e1d99259c0051d8042f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71592,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pia Dumont","original_name":"Pia Dumont","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62993e351e9225004f83f795","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emre Sevindik","original_name":"Emre Sevindik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62993e4734e152006653968a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13545856","wikidata_id":"Q88062527","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Eng Äerd","key":"395905697","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-06T09:01:29.000Z","id":"62993e8cd71fb416c904da85"}]}}}
