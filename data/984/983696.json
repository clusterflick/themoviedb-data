He's on every social media platform, his days are timed out to the minute by his \"people\"â€¦ he's in the cog so to speak. Krystal is an artist and scientist who lives completely off the grid. She keeps track of the declining weather progression with her own system, has a survival \"go\" bag, and enjoys quiet and solitude.  The two meet by chance one day when Matthew decides to step out of his routine and Krystal is out foraging. The next few months are spent in a cocoon of love with minimal outside distractions proving two people from very different worlds actually have a lot more in common.  They almost forget that the world as we know it is ending soon and will \"restart\". The pair then have to make a life changing decision.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bIQMlhJNPutd1i74YvLEu36PxY3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Archie & The Storyteller","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bIQMlhJNPutd1i74YvLEu36PxY3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
