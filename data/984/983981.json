While their bond has grown increasingly stale since first moving in together, theyâ€™re tethered by a common history and lingering grief; they know the house and its traumas in ways none of its few rotating tenants ever can.  Set in the politically charged recent past at Hampshire College - an alternative school without grades or majors - the film's protagonists struggle with the demands of communal living and the concentrated emotions that come with it, against a backdrop of mass protests, long winters, creative passions, and armchair philosophy.","popularity":0.2837,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snowflakes","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3576316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayo
