Raw visuals drawn from the artistâ€™s garden over a period of two years bathe everything and everyone and confront us with silence. Vibrant leaf-prints, fingerprints, scratches and tape marks on celluloid work with the various phytographic offspring to evoke human entanglements with nature. With every touch of the hand or lamplight, these botanical image-traces are simultaneously illuminated and deteriorated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6CWBCENRyUUdpesgrtCgdQBPs7z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Compendium","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2317702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisca Duran","original_name":"Francisca Duran","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c8d074aad9c20164b6e7de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6CWBCENRyUUdpesgrtCgdQBPs7z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
