Having given up photography in later life and virtually disowned her own work, Miller's extraordinary archive of 40,000 negatives was only rediscovered after her death. George Melly, David Hare, friends, colleagues and her only son, Tony Penrose, trace the story of her unconventional life through her own remarkable pictures and photographs, as well as rarely seen archive footage.","popularity":0.5027,"poster_path":"/9agOXENgJ3And5e4sknTEKu6SGp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lee Miller: A Crazy Way of Seeing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsty Wark","original_name":"Kirsty Wark","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/rt3p6XAltoX1JHxtZXVkqi8rnhQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65c86b553c3ab0012fce6323","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jana Sheldon","original_name":"Jana Sheldon","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Voice of Lee Miller (voice)","credit_id":"65c86b6de4b576017d15d230","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Melly","original_name":"George Melly","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/5LY5BKeZQRDlCkTDQvkwvtKDO1F.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c86ba5b6cff10185a68d90","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8403,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Hare","original_name":"David Hare","popularity":0.4706,"profile_path":"/fbS6ii117N26KBRceAQo9zTBmNW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c86bb04350110183e9578d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antony Penrose","original_name":"Antony Penrose","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c86bc2680be80149a36a00","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Miller","original_name":"Lee Miller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"65c8fb63e295b40162f8ae38","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2173024,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Numeroff","original_name":"Richard Numeroff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c86bdd98f1f10183d87a96","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":138457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Lockyer","original_name":"Andrew Lockyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c86a9c98f1f10183d87901","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31733,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Quigley","original_name":"Andrew Quigley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c86bec54a098018402d651","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Aspinall","original_name":"Sarah Aspinall","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c86c23aaec71019b594685","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986180,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"May Miller","original_name":"May Miller","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c86c0d26677801495739a8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Aspinall","original_name":"Sarah Aspinall","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c86a8f266778017c58ea41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9agOXENgJ3And5e4sknTEKu6SGp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1003,"name":"photographer"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC2","release_date":"2001-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
