How much would a woman sacrifice for love? Nine, daughter of a triad boss, travels to Beijing in a bid to win back her boyfriend, Chung, refuting the suspicion that he’s absconded with the gang’s money. With the camera trained on her wide-eyed face, Nine leads Chung on a whirlwind adventure through the capital’s sinister underbelly where their paths cross with those of low-life thugs, each having a role to play in a clever ruse to ferret out a snitch. With 10 million dollars at stake, emotions are running high and tension is taut and each puff of smoke is harrowing.","popularity":0.0698,"poster_path":"/1288WZtiTbOqgypcI2O9mpkXuk5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2012-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Night in the Capital City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Hon-Fan Kwok","original_name":"Jeff Hon-Fan Kwok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c91d9ce295b40148f8370b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2619082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1288WZtiTbOqgypcI2O9mpkXuk5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"III","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"7th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2012-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
