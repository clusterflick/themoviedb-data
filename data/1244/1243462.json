In modern times, Harry Thorn loves Grace Dupont, but after losing his money he drifts toward crime. He steals a necklace, and when Grace finds out she cancels their engagement. Harry decides to give himself up, thereby finally establishing some strength of character. When he gets out of jail, Grace takes him back, but Harry has to face one more temptation.
