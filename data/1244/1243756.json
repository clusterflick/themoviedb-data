His debut documentary was created out of agony as a timely, impactful, and tragic response to the collective anguish of all who call Gaza home...  What began as an auto-generated slideshow on Monear’s iPhone of his own trip to see his family in 2021, has since transformed into a feature-length documentary.  Through a tapestry of intimate interviews, unfiltered personal footage, and raw storytelling, \"Gaza Is Our Home\" transcends the political rhetoric and confronts audiences with the agonizing reality and ongoing cruelty thrust upon the film-makers own family.  It is more than just a documentary...  Rather, \"Gaza Is Our Home\" stands as a testament to the humanity behind the over 33,362 innocent lives massacred since Oct 2023...","popularity":0.2777,"poster_path":"/l0kB3n762YsgTa0oXF1SBVohthd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What began as a simple family slideshow...has become a message for humanity.","title":"Gaza Is Our Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4531094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monear Shaer","original_name":"Monear Shaer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6601b36660620a017c2e2539","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4864066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nabeha Shaer","original_name":"Nabeha Shaer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66adc08985118ad36850c826","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4531094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monear Shaer","original_name":"Monear Shaer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c93b248d77c4017b46fe57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/34C1L0eLajV6KtJnehYowPQ0sdF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l0kB3n762YsgTa0oXF1SBVohthd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":163118,"name":"social justice"},{"id":275377,"name":"gaza"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
