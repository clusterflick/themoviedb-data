He reflects on his challenging childhood, being raised by aunts who didn't like him much and feeling the burden of humiliation. Comedy became an escape from his hardships. He transitioned from being a welder to a folk musician and comedian, spurred by a colleague's encouragement. Connolly talks about his inspiration for comedy, often deriving from small, everyday observations, and admits to struggling with retaining information. He shares his views on religion, having grown from a devout child to a skeptical adult. Connolly also touches on his fashion sense, his experience with fame, and its effects on his personal life, particularly his first marriage and children. He candidly discusses parenthood, encouraging new parents to embrace every aspect, including sharing their bed with their baby for safety and bonding.","popularity":0.5093,"poster_path":"/27pHHBhtSguQAJbkW1yBzE8V0ud.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tickety-boo","origin_country":""},{"id":40235,"logo_path":"/duPwb7Yi1zCVKiPAyN2QWpQFOpl.png","name":"Nine Network Australia","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening In Australia With Billy Connolly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Connolly","original_name":"Billy Connolly","popularity":1.645,"profile_path":"/imqsEA1EPet7OvHx80VfTYfFcWf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c8412ca93d2501844cb158","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1228507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wilkins","original_name":"Richard Wilkins","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c8417caad9c2017db7c1f4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4529725,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harley Medcalfe","original_name":"Harley Medcalfe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c841dde4b57601641498e6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4529731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Beness","original_name":"Greg Beness","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c842e198f1f10183d845e5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Rodgers","original_name":"Andrew Rodgers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c84222e4b5760164149908","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4529729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kemenyvary","original_name":"Mark Kemenyvary","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c84247ce6c4c017cba0652","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/27pHHBhtSguQAJbkW1yBzE8V0ud.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
