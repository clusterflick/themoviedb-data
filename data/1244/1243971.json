The film combines observational documentary and narrative filmmaking techniques with AI modelling systems, machine learning, computer generated imagery and post synchronised audio in order to suspend both the real and the imagined within the very same frames. The project is interested in the filming act as an extended topographical gesture, one which may be used to not only record space (and time within space) in real terms, but also as a way to order it such that one might arrive at poetic, fictional and speculative ends.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Space Between Islands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Magor","original_name":"Joshua Magor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ca08f6ce6c4c0149b9f07b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
