Though their large scale environmental projects, such as Running Fence and Wrapped Coast, are often met with distress and concern from the surrounding community, perceptions of the project are likely to shift when it comes time to interact with the grand, finished piece. Neither permanent nor purchasable, Christo and Jeanne-Claudeâ€™s works exude the essence of freedom and exist only for the sake of existing.","popularity":0.1566,"poster_path":"/gMCUMuUYNAypNLGOaLo3qM631R0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christo and Jeanne-Claude: A Environmental Art Duo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christo","original_name":"Christo","popularity":0.1022,"profile_path":"/l97vImuBfnjVIb9nHsHqNiJ9PTX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c77d222667780163576f23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne-Claude","original_name":"Jeanne-Claude","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c77d31680be80162a39530","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Biolek","original_name":"Alfred Biolek","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c77d49aad9c2017db6bd63","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"65c77d84a3144001658d2aad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1861296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gMCUMuUYNAypNLGOaLo3qM631R0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
