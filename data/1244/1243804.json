The bright studio lights make it easy for fellow guitarists to cop dozens of Gilbert's licks, as he turns up the heat in his orange NASA get up. Check out the blazing \"Down To Mexico\" from his \"Flying Dog\" CD for more up-tempo, six-string fun. Gilbert introduces each track with his own unique brand of humor and technical input.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Gilbert - Space Ship One","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
