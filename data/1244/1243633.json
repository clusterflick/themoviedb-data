Drawing on the memories of big names in Dunne’s field, including Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, Tina Brown, Joan Didion and octogenarian New York Post gossip columnist Liz Smith as well as legendary Hollywood producer Robert Evans (The Godfather, Chinatown), the film uncovers what lies beneath a life.  The film examines Dunne’s life from childhood, and his early days of being “an outsider on the inside”: a theme that has informed his whole life. From his World War II service that made Dunne return an unlikely hero – awarded the Bronze Star for bravery – to his rise and ultimate fall in Hollywood and then total reincarnation as a writer in his fifties, this film explores the nature of reinvention, belief in oneself, and the all-pervasive cult of celebrity.","popularity":0.7953,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebrity: Dominick Dunne — A Journalist in the Age of Celebrity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominick Dunne","original_name":"Dominick Dunne","popularity":0.2942,"profile_path":"/anKIYrCAfBmRE6fi7AKHgPuHouw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c8ecb498f1f10183d8e996","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68954,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Graydon Carter","original_name":"Graydon Carter","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/9V81UKhvgPHa9c6IAh8Z10CzUri.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c8eccf266778017c593ef5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joan Didion","original_name":"Joan Didion","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/mKTHMeZ4jWPDGjEDKIPIPbbfWsc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c8ecdc9451e701637b20d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Griffin Dunne","original_name":"Griffin Dunne","popularity":1.0649,"profile_path":"/3wg8VsC3K9D2iUyCa9fVWW35qcm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c8ece898f1f10162d7a475","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12288,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Evans","original_name":"Robert Evans","popularity":0.256,"profile_path":"/5OvhrPq1I4GaTlNrHFKnh3jfUP6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65c8ecf9e4b576017d163317","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daryl Dellora","original_name":"Daryl Dellora","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c8ec8fb6cff10185a6f028","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
