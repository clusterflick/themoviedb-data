As the Duke begins to seduce Rigoletto's daughter Gilda, the jester must realize that it is not within his power to protect her. What follows is an epic story of betrayal, revenge, and above all, love. Director Oliver Mears turns Verdi's masterpiece into a modern drama about morality, where in a decadent world full of corruption and depravity, power stands against innocence. Antonio Pappano conducts a stunning ensemble featuring a fascinating Carlos Álvarez in the title role, Lisette Oropesa as the incomparable Gilda, and tenor Liparit Avetisyan as the Duke of Mantua.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/a1c8RVHpD2IPG0hGUHiBcohzSE2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigoletto - ROH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Álvarez","original_name":"Carlos Álvarez","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/dJy0BIYUBe7IoTg8LHftLnewNA3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rigoletto","credit_id":"67d8802f31678cc3f801ca3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5302588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liparit Avetisyan","original_name":"Liparit Avetisyan","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Duke of Mantua","credit_id":"67d8803b814f677063f15bc1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramona Zaharia","original_name":"Ramona Zaharia","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maddalena","credit_id":"67d8805e25f01d54167c4e22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brindley Sherratt","original_name":"Brindley Sherratt","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tTie8tju3MepAbbiuaEIgpG6Kuu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sparafucile","credit_id":"67d88072814f677063f15c04","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisette Oropesa","original_name":"Lisette Oropesa","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/mS1b7eQbkxgKLEHsFikN8VeBleN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gilda","credit_id":"67df2b7b210fa80a0f4d838a","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1c8RVHpD2IPG0hGUHiBcohzSE2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":845}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
