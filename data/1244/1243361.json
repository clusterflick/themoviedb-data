The 10-day program includes biometric testing, physician supervision, and daily meals. As we go through the immersion, we hear from participants of their past struggles living with such a dreaded disease, and we hear of their hope for a better life. We watch firsthand as they suddenly change their diet from a standard American diet to a whole food plant-based diet, and we see how this leads to unexpected and astounding results.","popularity":0.4956,"poster_path":"/fDv5gwgxOYVsrk5E7toRwfKE9vF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220548,"logo_path":null,"name":"PlantPure Communities","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Imagine what would happen if you took six people suffering from type 2 diabetes and put them in a house together for 10 days, with only delicious food as their medicine.
