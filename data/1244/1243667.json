Unlike his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Charles always knew he would one day become King. Becoming heir apparent at just three years old, Charles has become the oldest and longest serving heir apparent in British history, as well as the longest serving Prince of Wales, having held the title since 1958. In his own way, he has defined the role of heir apparent. He has been called a visionary in his creative and forward thinking ideas, with his passions for the environment, for architecture and for alternative medicine. Charles is president or patron to over 400 charities and organisations, and known as one of the most hard-working royals, alongside his sister Anne, the Princess Royal. In his many years of service to his country, he has undoubtedly earned his place, and earned the respect and admiration of the people. Here, we look back at the life of Prince Charles, a king in the making.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prince Charles: The Making of A King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21803870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
