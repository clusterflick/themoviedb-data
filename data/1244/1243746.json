Sleeping rough on the streets for eight years and counting, he is by no means a do-gooder bent on saving the helpless but is simply eking out a meagre existence in a society that turns a blind eye to individuals like him and renders them invisible. One day, the sighting of one such misper turns into a debacle, and the man hunter finds himself the unlikely saviour of the runaway. Yet beggars can’t be choosers and survivors should never be apologetic for putting their own well-being first. Still, it begs the question: As a society we are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable. And what does that make us, having failed so miserably collectively?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2013-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beggar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sze","original_name":"Shi Bolin","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c93577266778017c597127","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"III","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"8th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2013-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
