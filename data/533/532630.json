After befriending Leni, a shy, neighborhood eleven year old, Jack's seemingly harmless relationship with the young girl starts to take on a much darker quality. As Jack struggles with irrepressible and depraved feelings for Leni, he is faced with a moral dilemma he knows he must confront. Unsuspecting of the magnitude of their relationship, Leni's older sister, Kayla, develops a crush on the mysterious and outwardly wholesome stranger befriending her sister. It isn't until Kayla comes to realize what Jack's motives truly are that Jack must face his secret and himself and make a decision that will forever change his life.","popularity":0.2531,"poster_path":"/nJVFvXCl37YYpRQV7ej0DEnUo96.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children at Play","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Dechart","original_name":"Bryan Dechart","popularity":0.8515,"profile_path":"/snfYiW0GDDMUtr2s1dgQkSUR7Y1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jack Wolf","credit_id":"5b35169c9251413c660255ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4875332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Lipinski","original_name":"Amanda Lipinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Kayla","credit_id":"66b594ee90426a8b55a75d78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4875334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caitlyn McDonald","original_name":"Caitlyn McDonald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Leni (as Caitlyn Anne)","credit_id":"66b5950088cb7e1a39124cad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4875337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cara Lee McDonald","original_name":"Cara Lee McDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Inmate's Daughter","credit_id":"66b595cea1b95b4c8f4554c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4875338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis M.","original_name":"Francis M.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Stranger","credit_id":"66b595db95eff952feae14b5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123916,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Lexan Rosser","original_name":"Lexan Rosser","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b593d695c79ef446e5cd38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123916,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Lexan Rosser","original_name":"Lexan Rosser","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b593dfcf10bee8a8c5ea2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4875327,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Jaffe","original_name":"Joseph Jaffe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b593f87eb903531e45535a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215268,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Neil Biagio","original_name":"Neil Biagio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b5940b0d3ecd24f1280405","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1729883,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Weidner","original_name":"James Weidner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b5946c40901d3fc825f944","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4531675,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Collin Kornfeind","original_name":"Collin Kornfeind","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b59480277f0dcef57ab52f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1729883,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Weidner","original_name":"James Weidner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b5948a587c70c3cad6cf03","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215268,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Neil Biagio","original_name":"Neil Biagio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b59499080ae8e490d6d2a7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375773,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christopher Cafaro","original_name":"Christopher Cafaro","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b594a8769e19b595c9e510","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4450751,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ibrahim Ouchikh","original_name":"Ibrahim Ouchikh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b594b52f3566aac67ab8c6","department":"Camera","job":"Key Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577764,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Matthew J.
