Or was he a greedy and devious charlatan who swindled theories from others? Was he the generator of the present sense of individuality or did he contaminate humanity’s moral values with selfcenteredness?  With debate from world-renowned Freud experts and philosophers, and animation, humour, art and music, More Alive than Dead explores the multifaceted Freudian influence on our culture and society.","popularity":0.1061,"poster_path":"/364RH3kaiIW8bh15TtPcXRS4c6k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Alive Than Dead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marek Rozenbaum","original_name":"Marek Rozenbaum","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3447359251413cb301c24c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1642819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tzachi Schiff","original_name":"Tzachi Schiff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b344648c3a3685314019107","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073785,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ofra Abramov","original_name":"Ofra Abramov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3446ed0e0a26401601eaa8","department":"Writing","job":"Script Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5594410","wikidata_id":"Q49996469","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/364RH3kaiIW8bh15TtPcXRS4c6k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw Jewish Film Festival)","release_date":"2017-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Philadelphia Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2017-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
