Unsure of what to do with his life, as well as a passion for medieval philosophy, Alexander rambles across the land of enchantment in search of something bigger than himself. Or maybe just something to do. Whether it's venturing out to find illegal substances with a sensitive burnout, developing a close bond with an aspiring intellectual or visiting his glump of a younger brother, Alexander stumbles into one misadventure after the next, with little to no concern for the consequences of his actions. THE GENERAL SPECIFIC is a goofy drama about loneliness, resentment, and narcissism.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/hMYqZNtHBHH5KgZIkm7zc6rfS1L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The General Specific","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliot Gross","original_name":"Elliot Gross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Alexander McHarren","credit_id":"5b32db740e0a263ffc0129e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabby Gillespie","original_name":"Gabby Gillespie","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Anna O'Hara","credit_id":"5b32db8c9251413ca0010fbd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Haworth","original_name":"Andrew Haworth","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Devin Fitzroy-McKellen","credit_id":"5b32dbacc3a368533700ff5a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2072979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasper Johnson","original_name":"Jasper Johnson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ronald Franzelbinder","credit_id":"5b32dbcb0e0a26400d012647","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Witosky","original_name":"Charles Witosky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ryan Tenorio","credit_id":"5b32dbe9c3a36853260155a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Romero","original_name":"Phil Romero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Brandon McHarren","credit_id":"5b32dbfe9251413c9d00eb2d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Wolff","original_name":"Taylor Wolff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Isa Maestas","credit_id":"5b32dc13c3a36853170149d6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","original_name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Santa Fe Yuppie #1","credit_id":"5b32dc5e0e0a26400d0126ba","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rory Hanrahan","original_name":"Rory Hanrahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Santa Fe Yuppie #2","credit_id":"5b32dc88c3a3685317014a97","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Rogers","original_name":"Marianne Rogers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Santa Fe Yuppie #3","credit_id":"5b32dca60e0a263ff8011e19","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","original_name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b32dcd2c3a3685335012d35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","original_name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b32dcc80e0a264002012d44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Haworth","original_name":"Andrew Haworth","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b32dd12c3a368532c0148ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","original_name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b32dd1a9251413c58013e7e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","original_name":"Matthew Stanasolovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b32dce39251413cb3011e66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Samuel Albert","original_name":"Samuel Albert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b32dd3b0e0a2640140142c7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Witosky","original_name":"Charles Witosky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b32dceec3a368530e013f5e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2072991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"S.J.
