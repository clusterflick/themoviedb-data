What unfolds is an emotionally-charged film about the human consequences of all conflicts--as seen through the eyes of 6 young women who are thoughtful, intelligent and articulate beyond their years.","popularity":0.0439,"poster_path":"/gCdp3uF2ZLRBE6B8f0ATwd9mcf6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My So-Called Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":60104,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eden Wurmfeld","original_name":"Eden Wurmfeld","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681d45cf3fbbf896034ae19","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379802,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Mehlman","original_name":"David Mehlman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681d49961dda9e59d9db74f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":107197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Schein","original_name":"Justin Schein","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681d484bec9e185679db7aa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Gossels","original_name":"Lisa Gossels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681d4e561dda9e59d9db754","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Gossels","original_name":"Lisa Gossels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681d4d13ffc4e3af711fce1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":958380,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toby Shimin","original_name":"Toby Shimin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681d4ab0c1a409d089db94e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Gossels","original_name":"Lisa Gossels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eed8f2a9661fc00386081e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1493812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gCdp3uF2ZLRBE6B8f0ATwd9mcf6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":612}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"My So-Called Enemy\" sample reel","key":"5kKOLI4t2XE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-08-25T08:18:36.000Z","id":"6681d33d34815f088311fcd4"}]}}}
