The view from the dock is, on one side, the Island of Vieques, and on the other; Vieques Sound--a passage that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean. The film is shot through a mirrored object, a formal experiment in order to transform and collapse the monumentality of the view, taking cues from shore fisherman who transform the base's use and meaning.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lTpcc08xroqVturFZP8wC72oVlE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otros Usos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatriz Santiago Muñoz","original_name":"Beatriz Santiago Muñoz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3274859251413c8e00ec96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1576,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lTpcc08xroqVturFZP8wC72oVlE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1051}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
