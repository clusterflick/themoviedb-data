This bleak portrait of loneliness and social exclusion is set on the edge of a desolate swamp where an aging clown and his daughter are struggling to survive. The location could be the end of the world, a place where hope has vanished along with a belief in the afterlife and the existence of God. The two unfortunates live together without the likelihood of change, as fear, aggression, and anger take hold of them – but they also experience sudden moments of tenderness.","popularity":0.6764,"poster_path":"/qYIMiVtlTI0YZgcf1y0ooHbxZtO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonder Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A chronicle of the relationship between a paranoid schizophrenic clown and his blind daughter.","title":"Reflections in the Dust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Houbolt","original_name":"Sarah Houbolt","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/zvKOhxyVqeMCF23GkNcm9HryxMW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Freckles","credit_id":"5b360d54c3a36853370244cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Queree","original_name":"Robin Queree","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/3nM9XnbTuvxYqByUmOCDeg0kuGX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Clown","credit_id":"603db323bb070d002bf26a1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2995451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Fedato","original_name":"Aldo Fedato","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bingo","credit_id":"603db3b0af4324002af56463","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2995427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sage Godrei","original_name":"Sage Godrei","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jo","credit_id":"603db3b9263462002f4c55a7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Sullivan","original_name":"Luke Sullivan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b360dc59251413c93029699","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Sullivan","original_name":"Luke Sullivan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b360dad0e0a26400402a30b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074558,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shaun Smith","original_name":"Shaun Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b360decc3a3685311027d96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074559,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Phillip Rowe","original_name":"Phillip Rowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b360e050e0a26400402a346","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288900,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryan Barry Cotter","original_name":"Ryan Barry Cotter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb422a4c3a36808a2ae800f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8012228","wikidata_id":"Q127600242","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2156,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lLLzWIlK4u6jYCqmYZiXnA0sz7w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3833}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":956,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qYIMiVtlTI0YZgcf1y0ooHbxZtO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":636},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yThCZey2RYKn9HI7lBSe2iHkdz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222981,"name":"monochrome"},{"id":242425,"name":"inclusion"},{"id":245415,"name":"toxic masculinity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Streaming Release - STAN ","release_date":"2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"World Premiere, Karlovy Vary International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Film Trailer: Reflections in the Dust","key":"IOUTP3UTHSs","published_at":"2018-06-29T08:38:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b360f3c0e0a263ffc02a89f"}]}}}
