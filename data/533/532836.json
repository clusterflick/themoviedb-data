Appearing with Muddy that night were his contemporaries Willie Dixon, Koko Taylor, Junior Wells and Pinetop Perkins, and from the next generation of blues lovers and performers, Mike Bloomfield, Buddy Miles, Johnny Winter, Dr. John, and Nick Gravenites -- all artists who were on their way to becoming legends themselves. What resulted from that joyous teaming was a truly historic session that not only presented some of the greatest blues classics ever written, but a never-to-be-forgotten hour that truly demonstrates the love of music by one generation for another.","popularity":0.3688,"poster_path":"/pmodKFv1DVoRbNbVuoMf7d8OZ1P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50946,"logo_path":"/1lTs6kx4LNc48mypKt9F0y5X3XH.png","name":"WTTW/Chicago","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soundstage Blues Summit In Chicago: Muddy Waters And Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muddy Waters","original_name":"Muddy Waters","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/4en6WXo8nUc5z2w3RTpUC4OcOST.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3668b50e0a26400d02d26a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Winter","original_name":"Johnny Winter","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3668c50e0a26400802c591","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1730654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Bloomfield","original_name":"Mike Bloomfield","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3668cf9251413c9b02b7ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":100709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junior Wells","original_name":"Junior Wells","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3668de0e0a263ff60291f4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. John","original_name":"Dr. John","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3668f9c3a36853320279eb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koko Taylor","original_name":"Koko Taylor","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/sGxZsU1qHorWuqEFQA15Oj42Bvm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b36692e0e0a26400802c5c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Dixon","original_name":"Willie Dixon","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3669479251413c7002df7f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Miles","original_name":"Buddy Miles","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3669540e0a26400402d45d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Gravenites","original_name":"Nick Gravenites","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b366978c3a368532c031c1a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinetop Perkins","original_name":"Pinetop Perkins","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self/Performer","credit_id":"5b3670be0e0a26401602f5be","order":9}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1435307","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmodKFv1DVoRbNbVuoMf7d8OZ1P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1974-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
