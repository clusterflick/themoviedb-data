Each new section presents a variation on the same sleek, kinetic minimalism. As each section progresses, the razor-sharp line between a host of binary oppositions—black/white, figure/ground, silence/sound, here/there, on/off — dissolves through sheer velocity. The rapid-fire alternation between these binary oppositions acts like the flicker of film frames, accelerating until sound and sight are wed into a synchronous whole in which neither the visual nor the sonic takes primacy. Instead, each acts as mutually constitutive literalisation of the other.  — Joseph Clayton Mills","popularity":0.2801,"poster_path":"/iStOVZtRYRR1Bwo5oUBaRyDLTwY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entr’acte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8 switches (Part 6)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Wright","original_name":"Tim Wright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b365067c3a3685317030d51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iStOVZtRYRR1Bwo5oUBaRyDLTwY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":245651,"name":"circles"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
