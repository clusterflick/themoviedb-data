The central idea of this short experimental film is the practise and significance of wig-wearing in Nollywood film; a practise the director has invested with deeper psychological as well as science-fiction layers. Underpinning this central idea however is a critique of the unforgiving treatment of single women in Nollywood and Nigeria. The film is an example of what the director, Zina Saro-Wiwa, has termed “alt-Nollywood”, a genre that plays with and reworks certain narrative, stylistic and visual conventions of Nollywood. Phyllis explores the gothic possibilities of the Nollywood aesthetic creating a new kind of low-budget atmospheric film that is very much of Nollywood and yet subverts the genre. Using Nollywood to subvert Nollywood.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72563,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZSW Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phyllis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olushola Adeyinka","original_name":"Olushola Adeyinka","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Phyllis","credit_id":"56a99add9251410e2d002c74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gboyega Babajide","original_name":"Gboyega Babajide","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Man on Staircase","credit_id":"56a99ae59251417db9002f95","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569201,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Opeyemi Fajemirokun","original_name":"Opeyemi Fajemirokun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Victim","credit_id":"56a99aed9251417db9002f9b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","original_name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53bdaa53c3a3684cec001f20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569203,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ben Grinberg","original_name":"Ben Grinberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a99ad09251417dcb0030cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","original_name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a99abac3a36872e100314a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569201,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Opeyemi Fajemirokun","original_name":"Opeyemi Fajemirokun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a99aae9251417db5002eab","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sese Somolu","original_name":"Sese Somolu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a99ac19251417dcb0030be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","original_name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a99a939251417db5002ea6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","original_name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a99ac89251417dcb0030c8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3313344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"},{"id":179572,"name":"nigerian cinema"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York African Film Festival","release_date":"2011-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
