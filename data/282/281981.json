[…] they wanted to \"blow up cinematic conventions and invent cinematic language from scratch\". The jazz pianist Bud Powell moves around Copenhagen -- through King's Garden, along the quay at Kalkbrænderihavnen, across a waste dump. […] Bud is alone, accompanied only by his music. […] Image and sound are two different things -- that's Leth's and John's principle. Dexter Gordon, the narrator, tells stories about Powell's famous left hand. In an obituary for Powell, dated 3 August 1966, Leth wrote: \"He quite willingly, or better still, unresistingly, mechanically, let himself be directed. The film attempts to depict his strange duality about his surroundings. His touch on the keys was like he was burning his fingers -- that's what it looked like, and that's how it sounded. But outside his playing, and often right in the middle of it, too, he was simply gone, not there.\"","popularity":0.3459,"poster_path":"/7KdTTkjMp16zMRrkOdLNmNRZGyS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1963-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stop for Bud","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422118,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bud Powell","original_name":"Bud Powell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Jazz Pianist","credit_id":"54cf87ca9251415fb3006e95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dexter Gordon","original_name":"Dexter Gordon","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/uXZ3KegarfYWQ7ANQq7hFKbXpg2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"54cf87d5c3a3687f820083d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen","original_name":"Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54cf8850925141475b008505","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jørn Elniff","original_name":"Jørn Elniff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54cf885ac3a3687f8400889f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Brüel","original_name":"Max Brüel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54cf8866925141475b008508","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ole John","original_name":"Ole John","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/44LzPR1RiWOdVPEBFFEApYdfCnI.jpg","credit_id":"53c442d2c3a3684cf4009cf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jens Jørgen Thorsen","original_name":"Jens Jørgen Thorsen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/w3iKLfaSUEySPwF8cHVpcNmZ8kO.jpg","credit_id":"53c44301c3a3687e5900998a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jørgen Leth","original_name":"Jørgen Leth","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/nyegklYsfvx8RnMjRdX4DfMIPVC.jpg","credit_id":"53c442e8c3a3684cf900a15a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ole John","original_name":"Ole John","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/44LzPR1RiWOdVPEBFFEApYdfCnI.jpg","credit_id":"57fd884bc3a3681f0b0018db","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ole John","original_name":"Ole John","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/44LzPR1RiWOdVPEBFFEApYdfCnI.jpg","credit_id":"57fd883892514109000018ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ole John","original_name":"Ole John","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/44LzPR1RiWOdVPEBFFEApYdfCnI.jpg","credit_id":"57fd8842c3a3681ec5001741","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422118,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bud Powell","original_name":"Bud Powell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586e53c69251412953007894","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0316685","wikidata_id":"Q20729551","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KdTTkjMp16zMRrkOdLNmNRZGyS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
