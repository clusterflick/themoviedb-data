Filmmaker Rea Tajiri’s family was among the 120,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans who were imprisoned in internment camps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. And like so many who were in the camps, Tajiri’s family wrapped their memories of that experience in a shroud of silence and forgetting. This film raises questions about collective history – questions that prompt Tajiri to daringly re-imagine and re-create what has been stolen and what has been lost.","popularity":0.3908,"poster_path":"/YlTk1vQeqQVqvlm9SHS7I1Flg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History and Memory: For Akiko and Takashige","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rea Tajiri","original_name":"Rea Tajiri","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/cFYTj8lRxUJdIa2wG9np5gZ7Bbh.jpg","credit_id":"60948ca9a2e602003a9af18e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rea Tajiri","original_name":"Rea Tajiri","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/cFYTj8lRxUJdIa2wG9np5gZ7Bbh.jpg","credit_id":"60948cbb87e63e003c30d1b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2501788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Davies","original_name":"Eric Davies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60948d17992fe6003c5fb5db","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rea Tajiri","original_name":"Rea Tajiri","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/cFYTj8lRxUJdIa2wG9np5gZ7Bbh.jpg","credit_id":"60948cb2f8e982003ebfa0c5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081570,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Angel Velasco Shaw","original_name":"Angel Velasco Shaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60948ccae039f1003c1f0800","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rea Tajiri","original_name":"Rea Tajiri","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/cFYTj8lRxUJdIa2wG9np5gZ7Bbh.jpg","credit_id":"53be4d20c3a3684cf4002b91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4683629,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Noel Shaw","original_name":"Noel Shaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66302f37e488600127e6a4b2","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Writing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4683630,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sokhi Wagner","original_name":"Sokhi Wagner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66302f4b75110d0125b9f6d2","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Writing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081571,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Burden","original_name":"Robert Burden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66302edf4dc34a012b6555d0","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0285191","wikidata_id":"Q19874222","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2180,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/YlTk1vQeqQVqvlm9SHS7I1Flg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1544},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/u8nk0OFLTg9iBZmiLJz8o4m29Xg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3365,"name":"pearl harbor"},{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":195140,"name":"japanese american internment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Whitney Biennial","release_date":"1991-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
