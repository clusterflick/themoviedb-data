Inside is a million dollars in cash and cocaine, stolen from one of the biggest drug kingpins in the country. A death warrant is issued for whoever gets pinned with its theft.  A man, in order to clear up the legal claims against the company he has bought, must travel to a desolate island accessible only by plane.

All in all, he embarks on a bad trip.","popularity":0.1211,"poster_path":"/w1JPmuYONmyg8Q1PzBLMvydcRzR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Getting there is only half the nightmare","title":"Bad Trip","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino Castegno","original_name":"Dino Castegno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Snelling","credit_id":"62bdb66663d93707fef38ec9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy S Young","original_name":"Randy S Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jimmy Johnson","credit_id":"62bdb6858b959e140cf83f60","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Henry Schmeer","original_name":"Jon Henry Schmeer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Fat Eddy","credit_id":"62bdb6a7229ae22291cd56e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Simmons","original_name":"Bill Simmons","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Olly Norton","credit_id":"62bdb6cd9a9f9a006143ade6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randall Lakefish","original_name":"Randall Lakefish","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Richard Bernstein","credit_id":"62bdb6d6229ae22290065523","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Goff","original_name":"Joanna Goff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tess","credit_id":"62bdb715eb64f1058b684473","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2263367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Davis","original_name":"Michael Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Edwards","credit_id":"62bdb728da10f0005259a2f6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lester Harmon","original_name":"Lester Harmon","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Carson","credit_id":"62bdb7379a9f9a006143ae2d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":98446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Hanna","original_name":"Mark Hanna","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mikey","credit_id":"62bdb752229ae22291cd5760","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Batarseh","original_name":"Mia Batarseh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Carrie","credit_id":"62bdb77a9a9f9a008bf7b6d9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Shepherd","original_name":"Cynthia Shepherd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"62bdb795097c490ba55630d0","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131184,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phillip J.
