The effect of the changing economy and politics on the city and its inhabitants is echoed through their physical relocation to its outer edges. In 1990, squatters proclaim a socialist republic on the death strip. Eight years later, the new headquarters of Mercedes Benz are built in the same location. The film makes use of slow super-impositions to uncover a journey across changing architectural and cultural boundaries. \"The Empty Centre\" tries to give a voice and a history to those who continue to be marginalised by the simultaneous dismantling and reconstruction of the borders which they are trying to cross.","popularity":0.1131,"poster_path":"/c3CCI84RRWL0qAEHuexsda9VJc3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Empty Center","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dong Yang","original_name":"Dong Yang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"53bf2dbd0e0a26157600523c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huan Zhu","original_name":"Huan Zhu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"53bf2df30e0a26158f004ee8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2916,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Friedrich Hollaender","original_name":"Friedrich Hollaender","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/mbK3xSgCQg66FF0n9QQv9nIC8TV.jpg","credit_id":"53bf2d510e0a26158900527f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evi Stangassinger","original_name":"Evi Stangassinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53bf2edcc3a3687e590038ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168199,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Su Turhan","original_name":"Su Turhan","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/50cFLk53DMhvouBaJ7VqBgX6IWZ.jpg","credit_id":"53bf2f5b0e0a2615850050bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hito Steyerl","original_name":"Hito Steyerl","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/dL8oPhT9JdVYfPqvGUK8CrODNgY.jpg","credit_id":"53bf2b960e0a261579004fb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy","original_name":"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3I5evWG25USrWvH4jxVVtBrYhIK.jpg","credit_id":"53bf2d310e0a26157c004f07","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17555366","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c3CCI84RRWL0qAEHuexsda9VJc3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
