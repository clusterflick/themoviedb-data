Then the \"dead man\" will suddenly show up at his partner's murder trial. Unfortunately, things don't quite go as planned. For one thing, no one seems to much care that the \"dead man\" is missing, and for another thing he's mistaken for the leader of a Balkan revolutionary group and is kidnapped by the other side.","popularity":0.3999,"poster_path":"/fFYxqT5wkvLQlYvsXlMiCMhmeBc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trio Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":42416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Buchanan Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1938-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Break the News","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Fausses nouvelles","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Buchanan","original_name":"Jack Buchanan","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/5cDC7j4ZQBkf3gmpL39jjLzQJe8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Teddy Enton","credit_id":"53c11444c3a3684cdb006c37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Chevalier","original_name":"Maurice Chevalier","popularity":0.2412,"profile_path":"/zABRw3iRFqqKV0xB3Z3VcsJDfad.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"François Verrier","credit_id":"53c1144bc3a3684cec00668c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Knight","original_name":"June Knight","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/bXfqG6PinlXCfcByfFwBvGxOZ2C.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grace Gatwick","credit_id":"53c11453c3a3684cdb006c3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":600333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Labarr","original_name":"Marta Labarr","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sonia","credit_id":"54a19edb925141313200cfcd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1026388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Musgrove","original_name":"Gertrude Musgrove","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/f1epgujH4qrBtq44GC1KReaE7br.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Helena","credit_id":"54a19efd925141190d001cd0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Clair","original_name":"René Clair","popularity":0.2302,"profile_path":"/m6pYOo5Yp2N4i6egvVFXYOnmS82.jpg","credit_id":"53c11439c3a3684cec006689","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Clair","original_name":"René Clair","popularity":0.2302,"profile_path":"/m6pYOo5Yp2N4i6egvVFXYOnmS82.jpg","credit_id":"54a19e75c3a3682f2100d476","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193824,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Geoffrey Kerr","original_name":"Geoffrey Kerr","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a19e7f9251412127004226","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34326,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philip Tannura","original_name":"Philip Tannura","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551bdb01c3a3687670002cd9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029944","wikidata_id":"Q970195","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/n8f4R14c6fS4pdpELJWXhiXW5ed.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1917,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fFYxqT5wkvLQlYvsXlMiCMhmeBc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1278},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1147,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sGS3Md4nIiImZSkHJb5SJFDqnzI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":765}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Wien, Ring-Film, Neubaugasse 11","release_date":"1939-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1938-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
