It deals with a bitter feud between two farmers who had taken opposite sides in the Irish Civil War many years before and who had also fought for the love of the same woman. When the feud is reawakened in the '50s it causes a major upheaval with tragic consequences for the lives of the two men, their families and the community.  As the story unfolds it embraces many of the great, lingering issues affecting Ireland in this century - the War of Independence, the Civil War, emigration, the links with America, the clash between traditional, conservative values and those of a new technological age.","popularity":0.1297,"poster_path":"/zBtnicIPsUU6Dn4dfbPQBSbgzZ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Destiny Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1994-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Harvest","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":220868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Lane","original_name":"Colin Lane","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Arthur O'Leary","credit_id":"62caf81646aed4087e86d90e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":171374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Quinn","original_name":"Marian Quinn","popularity":0.21,"profile_path":"/v1KRG4o7H50ZEsAWfgy4p5JRLwe.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Catherine O'Leary","credit_id":"62caf8214b9bae0a516146bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niall O'Brien","original_name":"Niall O'Brien","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Josie McCarthy","credit_id":"62caf82d4a4bfc004d1b01ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darren McHugh","original_name":"Darren McHugh","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Jimmy O'Leary","credit_id":"62caf83b595a5612ba107f34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Jeffers","original_name":"Joe Jeffers","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Willie Hogan","credit_id":"62caf844fd4a960064f2fe68","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joy Florish","original_name":"Joy Florish","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Mary Finnegan","credit_id":"62caf84fa9117f004f80bbae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Queally","original_name":"Jim Queally","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Master O'Donnell","credit_id":"62caf858a9117f004c16e15b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Twomey","original_name":"Michael Twomey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Bank Manager","credit_id":"62caf8dd46aed4087dbae880","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice O'Callaghan","original_name":"Maurice O'Callaghan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62caf74dfd4a96004fba3496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice O'Callaghan","original_name":"Maurice O'Callaghan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62caf752fd4a960064f2fe0d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate O'Callaghan","original_name":"Kate O'Callaghan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62caf75de24b93004f052370","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618802,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jerry O'Callaghan","original_name":"Jerry O'Callaghan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62caf775498bc21466d33eb8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice O'Callaghan","original_name":"Maurice O'Callaghan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62caf780a9117f0054f1809e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":18984,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"J.
