Sublime tears through 27 songs, including their hits 'Date Rape,' 'Badfish,' and '40 Oz To Freedom,' as well as covers of classic songs that reflect the band's broad stylistic range of influences ('54-46 Was My Number' by Toots & the Maytals, 'House of Suffering' by Bad Brains and the Grateful Dead's 'Scarlet Begonias'). More than 78 minutes of the band's performance and on-stage antics are on full display in a sold-out setting, with remastered and remixed multi-source live audio culled from the original master tapes.","popularity":0.0831,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sublime | 3 Ring Circus: Live at The Palace, Hollywood, CA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Nowell","original_name":"Bradley Nowell","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56906edd925141456d000ab5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Wilson","original_name":"Eric Wilson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56906f26925141456a000aab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Gaugh","original_name":"Bud Gaugh","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56906f09c3a3686b47000a68","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
