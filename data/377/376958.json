Two alley cats, looking over a fence, see Champ in his attire and begin razzing him. Champ does a slow turn and starts after the cats and, in no time, the studio is a shambles. Doc sees an announcement of a dog show, the winner of which receives a $50,000 prize and a banquet. Desperately in need of money, Doc gets the idea of entering Champ in the upcoming show and begins grooming him. Doc gives Champ a bath, lessons in proper speech, walking with books balanced on head, and the proper attire.","popularity":0.2823,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pest of  Show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Doc (voice)","credit_id":"5692c653c3a3684cfc002f4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dal McKennon","original_name":"Dal McKennon","popularity":0.2888,"profile_path":"/7ke4WPwpxVsSsYfoibCKEmrI56V.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"(voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"66f83401a6293e3d76a218a9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Hannah","original_name":"Jack Hannah","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/kWFFTlq7VEjbRho2pWLT2zAD05Q.jpg","credit_id":"5692c6939251417095000324","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1561718,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Priest","original_name":"Frank Priest","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5692c70f9251414257000896","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151945","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":977,"name":"cat"},{"id":338226,"name":"anthropomorphic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1962-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
