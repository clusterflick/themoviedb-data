In the spectacular setting of a former submarine factory, American director and universal artist Robert Wilson creates a poetic visual world in which the mystical musical language of the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt can cast its meditative spell. Three of Pärt’s major works – Adam’s Lament, Tabula rasa, and Miserere, as well as Sequentia, a new work composed especially for this production – are brought together here using light, space, and movement to create a tightly-woven Gesamtkunstwerk in which the artistic visions of these two great artists mirror each other.","popularity":0.2546,"poster_path":"/wkeCLuMXNnbxSTPjlw9U49DjWci.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adam's Passion","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1560570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michalis Theophanous","original_name":"Michalis Theophanous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Man","credit_id":"5c821788c3a3684e89d7a0b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169225,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucinda Childs","original_name":"Lucinda Childs","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/qdyh4pV5z2EFArDwBAbrOp2MjqX.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"5c8217bd0e0a264314600445","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Wilson","original_name":"Robert Wilson","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/c2NHsGT1n1QmHlWkVKKzZ7Wy4Pm.jpg","credit_id":"61c17dbea217c0001c02985b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arvo Pärt","original_name":"Arvo Pärt","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/bq7OliFL8gf9ERIck9jhPivfv7z.jpg","credit_id":"56911d42c3a3686b41002458","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431139,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carlos Soto","original_name":"Carlos Soto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56911dbb92514145650025db","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037856,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nyika Jancsó","original_name":"Nyika Jancsó","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661d6f1e931ea1018665e079","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139125,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Smaczny","original_name":"Paul Smaczny","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/fRVXsWwbRhsVjVJgCFVsEpF4JKC.jpg","credit_id":"5c8214fe0e0a264314600110","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Sommer","original_name":"Andy Sommer","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8214d90e0a2643146000fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079037,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steffen Herrmann","original_name":"Steffen Herrmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c82181592514127631c5073","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Wilson","original_name":"Robert Wilson","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/c2NHsGT1n1QmHlWkVKKzZ7Wy4Pm.jpg","credit_id":"5c821761c3a3684e89d7a07f","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8070038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7XEI6TBhzz8o2fOWyWEvqh7GDzY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":801},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wkeCLuMXNnbxSTPjlw9U49DjWci.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
