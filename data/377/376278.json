The Rigoletto, Zeljko Lucic, ran the gamut from tenderness with his Gilda to thundering fury with everyone else. I also liked the production. At first, when Rigoletto was putting on his grease paint during the overture, I was afraid that it might be a typical \"Euro-trash\" production, with a bit of warmed over I Pagliacci. But the sets and dramatic action really served the music and libretto. I would have to say that I came to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the story and characters as a result of seeing this performance.","popularity":0.5049,"poster_path":"/k2O0FrtJ5ZMcIHvN4lGdJYT7HpW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgin Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rigoletto (2008) Staatsoper Dresden.
