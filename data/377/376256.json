On any given day, principal Vonda Viland calls kids at the crack of dawn to see if they’ll make it to school. And if they need a ride? Well, she’ll pick them up. Vonda knows each student’s challenges and coaches them tirelessly, never fostering false hopes. Her philosophy combines loving compassion with realism, and given her school’s rising graduation rate, it seems to be working.","popularity":0.2373,"poster_path":"/u06QPcJJOp3CS80kOKgXNpfuk2d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90235,"logo_path":null,"name":"Low Key Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bad Kids","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Buruma","original_name":"Ian Buruma","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5916ab23c3a36840aa028db9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cai Guoqiang","original_name":"Cai Guoqiang","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5916ab30925141583c02c0ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wen-You Cai","original_name":"Wen-You Cai","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5916ab3cc3a3683a9302ad9a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wenhao Cai","original_name":"Wenhao Cai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5916ab4892514156f502d6cd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Fulton","original_name":"Keith Fulton","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/nDjDMMkwm2DtHKNvPXPU6L3gWvn.jpg","credit_id":"569fd7d592514137d6002c4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Pepe","original_name":"Louis Pepe","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/vxKrRYk2AloCDezJmfaZbDnLb1c.jpg","credit_id":"569fd838c3a36858e500b102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacaszek","original_name":"Jacaszek","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/6R14UCTZod7bweP2pF8VjtKDNDd.jpg","credit_id":"6386543f5ed8e9007ba40395","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065153,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jacob Bricca","original_name":"Jacob Bricca","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/uS2Bw0MyL1yFS29sopJ93PhWl7U.jpg","credit_id":"5916a432925141583c02bb41","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":958839,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mary Lampson","original_name":"Mary Lampson","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/xvidFLC2Zn25k79CJSyLyFzGPuV.jpg","credit_id":"5916a422925141572302cc78","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5278458","wikidata_id":"Q24635061","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/54FGFnRNUpzFj7sXejs0MtJbxq4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u06QPcJJOp3CS80kOKgXNpfuk2d.jpg","vote_average":10,"vote_count":6,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wvJ4PzF95e93Eiwucjo96zGktsT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1021}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2016-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Bad Kids Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Documentary","key":"-gHRZKRuuRk","published_at":"2016-10-27T20:55:56.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"581757079251415c5e01c4fc"}]}}}
