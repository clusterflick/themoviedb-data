After a particularly crappy week, he goes off on a tirade and harasses a gorgeous random passerby, only to discover that it’s Rochelle Marseille, one of New York’s up-and-coming authors. Moving to make amends in an effort to preserve his media clout, Ray is stunned when Rochelle gives him more than he ever thought she would.","popularity":1.1615,"poster_path":"/yZdCmQ806QqkFscC3K2TT9WE0ce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How To Tell You're A Douchebag","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1562982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Brice","original_name":"Charles Brice","popularity":0.1993,"profile_path":"/5nOWMA0RkOZ55d5ypcBKxpmUqV7.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ray Livingston","credit_id":"5696dc3fc3a3683af50002ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":206425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DeWanda Wise","original_name":"DeWanda Wise","popularity":0.7082,"profile_path":"/daQjduDoTzaDTC6SIsGWs55dzcM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rochelle Marseilles","credit_id":"5696dc3f92514154cc0002ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Jackson Harper","original_name":"William Jackson Harper","popularity":0.8095,"profile_path":"/5Oy037YttIweiqNGaErkalNmH0G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jake Brown","credit_id":"5696dc3fc3a3683af0000291","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander C.
