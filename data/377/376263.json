What he finds is a complicated mix of tragedy and inspiration in the various ways climate change is affecting our value systems. How to Let Go of the World delivers a sobering portrait of the state of climate change, and takes stock of what makes humans survivors, and our societies so creative and resilient.","popularity":0.3291,"poster_path":"/eZEOvacyC5Bfl7eX1D5umNr8E8R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8790,"logo_path":null,"name":"International WOW Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":971346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill McKibben","original_name":"Bill McKibben","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57570bd3c3a36859ab000359","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim DeChristopher","original_name":"Tim DeChristopher","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57570bfa92514154fa0002d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Van Jones","original_name":"Van Jones","popularity":0.1615,"profile_path":"/lh6KOxZiM90jk2swWpsRB0UxTW0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57570c0fc3a36859a700039b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Chou","original_name":"Ella Chou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57570c28c3a36859bd000369","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1702118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael E.
