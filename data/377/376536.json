This splendid, multi-generational mash-up features Sun Yunfan's visually vibrant animations, a plentiful offering from the Shankar family archives, and a live musical performance by filmmakers Gingger Shankar and Dave Liang. Nari triumphantly sings a rich and emotionally moving tribute to Lakshmi Shankar's important, yet unsung musical legacy in America.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
