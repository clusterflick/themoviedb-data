It affects not only his powers of speech, but also causes cramps and stiffness. When he speaks, his words cluster together, and when he walks it is with difficulty. With a normal intelligence in a weakened body Jacob is the embodiment of the problem ‘what is normality’: he is too much of an invalid to be fully accepted by society and too ordinary for him to be able to accept his own fate.","popularity":0.1831,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natural Disorder","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Nossell","original_name":"Jacob Nossell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xWqBEXSE89zEaFoDKFT2ZJqWmTp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56f2acdbc3a3680766001cb7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pilou Asbæk","original_name":"Pilou Asbæk","popularity":1.4143,"profile_path":"/hUJAtjbYG7rqm54aoWtNWeeKjTY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"56f2acee9251415543001902","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Bang","original_name":"Simon Bang","popularity":0.0576,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56f2ad00925141553f0019be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas L.
