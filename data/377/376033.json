Whether on land, at sea, or (most recently) in the air human beings have shown remarkable initiative in developing an evergrowing assortment of hardcore hardware.  In many ways, wars are won in the workshop. Of course, military leaders have to learn how to make the best use of weapons like catapults, Greek Fire (incendiary missiles pioneered by the Byzantine navy during the 7th century AD), dreadnoughts, U-Boats, and A-Bombs but obtaining access to these things can be more than half the battle.
