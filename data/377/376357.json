Every family, at some point, has had somebody leave their native country behind to search for a better life. How did they hold onto their identity? How did they adapt to their new life? Every family has a special story. In my case, it's my Chinese-American story. My father would always tell us his story about walking for 7 days and 6 nights, before swimming for 4 hours to Macau to escape communism in 1966. His story would fall on my deaf ears until I returned to China with him.","popularity":0.644,"poster_path":"/nTI5G5RSQQKZUY98OIwKluDGlLE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every American story starts somewhere else.","title":"My Life in China","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yau King Eng","original_name":"Yau King Eng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb46a3d92514135512136c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Eng","original_name":"Kenneth Eng","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57885e83c3a36874060003ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ehren Parks","original_name":"Ehren Parks","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb46a2a0e0a2626ceca8c09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4184494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"MyLifeInChina","instagram_id":"mylifeinchina","twitter_id":"mlicdoc"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/649upIlEA0cr24AV3nRNrVeRIOH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nTI5G5RSQQKZUY98OIwKluDGlLE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":862,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zPpNRvilVZzVez1IhkyGMK1G8jJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1025,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/crVkeJAkD6uqLLXIogXv5FAlNEf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":478,"name":"china"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":2355,"name":"american dream"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Life In China - OFFICIAL TRAILER","key":"161994736","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-04-07T21:41:27.000Z","id":"5d7dbb753c43440014a11f7b"}]}}}
