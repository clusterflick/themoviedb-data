On the way home she stops for a cup of coffee and meets Tony and Frankie, a couple of bumbling mobsters who have just completed a large “deal”. When they leave the coffee shop their backpacks get switched.  The mayhem begins when Ally discovers she has a bag full of mob money and Sal, the mob boss finds the “morons” have brought back the wrong bag full of nursing books. Sal gives Tony and Frankie one hour to retrieve the money while Ally tries to convince Steve to keep it.
