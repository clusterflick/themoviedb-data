When he discovers he's being given the \"run-around\", he tries to get his revenge on them (and on Cecil the bulldog) but all his attempts fail miserably.","popularity":0.4424,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1959-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mouse Trapped","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Doc (voice)","credit_id":"5691880292514179a3000b21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dal McKennon","original_name":"Dal McKennon","popularity":0.2888,"profile_path":"/7ke4WPwpxVsSsYfoibCKEmrI56V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hickory (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5691881e92514179a3000b24","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Lovy","original_name":"Alex Lovy","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/txGj5oXMl7rVvHwDQsOeichoFIH.jpg","credit_id":"56918855c3a36802e2000bd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151644","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2161,"name":"mouse"},{"id":240027,"name":"mice"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":338226,"name":"anthropomorphic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1959-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
