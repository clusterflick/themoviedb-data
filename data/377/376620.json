Between them, hundreds of TV shows, an international standup career, Summer in P1, one Kristall, countless debates, several rounds of Sweden on tour, a number of awards such as the comedy of the year, successful radio shows, the year's hot and award-winning podcasts. Now they go together to avoid loneliness on the roads. With standup as a constant starting point, the two biggest satirics on the Swedish scene now form an unbeatable duo where they get racism, zombies and review the reviewers. Naked, hard and honest, they dissect our contemporary. Two comedians who ignore trends and allow society to set the agenda rather than the audience. No matter whether they upset or touch, nobody will leave the show untouched.","popularity":0.1548,"poster_path":"/2iahor9k9AsRVW8QYzZWPtdqyDM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shame for Swedish: Magnus Betnér och Soran Ismail","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"En skam för Sverige: Magnus Betnér och Soran Ismail","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soran Ismail","original_name":"Soran Ismail","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/zlBTA3TFjt5vkM6S7i5eH94yl08.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56905b96c3a3686b4e0004d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Betnér","original_name":"Magnus Betnér","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/bByGNeU4gRiza0XmE05KVEJrQxh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56905ba9c3a3686b470004c6","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d9zPZxc53eHyVaE42uo5JVnPfHP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2iahor9k9AsRVW8QYzZWPtdqyDM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
