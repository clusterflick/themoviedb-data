Featuring an extremely talented and creative group working in a diverse array of styles, the shorts wander through strange and sometimes sketchy landscapes, including alternate-universe appliance stores, the ramblings of Charles Manson, environmental catastrophes in the Dutch style of painting, and a houseplant’s musings. Some, like Sally Cruikshank’s Make Me Psychic, are established classics; others feature newer animators working in looping GIF format, presented away from the small screen’s momentary pleasures to fully appreciate the art that it is. Occasionally gross, often beautiful, and always interesting, HEAD SPACE is a sampler of the thoughts happening inside and out of each frame.","popularity":0.1536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1356464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Signe Baumane","original_name":"Signe Baumane","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/129bHF4I35q1ymDYChlpR8GYwXU.jpg","credit_id":"56916e3292514179a00009e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyla Ribot","original_name":"Lyla Ribot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916fa692514179a300077f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Lockhart","original_name":"Amy Lockhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/unZDaV1DcsRNoQPtdA9dttwypKH.jpg","credit_id":"56916f4a92514179ac000805","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Van Ryzin","original_name":"Claire Van Ryzin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916f6b92514179a0000a00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Crafts","original_name":"Lisa Crafts","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916f7d92514179b000088d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faye Kahn","original_name":"Faye Kahn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916f9092514179b0000892","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendy Zhao","original_name":"Wendy Zhao","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916fc4c3a36802f6000884","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1084364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally Cruikshank","original_name":"Sally Cruikshank","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/fyf1PtLk1NaLRdok6gACYGU276Y.jpg","credit_id":"56916e5092514179ac0007ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Celeste Lai","original_name":"Celeste Lai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916e7f92514179aa00078a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Penelope Gazin","original_name":"Penelope Gazin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/vyvgD3ywVMhJdvrtzCF1UPCpPg1.jpg","credit_id":"56916ee5c3a36802e20007b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leah Shore","original_name":"Leah Shore","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916e6592514179a300075f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peyton Skyler","original_name":"Peyton Skyler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916e9fc3a36802f9000811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Benes","original_name":"Barbara Benes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56916ec892514179b3000829","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
