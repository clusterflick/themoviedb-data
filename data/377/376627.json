They are snapshots of various situations and locations, as in this program of nine miniatures, shot in hotel rooms and parks, at the shore of a lake, and – in the longest contribution – on a restaurant terrace. Rousseau’s observations of everyday life, however, are about precision rather than contemplation. With each minute that passes, they sharpen the view of the observant and expectant outsider for a moment of surprise – be it a jump into the water or a huge crucifix.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/rlN5HHezVKmzUbyohe6bXbuV7UD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","original_name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rA7KgE9IrUnUK7HFaoA9cKeg5Xn.jpg","credit_id":"56905db2925141456100057a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","original_name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rA7KgE9IrUnUK7HFaoA9cKeg5Xn.jpg","credit_id":"67d30fb2a97c646cb5813729","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rlN5HHezVKmzUbyohe6bXbuV7UD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
