But director Fujii has taken the \"behind the scenes\"-concept to unprecedented heights with this unique documentary offering a close look into the world of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the auteur. Scenes from the surprisingly low key and relaxed production of \"Bright Future\" are of course sprinkled liberally throughout the documentary, but between these we are treated to interesting and revealing interviews with actors, producers and Kurosawa's many other collaborators. And perhaps the most surprising thing of all is how much of Kurosawa there is, talking candidly about his working methods and the philosophy behind it all.","popularity":0.4549,"poster_path":"/ecz9gekeRRcs12lunVt4F6Lsent.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uplink","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ambivalent Future: Kiyoshi Kurosawa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Aimai na Mirai: Kurosawa Kiyoshi","type":"Japanese title in Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiyoshi Kurosawa","original_name":"黒沢清","popularity":0.8878,"profile_path":"/jddYE0uzNicgSPFKDTV29OUPhjP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56911f12c3a3686b55002506","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132792,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Takashi Asai","original_name":"Takashi Asai","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/v1VPOHumZjpRm9DRZiNslBKlHYh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56911f27c3a3686b4900267b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tadanobu Asano","original_name":"浅野忠信","popularity":1.4143,"profile_path":"/wDw1z9Pk9dEzopzlZQ4X8wTbj1t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56911f3b92514145630026ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuya Fuji","original_name":"藤竜也","popularity":0.7435,"profile_path":"/vfQBWOKFztXYexzNmKmaFJ8hT0E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56911f5b92514145610024cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132801,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Yasuaki Harada","original_name":"原田恭明","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56911fcbc3a3686b410024a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132802,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Michiko Kitamura","original_name":"北村道子","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/7deTGeTpweaifistN91rsVtDiO8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56911fdec3a3686b4e0025c0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Odagiri","original_name":"オダギリジョー","popularity":0.6629,"profile_path":"/jjbwOodtQeVcTwO9oUbLOGjjHDP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56911ff1c3a3686b4e0025c4","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1560584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenjirō Fujii","original_name":"Kenjirō Fujii","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5691202392514166ea000aef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1560584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenjirō Fujii","original_name":"Kenjirō Fujii","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5691203592514145700025bb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1560584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenjirō Fujii","original_name":"Kenjirō Fujii","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56912045925141456a00259b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132792,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Takashi Asai","original_name":"Takashi Asai","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/v1VPOHumZjpRm9DRZiNslBKlHYh.jpg","credit_id":"56912060925141456500262e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1180719","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uqBD9UQ1OjIxmG6AqhZtgE4hdh5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":826,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vhIv1Xj2mI6GOB9PbR8qKtUYVG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/ecz9gekeRRcs12lunVt4F6Lsent.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Oslo International Film Festival","release_date":"2003-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
