From its inception, that conflict has also, of course, had powerful and deeply troubling consequences for Israelis and Palestinians themselves. The story at its most basic level is one that involves two peoples struggling for national recognition and expression in a small but richly significant piece of land. The tragedy of this history, as both the Israeli novelist, Amos Oz, and the Palestinian scholar, Sari Nusseibeh, have each pointed out, stems from a conflict between the rights of two peoples with equal and legitimate aspirations to nationhood and self-expression in a single small territory to which they can both lay claim.","popularity":0.1713,"poster_path":"/uw2p3GAnzcJnfGjCwiR8q65lAS0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31775,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthos Media","origin_country":""},{"id":90318,"logo_path":"/kSZSPHRAXSoCd6QqGFLoZbpX3DE.png","name":"Riverside Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":90319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oren Rudavsky Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2015-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colliding Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oren Rudavsky","original_name":"Oren Rudavsky","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"585f073992514115cd01445e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":656971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Dorman","original_name":"Joseph Dorman","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"585f071a92514115c4015542","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096296,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aaron Kuhn","original_name":"Aaron Kuhn","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5917600dc3a368371b0273ac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939508,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick August-Perna","original_name":"Nick August-Perna","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/tXeMcNYb3ntC1Esl23nzSH9wXcs.jpg","credit_id":"59176015c3a3683a93034273","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816155,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Miller","original_name":"Andrea Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5917606792514105da02d2fb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oren Rudavsky","original_name":"Oren Rudavsky","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5917603f92514105da02d2cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816149,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ahavia Scheindlin","original_name":"Ahavia Scheindlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591760379251415723036db1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":656971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Dorman","original_name":"Joseph Dorman","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5917601ec3a36840aa031b42","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816148,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carla Solomon","original_name":"Carla Solomon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5917602f925141580d035d84","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oren Rudavsky","original_name":"Oren Rudavsky","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59175fab925141583c0357fd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3891218","wikidata_id":"Q57803949","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uw2p3GAnzcJnfGjCwiR8q65lAS0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New York Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2015-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Colliding Dreams Trailer (2015)","key":"7UChvMGkjEg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-12-15T19:58:46.000Z","id":"64bf81068ee49c00c4b83d34"}]}}}
