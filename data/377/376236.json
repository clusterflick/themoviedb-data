And that’s just the tipping point in this stranger-than-fiction tale. With the balls of a P.T. Barnum, the gonads of goats, and the wishful dreams of flaccid men, Brinkley amassed a fortune, was almost elected Governor of Kansas, invented junk mail and the infomercial, and built the world’s most powerful radio station. By the time all of the twists and turns of Brinkley’s story are revealed, Nuts! certainly earns its title.","popularity":0.4448,"poster_path":"/rytoWiX1qVM0B1MvfAWwMGulKT6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gland Power Films","origin_country":""},{"id":72768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cartuna","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuts!","video":false,"vote_average":6.741,"vote_count":29,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"癫狂！","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Tognacci","original_name":"Gene Tognacci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Narrator","credit_id":"56b1b705c3a3687e36001a25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Boswell","original_name":"Andy Boswell","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"56b1b705c3a3687e5100193a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Causby","original_name":"John Causby","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"56b1b70592514166d5001178","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Mizell","original_name":"Kelly Mizell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"56b1b706c3a368621b0025fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Pillars","original_name":"Jeff Pillars","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"56b1b706c3a3687e5100193f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571942,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thom Stylinski","original_name":"Thom Stylinski","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"56b1b706c3a36862090025b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fran Taylor","original_name":"Fran Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"56b1b70792514171f100109f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pope Brok","original_name":"Pope Brok","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b1b7079251412645001a55","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Fowler","original_name":"Gene Fowler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b1b7079251414074002485","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. James Reardon","original_name":"Dr. James Reardon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b1b707c3a3687e36001a2a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Seaholm","original_name":"Megan Seaholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56b1b70892514126ba001a6b","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John R.
