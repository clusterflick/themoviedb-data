A beatnik coffee house owner is impressed and signs them up to entertain at his swinging club. Doc stages concerts for the talented but pain-ridden pooch. Doc, at the piano, rehearses Champ with great success, making several teenage cats swoon. Opening night at \"The Hungry Me\" pad is also a great success- their act creating enthuasiastic finger-snapping by the beatniks. The two become famous as Champ does a great beat presentation after Doc's piano intro and after being hit on the foot!","popularity":0.1402,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corny Concerto","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Doc (voice)","credit_id":"5692c96cc3a3684cf8002da0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Hannah","original_name":"Jack Hannah","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/kWFFTlq7VEjbRho2pWLT2zAD05Q.jpg","credit_id":"5692c9bc925141445300079f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150037,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Detiege","original_name":"David Detiege","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5692c9adc3a3684d040030a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150201","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1962-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
