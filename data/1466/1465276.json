Police Inspector Manuel Salas (Félix Loreto) leads the investigation into a series of brutal homicides: women murdered with razor blades, raped, and with a rose as the only clue. As the serial killer continues, the time between each crime decreases, increasing the urgency of catching him.  As the case unfolds, Manuel meets Marisa (Mimí Lazo) and her teenage daughter, Christina, after Marisa finds the body of one of the victims. Accidentally implicated, she collaborates with the police, which strengthens her relationship with Manuel, leading to a romance.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Una Rosa por Testigo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimí Lazo","original_name":"Mimí Lazo","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/eVWWptwrZXh2cCqvKlkecshIKdN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67ff259d3110bd82dfad9c36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Escolano","original_name":"Manuel Escolano","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67ff25a93110bd82dfad9c3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Loreto","original_name":"Félix Loreto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67ff25b561b1c4bb3299940e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo de la Barra","original_name":"Pablo de la Barra","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5MRv9bFrHP1guVQ2YC2pFKtbUrp.jpg","credit_id":"67ff250661b1c4bb329993fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo de la Barra","original_name":"Pablo de la Barra","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5MRv9bFrHP1guVQ2YC2pFKtbUrp.jpg","credit_id":"67ff251f3110bd82dfad9c0a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
