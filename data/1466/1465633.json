The film's focus is on one group of refugees, former members of the Cooperative Communities of the Ixcan Grande who are now attempting to resume their lives in the land they fled under terrible circumstances in the early 1980's. The return of the refugees has been an extremely important event in this struggle. The ability of the refugees to re-establish their lives in peace and security is seen as a test case for the entire society and is being closely watched both in Guatemala and throughout the world. The film celebrates their courage, determination and accomplishments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":259620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lazybank Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"}],"release_date":"1999-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to Mayalan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135567,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Markham","original_name":"Nigel Markham","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/qkj2OkKXpEFgD9x9Djp1dn4TEez.jpg","credit_id":"67fffaa2aacf7cfb2699f6e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135567,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Markham","original_name":"Nigel Markham","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/qkj2OkKXpEFgD9x9Djp1dn4TEez.jpg","credit_id":"67fffaa8c77fd1df74acfcf9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135567,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Markham","original_name":"Nigel Markham","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/qkj2OkKXpEFgD9x9Djp1dn4TEez.jpg","credit_id":"67fffab02c85e796639938dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050700,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angela Baker","original_name":"Angela Baker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fffabcc77fd1df74acfd03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135567,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Markham","original_name":"Nigel Markham","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/qkj2OkKXpEFgD9x9Djp1dn4TEez.jpg","credit_id":"67fffac3aacf7cfb2699f6e8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary Sexton","original_name":"Mary Sexton","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fffacac77fd1df74acfd07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32484006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
