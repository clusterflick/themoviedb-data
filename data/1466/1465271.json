The daily life of the space and the ramblings of the charismatic friar and artist Celso Bordignon are interspersed in an attempt to contemplate aspects of religious life, art, and the awareness of the nuances of the action of time on matter, body and spirit.","popularity":0.4219,"poster_path":"/tjMSGKxPJwTyRJVO3vJ2UyH1EZ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":259623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manifesto Kinomobile","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celso: a portrait, a place","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Celso: A portrait, A place","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5376914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celso Bordignon","original_name":"Celso Bordignon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kVZ4weZt0kLlUxp7kma9s93LJMI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"As himself","credit_id":"680006c6d645e41e099978b0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5376906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maikel de Abreu","original_name":"Maikel de Abreu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cVR919f8SfBFNRWQpmTSv9SBtzZ.jpg","credit_id":"68000614ef5ae687cbd9b2fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5376909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur Della Giustina","original_name":"Arthur Della Giustina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68000630d645e41e09997880","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5376906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maikel de Abreu","original_name":"Maikel de Abreu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cVR919f8SfBFNRWQpmTSv9SBtzZ.jpg","credit_id":"680066bcd645e41e09998c77","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5376906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maikel de Abreu","original_name":"Maikel de Abreu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cVR919f8SfBFNRWQpmTSv9SBtzZ.jpg","credit_id":"680066d2f39c730125d93af5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenstory"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5377552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Balbinot","original_name":"Carlos Balbinot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6800671bef5ae687cbd9bf40","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5377553,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Balbinot","original_name":"Carlos Balbinot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6800672261b1c4bb3299ccc8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trent Reznor","original_name":"Trent Reznor","popularity":0.2682,"profile_path":"/v6DcTfFqFTFaR8gqMK6sOODKS0T.jpg","credit_id":"680067362c85e79663994b7d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1929,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A39tkHfGXOIgmLNV1U9fNzsp2wU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3430}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/tjMSGKxPJwTyRJVO3vJ2UyH1EZ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10706,"name":"spirituality"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":279389,"name":"brazilian cinema"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":350415,"name":"maikel de abreu"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
