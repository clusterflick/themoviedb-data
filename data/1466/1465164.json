On his way to a tropical, solo, drug-filled getaway, he is kidnapped, and wakes up in a room with a shock collar on. A voice over a loudspeaker explains that he can only take 50 steps every 24 hours, or he will be punished. He embarks on a journey where he must adapt his lifestyle, and conserve every step, in order to adhere to his captorâ€™s demands. As this dark comedy unfolds, Tanner is forced to confront his own demons, and ultimately decide what matters more... attaining a bunch of trivial steps that no one in the world cares about, or not being a pile of human garbage.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crescent Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Williams","original_name":"Evan Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tanner Slade","credit_id":"67fed6efc1e0a708cbad760b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Cueva","original_name":"Vincent Cueva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Janitor","credit_id":"67fed6fac1e0a708cbad761a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jhanelle Dennis","original_name":"Jhanelle Dennis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Woman On Street","credit_id":"67fed706c1e0a708cbad7625","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3009041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Duncanson","original_name":"Peter Duncanson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/tFsSn6phQUTv6GoWnGCx206Txth.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Boss","credit_id":"67fed71cd645e41e09993ab3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Goodwin","original_name":"Dylan Goodwin","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Salad Shop Employee","credit_id":"67fed745d645e41e09993ac6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1841576,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Bricker","original_name":"Dan Bricker","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed75ed645e41e09993acd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eytan Millstone","original_name":"Eytan Millstone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed77f61b1c4bb329989c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Bricker","original_name":"Dan Bricker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed78ad8b85eb782d9422d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eytan Millstone","original_name":"Eytan Millstone","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed793437f0b80eead5128","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735500,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Wiseman","original_name":"Bob Wiseman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed7ab3110bd82dfad91ec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375271,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Peterson","original_name":"Alex Peterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed7c93110bd82dfad9209","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Bricker","original_name":"Dan Bricker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed7d6437f0b80eead514a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953227,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eytan Millstone","original_name":"Eytan Millstone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fed7e09d1f778ab899900c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4029993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"R.J.
