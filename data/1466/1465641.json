Among the new, suggested solutions is co-management: a system in which gorvernments devolve some of the authority for managing fish stocks to local communities. One of the best-known and most successful examples of co-management is found in Norway's Lofoten Islands, where a tradition of self-regulation is backed up by a national commitment to supporting scientific fisheries research. What lessons can be drawn from the Lofoten experience? This film will encourage fishing communities to see that there are alternatives, however imperfect, to the current global fisheries crisis.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Norway's Lofoten Cod Fishery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5376836,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dave Quinton","original_name":"Dave Quinton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"67fffb79c77fd1df74acfd9e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5376836,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dave Quinton","original_name":"Dave Quinton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fffba1f39c730125d92914","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135567,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Markham","original_name":"Nigel Markham","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/qkj2OkKXpEFgD9x9Djp1dn4TEez.jpg","credit_id":"67fffba9aacf7cfb2699f733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135567,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Markham","original_name":"Nigel Markham","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/qkj2OkKXpEFgD9x9Djp1dn4TEez.jpg","credit_id":"67fffbaef39c730125d92918","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2050701,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Mahoney","original_name":"Mike Mahoney","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/rXqbi3dmu8WUaok0MtprmqwmsD8.jpg","credit_id":"67fffbbe83c6e567c7d956b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marilyn A.
