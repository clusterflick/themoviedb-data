The husband turns on the TV and channel-surfs between commercials as his wife, clearly exhausted, settles into a deep sleep. Each commercial the husband views is more sensual than the last and, in short order, he's horny. He tries to stir his wife, but she's not having it. Through a series of fantasies and flashbacks, A Bedtime Story offers a humorous glimpse into the minds of the couple as they try (again and again) to achieve their conflicting goals. Compromise was seldom this inventive.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":259633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Memory Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's tired.
