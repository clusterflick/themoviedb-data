Or rather – how do our animal companions think? How can we imagine the lives of our (non-human) animal friends? In this video essay, Lily Dog looks at Derrida’s writings and makes a case about how human and non-human understand each other – or not – based on her own life and adventures. Jacques Derrida was interested in animal consciousness and animal subjectivity, and he wrote about them both in The Animal That Therefore I Am – a text that Lily Dog quotes and speaks to in the video.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A video essay made in collaboration with Lily Dog about companion animal relations, and interspecies communication.","title":"Lily Does Derrida: A Dog’s Video Essay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Thorson","original_name":"Josh Thorson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voice Over","credit_id":"67ff8de77c29ae5bc3d9d841","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1751206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathy High","original_name":"Kathy High","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/teaXdySOFJJU3PRb4VZAGoCmT0v.jpg","credit_id":"67ff8d28c77fd1df74ace290","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1751206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathy High","original_name":"Kathy High","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/teaXdySOFJJU3PRb4VZAGoCmT0v.jpg","credit_id":"67ff8e22de5e4dec62aea602","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":308458,"name":"video essay"},{"id":350394,"name":"derrida"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
