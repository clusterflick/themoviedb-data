While this very short work was inspired by Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s painting The Two Sisters (On the Terrace,) the film is not so much narrative driven as much as it is an exercise in atmosphere. Features voiceover by Italian cinema veteran Silvia Collatina (Lucio Fulci’s House by the Cemetery, Sergio Martino’s The Great Alligator.) A secondary purpose of the film is to document the largely forgotten (and empty) Bickley Crypt in Bensalem, PA.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/opeuExDv5lkSNIsRO2SzaHpr8mV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Ragazza Con Il Cappello Rosso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32192620","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opeuExDv5lkSNIsRO2SzaHpr8mV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
