One day, the two of them joined five others who were going to the cabaret Kurofune in Shimoda and went on a journey together, where they discovered a pretty young woman named Keiko, called Lilu. When the group returned to Tokyo, Keiko, who wanted to be a singer, followed them and asked them to accompany her to Tokyo. Keiko settled on the second floor of Tetsuo's aunt's tobacco shop in Tokyo, but Sanada went on a journey as a musician with the female swordsman Oe Midori's troupe to take care of Keiko's immediate living expenses. During his absence, Keiko was able to make her debut as a radio singer thanks to the kindness of Tetsuo's friend. Hearing Keiko's voice coming from the radio, Sanada rejected Midori's advances and returned to Tokyo.","popularity":0.1418,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1952-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"風の噂のリル","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michitarō Mizushima","original_name":"水島道太郎","popularity":0.4033,"profile_path":"/tZF69ab1laEx77uaT2oXQhJ0U5U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67feada383c6e567c7d90d3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1133130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriko Hamada","original_name":"浜田百合子","popularity":0.1999,"profile_path":"/7BvTzTYaw1dNAlgBzKdmlPdCndL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67feada87c29ae5bc3d9b566","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akihiko Katayama","original_name":"片山明彦","popularity":0.4244,"profile_path":"/9wkITj5qUYcOhWTVdhs4c4g57xv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67feadb1c1e0a708cbad6efd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1269533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sumiko Minami","original_name":"南寿美子","popularity":0.3869,"profile_path":"/f9iJ3SaaNmsc0Zxbv8kQO5wtGMH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67feadbd9d1f778ab899857d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1529923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yōnosuke Toba","original_name":"鳥羽陽之助","popularity":0.1742,"profile_path":"/xdAqbcXDzgeBFTeXX6HaG1hJZdb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67feadc57c29ae5bc3d9b57b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":992934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koji Shima","original_name":"島耕二","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/7MTEH0RV11BNb73MMuylvMCTU5b.jpg","credit_id":"67fead449d1f778ab899853f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1952-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
