In 1927 the \"all-Union elder\" Mikhail Kalinin came here to establish the Jewish national district. To honor this event the inhabitants of Velyka Seidemynukha renamed their village to Kalinindorf. Today Kalinindorf has a neutral name Kalynivske. Only ruins of the ancient synagogue remind us of Jewish collective farms. As well as the director of the local museum, who keeps preserving the history of these lands.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rS9iNALFGUTD5ErCPVuxP0dC32l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalinindorf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Kasyanov","original_name":"Les Kasyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8cb87c29ae5bc3d9d790","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Kasyanov","original_name":"Les Kasyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8cc4c77fd1df74ace25f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Kasyanov","original_name":"Les Kasyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8cd183c6e567c7d93390","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Kasyanov","original_name":"Les Kasyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8cdf7c29ae5bc3d9d7c5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Kasyanov","original_name":"Les Kasyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8cebc77fd1df74ace27a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yurii Kaparulin","original_name":"Yurii Kaparulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8cfe2c85e796639919b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yurii Kaparulin","original_name":"Yurii Kaparulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8d0a83c6e567c7d9339f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yurii Kaparulin","original_name":"Yurii Kaparulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff8d187c29ae5bc3d9d7ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36588386","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"kalinindorf","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rS9iNALFGUTD5ErCPVuxP0dC32l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fiorenzo Serra Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Калініндорф (трейлер)","key":"7sGqNJdHrwQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-20T21:16:09.000Z","id":"67ff8c6b7c29ae5bc3d9d745"}]}}}
