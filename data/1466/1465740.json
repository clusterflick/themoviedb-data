Thirty-six years ago documentary film-maker Richard Taylor was serving as a military police subaltern in Korea. Near to his tent they were interrogating prisoners - and sometimes they tortured them. That was the start of a lifelong concern about torture. Is it simply something which happens under military dictatorships and communist regimes - or is it closer to ourselves than we like to think? This investigation is not a catalogue of horrors. It asks in a more profound sense what torture does to its victims, and what turns ordinary human beings into torturers. Prompted by a disturbing encounter with a former interrogator from El Salvador 's notorious Treasury Police, he follows a trail that leads to a hard, new world where terrorism, counter-insurgency and torture meet.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/79RW5qNTqBgTfTMuyOi4Q9q2VF1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unleashing of Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/79RW5qNTqBgTfTMuyOi4Q9q2VF1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
