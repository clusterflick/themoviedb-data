Growing up feeling different and disconnected, she navigates a world where she never quite fit in, leading her to rebel and self-medicate through drugs. Her brushes with the law, incarceration and episodes of attempted suicide reveal a profound sense of isolation and desperation. She discovers a path to mental well being through therapy, ultimately finding empowerment in music and a renewed sense of purpose. This powerful visual account highlights the importance of self-acceptance, resilience, and the ongoing battle against the stigma surrounding mental health, reminding us that while life may be imperfect, it is a shared human experience worth embracing.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1 in 5: A Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5374908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Gato","original_name":"Paul Gato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67feb39561b1c4bb329981c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
