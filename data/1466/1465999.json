Many locals volunteer, including Jose, an 18-year-old raising himself and his younger sister, Mercedes. The miners go down but succumb to an evil force deep within the mine, disappearing from the face of the Earth. The town quickly gives up hope, but Mercedes takes it upon herself to find her brother and the missing gold, no matter the costs. She'll have to take on the tycoon and perhaps even the Devil himself, but she will find out what happened deep down in The Devil's Vein.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/qvwKtDkSRwYIcalhvnwGFvcO8Wb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Formidable Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":259673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucy Animation Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Vein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Acuña","original_name":"Germán Acuña","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/AcuDzz2MxEZd4X5PxJLYYKsocVM.jpg","credit_id":"6800d55de506a8e3a0ace5ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646735,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juan Pablo Sepúlveda","original_name":"Juan Pablo Sepúlveda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6800d56af39c730125d955a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77KgB3gMJPOvCclGf1VFJmCdjX8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mE15z3mNa9uhU7MIKYy31DUxBhe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1801}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":996,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/qvwKtDkSRwYIcalhvnwGFvcO8Wb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
