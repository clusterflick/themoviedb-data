But when his younger brother is killed in a mysterious hit that reeks of police and cartel collusion, Eric is forced to tap into his old instincts. He uncovers a deep web of corruption linking city officials, a powerful drug ring, and a shadowy Aztec relic smuggling operation. Guided by his uncle’s teachings about the ancient Jaguar warriors — elite Aztec protectors — Eric must walk the fine line between justice and vengeance. Armed with street smarts, ancestral wisdom, and a burning sense of purpose, he transforms from hunted man into mythic vigilante.","popularity":0.5936,"poster_path":"/1DC1n1KYFy8rtuYlBMuNXOf13Zr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5106,"logo_path":"/UjER6i4eM9WuBCVxSSWFtMrsuT.png","name":"Copperheart Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":177485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hill District Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Montez: Rise of the Jaguar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5375740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Montez","original_name":"Eric Montez","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eric Montez","credit_id":"67ff4092c1e0a708cbad8229","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Duarte","original_name":"Camila Duarte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Isabela Reyes","credit_id":"67ff40a5c1e0a708cbad8239","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristian Robledo","original_name":"Cristian Robledo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Detective Leon Vargas","credit_id":"67ff40b9c1e0a708cbad8250","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esteban Aguilar","original_name":"Esteban Aguilar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tío Mateo","credit_id":"67ff40d87c29ae5bc3d9cc6f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Mateo Serrano","original_name":"Luis Mateo Serrano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rico \"Spade\" Alvarez","credit_id":"67ff40e47c29ae5bc3d9cc7f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Vela","original_name":"Julian Vela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Miguel Montez","credit_id":"67ff4102d8b85eb782d9512c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Paula Ríos","original_name":"Ana Paula Ríos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marisol “Mari” Castillo","credit_id":"67ff4115d8b85eb782d95137","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas M.
