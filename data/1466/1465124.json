The dispute that began with an ethics question over a single biology paper caught the attention of the national media and US congress, and had lasting repercussions on how scientific misconduct cases are investigated even 40 years later.  17 Pages reconstructs the historical events through archival news coverage, congressional testimony, and first-hand interviews. The series is particularly focused on the role of bias in this story, how preconceived notions can affect an audienceâ€™s view on a complex web of testimony and evidence.","popularity":0.1717,"poster_path":"/4vfnMcj5nOMP3uZ1GHHwm0wFhHn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"The true story of something something","title":"17 Pages","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375003,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevan MacKay","original_name":"Kevan MacKay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fec1f2437f0b80eead4b63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5375003,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevan MacKay","original_name":"Kevan MacKay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fec1ff437f0b80eead4b66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31843022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4vfnMcj5nOMP3uZ1GHHwm0wFhHn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/neshQKhqfLGRnOJoCYMw6YPOibQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I made a movie (and this is a trailer for it)","key":"JKaMVhr1g9s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-15T15:03:33.000Z","id":"67fec26b3110bd82dfad8c30"}]}}}
