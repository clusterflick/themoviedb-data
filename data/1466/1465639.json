Starring Ryan Capizzi (THE THOUSAND STEPS,) the film notably features an original score by maestro Carlo Maria Cordio (Fulci’s AENIGMA, D’Amato’s ABSURD, Fragasso’s TROLL 2, etc.) There is also minor participation from Wayne Camp (D’Amato’s DEEP BLOOD, WAR BABY, etc.) for an added touch of authenticity. One can expect a mysterious, twisting tale in Fulci-style about a marina owner and a steamboat explosion.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s9Ee4zhXK7Iq2upkyeWZyheMWjh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The City Of Dunwich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Milewski","original_name":"Chris Milewski","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fffb3ac77fd1df74acfd50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Milewski","original_name":"Chris Milewski","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fffb4683c6e567c7d9568d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28769555","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s9Ee4zhXK7Iq2upkyeWZyheMWjh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
