This film explores their unique experience of navigation.  The color grading oscillating between blue and red, creates a visual language that moves away from usual conventions, evoking their inner resonances.  The soundtrack, composed by Meryll Ampe, combines sounds recorded at sea with repetitive music. This colorimetric and sound treatment creates an atmosphere inviting to feel the nuances of perception at sea.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mer intérieure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4773728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giulia Grossmann","original_name":"Giulia Grossmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff3fdd7c29ae5bc3d9cc37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063307,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Méryll Ampe","original_name":"Méryll Ampe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ff3ffbd645e41e099945c4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
