Rimbaud was always one of Nolan’s heroes. Over the years he painted many pictures of the poet. The famous artist responded enthusiastically to a suggestion by an Australian scriptwriter for a film about Rimbaud and he produced 31 large new paintings for this film together with many small crayon drawings.  These works, interwoven with a wealth of drawings paintings, photographs and documents from the Louvre, the French National Library and the Rimbaud Museum at Charleville, have been combined in a filmic evocation of one of France’s most extraordinary writers.","popularity":0.2398,"poster_path":"/mbiH3dcj47QCsiUeEFJCknafNso.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Is of Eden I Was Dreaming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Caldwell","original_name":"Zoe Caldwell","popularity":0.2498,"profile_path":"/vukuSt1kVgGC8sTOU44BUrqiLhN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5982ef729251413d0e00b3d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Nolan","original_name":"Sidney Nolan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5982ef7fc3a3682f7800a8ee","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829366,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Muir","original_name":"David Muir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5982ef48925141433000b16f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6035490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1180,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mbiH3dcj47QCsiUeEFJCknafNso.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
