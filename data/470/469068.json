When lost in his own world, he is often oblivious to what the present demands from him.  Raja, his close friend shares Tapu's interests but not with the same intensity. Raja's father disapproves of Raja and Tapu's friendship and decides to send his son to a town school for better education. Shantu, a so called mentally challenged person, gradually starts to share a special bond with Tapu after Raja leaves.  Raja, on the other hand, feels crippled and isolated in his new surrounding and his growing impatience forces his father to bring him back home. As fate would have it, their friendship soars high and gets set to touch a new horizon.","popularity":0.0497,"poster_path":"/je3qQTUZPsSsj9fVqrN6EyATOGa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pakaram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soham Moitra","original_name":"Soham Moitra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5980ef22c3a3680cc8003a80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ritesh Biswas","original_name":"Ritesh Biswas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5980ef2f925141519b003476","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lama Halder","original_name":"Lama Halder","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/23O53MFw6UrdPVbFWq1jeHy35Fv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"641ec39954a8ac00b5a854b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1862235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sankar Debnath","original_name":"Sankar Debnath","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":"/pba1XutC8uFgaqLaT0R9o2hLlzb.jpg","credit_id":"5980ef4492514151ed003312","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":1337,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/je3qQTUZPsSsj9fVqrN6EyATOGa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
