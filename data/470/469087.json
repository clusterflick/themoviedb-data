I spliced them together and put them aside. At the same time I was experimenting with sound loops, inspired by John Lilly's work with dolphin language. Briefly, he discovered that when exposed to a repeating loop in a relaxed atmosphere, a subject would begin to hear sounds or words other than those recorded. I made some loops and found that the phrase \"the struggle of the meat\" was a particularly evocative one.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/6O3ZLVADnvNqawJcn1OB3ExDTv4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Struggle of the Meat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Anne Parker Severson","original_name":"Alice Anne Parker Severson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59812a45c3a3680cfb007474","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0230823","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6O3ZLVADnvNqawJcn1OB3ExDTv4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
