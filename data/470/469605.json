It is here that one recalls Kogan's admiration of Lyalya's emotional documentary skills. And it is here that one recalls Kosakovsky's depiction of Lyalya as a person of extraordinarily prosperous feelings, sensitive and energetic, childish and female, shrill and quiet. The young poets are marvellously sneaky, respectfully adoring and creatively playing with - maybe even deconstructing - \"Aleksandr Sergeevich\", Mr. Pushkin, Russia's exclusive trade mark of high culture and literature.","popularity":0.0584,"poster_path":"/cd4j0wZjlf1DMvBSXXD3NKRkmcM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89930,"logo_path":"/ncWu4Fo1g4i5BRqnwATTKWm56bQ.png","name":"Leningrad Documentary Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Very Personal Poetry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Svoi sovsem osobyye stikhi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477885,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vyacheslav Leykin","original_name":"Vyacheslav Leykin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/uE5X18hjQ0WWBHU6QSH9jHOcbWL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5985f13f9251413d5300039c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1864165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyudmila Anishchenko","original_name":"Lyudmila Anishchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5985f1589251413d530003c3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1864164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyudmila Stanukinas","original_name":"Людмила Станукинас","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/uUGSmHr9v3RfrUGRIdbb5R9sSpH.jpg","credit_id":"5985f09b9251413d2b00031c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1588293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Kogan","original_name":"Pavel Kogan","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/6HfcekWN17uPxhB53xDRAMs0U0c.jpg","credit_id":"5985f0d7c3a368320e000350","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9516330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cd4j0wZjlf1DMvBSXXD3NKRkmcM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
