As the West begins to influence China in the late 19th century, the dynamics within the city shift dramatically. The film highlights the preservation and restoration of invaluable treasures and paintings, culminating in the creation of the Palace Museum. With insights from renowned China scholar, Jonathan Spence, this is an intimate exploration of the rich cultural and historical tapestry that makes up the heart of ancient China.","popularity":0.5754,"poster_path":"/xgNXt0u27I8Sx1SbzBYbfXt0uKo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden City: The Great Within","video":true,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Discovery Forbidden City: The Great Within","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Forbidden City: The Great Within","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Steiger","original_name":"Rod Steiger","popularity":0.9423,"profile_path":"/brIyEn13q7IQr0MoNcU529roNbr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"652d5787024ec80101531829","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4323407,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"May Holdsworth","original_name":"May Holdsworth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652d5879a80236011ac6e704","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058347,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Cowling","original_name":"Tim Cowling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59869b7c9251413cfc00e7fd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Geffen","original_name":"Anthony Geffen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59869b98c3a3680d5100646f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1864449,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Moyer","original_name":"Greg Moyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59869bb59251413d5d00e728","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0403045","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9SOCaeTNBzRWgJLJL0ws5Wl9lb2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.737,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xgNXt0u27I8Sx1SbzBYbfXt0uKo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1179},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":799,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/jdxlfaiucXp1qQxqgWVQhsf4Wfw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":478,"name":"china"},{"id":230006,"name":"forbidden city"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":300324,"name":"chinese documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
