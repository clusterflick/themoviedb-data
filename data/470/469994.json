Yet because of his numerous transformations, his face never became as iconic as that of, say, Boris Karloff. Accompanied by a soundtrack from Bernhard Lang, this “re-imagination of shots” taken from Chaney´s forty-six surviving films offers a beguiling excursion into the history of film. The director reveals surprising associations, while highlighting the enduring magic of works which are now more or less forgotten.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Messenger from the Shadows (Notes on Film 06 A/Monologue 01)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Chaney","original_name":"Lon Chaney","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/m1icBooBEqFNp24Puu7qXn2Sarr.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"598991469251414bd10116b4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Pfaffenbichler","original_name":"Norbert Pfaffenbichler","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/5IMSPMNujEow6xaHWr1uiN8WQ9k.jpg","credit_id":"59899153c3a3681f6e011ee0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Pfaffenbichler","original_name":"Norbert Pfaffenbichler","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/5IMSPMNujEow6xaHWr1uiN8WQ9k.jpg","credit_id":"5989915d9251413706004b24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3138070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" ","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
