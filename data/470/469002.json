First produced by the Vienna Opera in February 1892, \"Werther\" rapidly confirmed Massanet's position on the French opera scene and achieved enormous popularity outside France, notably in Italy, America and England. The tragic story tells of Werther's intense passion for Charlotte, who has married his best friend, Albert, fulfilling a pledge to her now deceased mother. But Werther's letters of love bring Charlotte to his side when he promises to take his own life.","popularity":0.2323,"poster_path":"/7KomdylLlZzniTgcxGQ8972NCV9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28449,"logo_path":"/mDjPjvkTpRywYMGcuNReCe4xWbG.png","name":"Československá televízia Bratislava","origin_country":"XC"},{"id":73466,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV 2000 Film und Fernsehproduktions","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Werther","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Fassbaender","original_name":"Brigitte Fassbaender","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"5980940f9251414929012910","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Dvorský","original_name":"Peter Dvorský","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/uQIQIlScmPQvi9iPODAPABfuVqM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Werther","credit_id":"5ddc4ef04284ea0014f917c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magda Vášáryová","original_name":"Magda Vášáryová","popularity":0.1841,"profile_path":"/aDNEiVISpQi4rqimk1Lp7mvlGQb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5ddc4f1a3faba00019011c4a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdaléna Hajóssyová","original_name":"Magdaléna Hajóssyová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5ddc4f243faba00015010748","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Helm","original_name":"Hans Helm","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"5ddc4f43aad9c20018c2e0f5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michal Dočolomanský","original_name":"Michal Dočolomanský","popularity":0.2604,"profile_path":"/2kATI6ldzJLwflyHKMfbrLPI1u4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"5ddc4f54a806730014120ee9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2467631,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Libor Pešek","original_name":"Libor Pešek","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5ddc4f794f58010012f759e9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Weigl","original_name":"Petr Weigl","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/3uGqinWlbpwmBjMiLwym6Xwbgwr.jpg","credit_id":"5980941bc3a3681055013218","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926508,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Milliet","original_name":"Paul Milliet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddc4fe64f58010016f75807","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467632,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eduard Blau","original_name":"Eduard Blau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddc4fd0cdf2e600173b1de3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1344029","wikidata_id":"Q15270513","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7KomdylLlZzniTgcxGQ8972NCV9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5tHVHeUlE2MuQKiZPPN3IbhaStQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1985-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
