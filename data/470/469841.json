They are fearless and lethal, even going so far as to kill an undercover cop to humiliate the police. However, internal strife is brewing among the team. Three of its members plot to get rid of the leader, dissatisfied that his share of the loot seems disproportionate. The questions remain: will this faction of the gang overcome their leader, and could this gang of strong-minded thieves hold up without him?","popularity":0.5122,"poster_path":"/bMSVsQnk3NzhIsdQW3FsLwcbBSl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sam Po Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2002-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Partners","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Heng hang ba dao","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bad Guys","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Bad Guys","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Tsang Chi-Wai","original_name":"曾志偉","popularity":1.0747,"profile_path":"/vrPBadugqlMkfNIYzLZbP4sEF1j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Foon Chan","credit_id":"5b1d89a5c3a3680895003520","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Yam","original_name":"任達華","popularity":1.0227,"profile_path":"/5Jss5TaxVWofhD5UYaVmPTw7vl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kwan Yeung","credit_id":"5b1d89ba0e0a264faf002fb5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wong","original_name":"王敏德","popularity":0.6932,"profile_path":"/k3iH4zPZ8faWEF5uJeiq7fTtg7p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rick","credit_id":"5b1d89fbc3a3680883002b49","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chapman To Man-Chat","original_name":"杜汶澤","popularity":0.5856,"profile_path":"/xkgw8jyF4JFX2LANQ8kJKwUmq4A.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lee Tin Wah","credit_id":"5b1d8a26c3a368089f002d62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Yip Wing-Cho","original_name":"叶荣祖","popularity":0.4797,"profile_path":"/tfJWAnUqq312lO64fEP7jVP8MPl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ece9fffe61e6d001dcb69b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Mok","original_name":"莫家堯","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/mqxT6ZeRwleXsfsk44pA1a28uDf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65fe58597f6c8d01636e68f1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281882,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edmond Fung Yuen-Man","original_name":"馮遠文","popularity":0.1541,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c0840c52301b3574c20357","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Wong Ngai-Lun","original_name":"Alan Wong Ngai-Lun","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c083f2614bbfcb8a9dc46c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Billy Chan Wui-Ngai","original_name":"陳會毅","popularity":0.2981,"profile_path":"/pkcpIWjzE9UgqBQQL7RarP5pbN2.jpg","credit_id":"5ece9fc921c4ca0021dbdd4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0339496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zpae9jdI7CwQn6z8nu46dzkpOy7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/bMSVsQnk3NzhIsdQW3FsLwcbBSl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10051,"name":"heist"},{"id":10726,"name":"gang"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
