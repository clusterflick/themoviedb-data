During the 1960s a million acres a year were opened up. Much of the land was unsuitable for farming yet the new landholders were obliged to bulldoze and burn the native bush or risk losing their allocation. Most were eager to do so and pressured the government to release even more land. The long-term consequences have been devastating, with industrial farming and salinity turning most of this priceless natural heritage into a biological desert.","popularity":0.0722,"poster_path":"/dnl61bjYsWbqvZWE1FtQk0XGSEW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Million Acres a Year","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Rijavec","original_name":"Frank Rijavec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5983067dc3a368327900c31f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4109136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":987,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dnl61bjYsWbqvZWE1FtQk0XGSEW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
