Ancestral beings, the Lightning Brothers, feature in this art. For the Wardaman people, the Lightning Brothers are an important part of their living culture. The Wardaman perform traditional songs and ceremonies associated with special Dreamtime places where their art is found. Like many rock art sites, the Wardaman's Dreamtime places are extremely vulnerable. This fascinating and educational program, featuring the music of Australian group Gondwanaland, looks at the way these valuable sites are being preserved.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/xYxMGWWQa3YWDgeJRzqSlLI6OHo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land of the Lightning Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Roberts","original_name":"David Roberts","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5981bac1c3a3680d32013a6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1128,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xYxMGWWQa3YWDgeJRzqSlLI6OHo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
