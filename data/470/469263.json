Their first sale is their last, when a burly customer realizes he's been had. Next stop, Joe, Knobby and Punchy load up at a local diner, and Knobby has a scheme to skip out on the bill. Of course, the diner owner turns out to be their watch customer, and the boys make a hasty exit with the manager's waitress girlfriend in tow.  Knobby books Palooka into a local vaudeville house to put on some exhibition bouts. Of course, their friend from the diner is in the audience, with a bag of rotten tomatoes, and he's more than willing to come on stage when Knobby asks for a volunteer to box with Joe.","popularity":0.3188,"poster_path":"/s2Nnr445h7X9fRQBsaFxDKdzK0K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9329,"logo_path":"/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png","name":"The Vitaphone Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blonde Bomber","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1862839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Norton","original_name":"Robert Norton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Joe Palooka","credit_id":"5982fc0992514141b300c14f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shemp Howard","original_name":"Shemp Howard","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/b6L3kV2qnputHSsd7uYirjKEMBC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Knobby Walsh","credit_id":"5982fc25c3a368349000c6b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Weber","original_name":"Lee Weber","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Punchy","credit_id":"5982fc38925141421200c209","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Gribbon","original_name":"Harry Gribbon","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/mCb7YfHqL8uwcU0vlFo7VlPohtp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Diner Manager","credit_id":"5982fc4d9251413d0e00c3d5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Berkes","original_name":"John Berkes","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/pp2OCgDrAnHqal9jLZcxgtmc3UX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Johnnie","credit_id":"5982fc5f925141433c00bdbd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Doran","original_name":"Mary Doran","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/rlQAwYe3kWCsqNkfC8mKLlp830S.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marcy","credit_id":"5982fc70c3a36833f100b860","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd French","original_name":"Lloyd French","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/1OxZbBlJrHK7QVy9NLVMdrWVEsQ.jpg","credit_id":"5982fc859251413d0e00c439","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ham Fisher","original_name":"Ham Fisher","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5982fc96c3a368327900b6da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0381058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s2Nnr445h7X9fRQBsaFxDKdzK0K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
