He moved to Chicago in 1919, and there he became a notable criminal figure and gangster. He played large parts in gambling, alcohol, and prostitution rackets. In 1925, after an assassination attempt on former head Johnny Torrio, Capone took control of the Chicago Outfit, of which he had served as the second in command. He was listed on the FBI's \"Most Wanted\" list, sold alcohol during the Prohibition era, planned the St. Valentine's Day massacre, and was eventually indicted and convicted of income tax evasion in 1931.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/69xyu4mF4FU0M9FJ6MBOnTkSMkX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discovery: Al Capone's Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Discovery: Al Capone's Chicago","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Al Capone's Chicago","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0839610","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7p94xPlWRl8MH8pqhue8NkZlgMC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/69xyu4mF4FU0M9FJ6MBOnTkSMkX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
