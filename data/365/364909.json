His wife is cheating on him, his partner Losfeld has betrayed him and his company is on the verge of bankruptcy. Deeply depressed and desperate, he rents a hotel room on the 32nd floor. He writes a farewell letter to his wife and opens the window to jump into the depths. A young woman is standing on the window sill next door, apparently up to the same thing. With the promise to spend the last evening of the year with her, he manages to save her and himself for the time being. This is the beginning of a strange, romantic, comical story that takes place on a single New Year's Eve and in which two people change their lives","popularity":0.3755,"poster_path":"/gHkZ9KjUFscgrlxTevzAofq03Zn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picknick im Schnee","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Habich","original_name":"Matthias Habich","popularity":0.1959,"profile_path":"/dzrlyzf3yxOTibLLBEbawytMDKs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Johannes Breutigam","credit_id":"5628feebc3a368488c002226","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Schoras","original_name":"Chiara Schoras","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/dSv6J5w0SD2P84Tv2xwQ2mdKQHt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frankie","credit_id":"5628fefbc3a3684887001ec5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Auer","original_name":"Barbara Auer","popularity":0.5055,"profile_path":"/6luVLipGUCnjEJ6x0UKEqGByJOD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Claudia Breutigam","credit_id":"5628ff299251414ccf0021c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Düwel","original_name":"Karin Düwel","popularity":0.2461,"profile_path":"/6aveylkRKfl2qT7w7lliU3WEQTP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Taxifahrerin","credit_id":"5628ff389251414cdb002019","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Dissel","original_name":"Werner Dissel","popularity":0.3012,"profile_path":"/uxe94Y4wjEAHpJYGaMYx4MwAIo9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mann mit Decke","credit_id":"5628ff46c3a36848800020ac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Kind","original_name":"Michael Kind","popularity":0.5302,"profile_path":"/pGP1CV07GBO117n0aMFpeU8zO6S.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Zivilfahnder Olaf Becker","credit_id":"5628ff55c3a368487d0020b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter von Strombeck","original_name":"Peter von Strombeck","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Menken","credit_id":"5a8e04370e0a263e71007683","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henriette Gonnermann","original_name":"Henriette Gonnermann","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mitarbeiterin von Johannes","credit_id":"5a8e045a9251416c81006a07","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Nimbach","original_name":"Ruth Nimbach","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/2ckTXwg3tx0VIzyEBkxIsY0PaYD.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5a8e046c0e0a263e74006e0f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomy Wigand","original_name":"Tomy Wigand","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5628feda9251414cdd001ed4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48684,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Rauhaus","original_name":"Martin Rauhaus","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5878d02c9251417864007bf6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0183651","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yvt3WpYA9Q46rhK8oBV08ps9hjd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHkZ9KjUFscgrlxTevzAofq03Zn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
