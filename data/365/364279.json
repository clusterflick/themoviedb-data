Peterson (33-3-1, 17 KO) is coming off of a debated loss to Danny Garcia in April, while Diaz (17-0, 8 KO) fought on the undercard that night, beating Gabriel Bracero in a ten-round decision. Diaz, 31, has really not stood out as a pro after winning gold in Beijing for the Dominican Republic, but he's got talent and might be someone who just needs a fight to get up for, and this is easily his biggest shot to date.  In the co-feature, we'll see two undefeated, tall welterweight prospects, as six-footers Prichard Colon (16-0, 13 KO) and Terrel Williams (14-0, 12 KO) meet in a 10-round bout, which replaces the canceled Andre Dirrell-Blake Caparello fight on the broadcast.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lamont Peterson vs. Felix Diaz","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
