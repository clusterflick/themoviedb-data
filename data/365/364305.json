In this fictional tribute to Pasin's legacy, what begins as a small boy's over-scheduled, over supervised, boring day with Grandpa turns into a larger-than-life journey, narrowly escaping wild monkeys and battling aliens to save the universe. Through the power of imagination and epic adventure, a boy learns to be a kid, a father learns to be a dad, a grandpa reminds all of us what childhood is all about.","popularity":0.5359,"poster_path":"/wMqhCsSSzByM1WuV7jkyvfhejYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moonbot Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taking Flight","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1523670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asher Blinkoff","original_name":"Asher Blinkoff","popularity":0.2761,"profile_path":"/jMGlMK31z98DOVU9Yh1yruo6Zp8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Tony (voice)","credit_id":"562320cfc3a3680e1000c7f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Rahm","original_name":"Kevin Rahm","popularity":0.6335,"profile_path":"/A8XJ7tzG5zPTzJRllVAGm326WVi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dad (voice)","credit_id":"562320cf92514135b0000d24","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Wise","original_name":"Ray Wise","popularity":1.2505,"profile_path":"/qUGDdBfPkDQYZR46wuNxMO1UM2K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nonno (voice)","credit_id":"562320cfc3a3680e2000dd43","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trish Farnsworth-Smith","original_name":"Trish Farnsworth-Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5623213992514171cd00cac8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":198990,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"W.G.
