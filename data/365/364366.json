The film became expanded into positive and negative to change balances within it; black for perspective, then black to shadow the screen and make paradoxes with the idea of acting, and the act of seeing the screen.  The music sets a mood then turns a space, remembers the positive then silences the flatness of the negative.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8IabvdthJJvVUz3yShxbXZxoWjX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Footsteps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilyn Halford","original_name":"Marilyn Halford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cef5d7dc3a36806821e1032","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilyn Halford","original_name":"Marilyn Halford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562384f892514127d4002743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Raban","original_name":"William Raban","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/4aQQfFizVMjdkkLkhQedcXe4YoA.jpg","credit_id":"5cef5d9d9251416255b841ab","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Raban","original_name":"William Raban","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/4aQQfFizVMjdkkLkhQedcXe4YoA.jpg","credit_id":"5cef5d9592514135b6b83aa5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8IabvdthJJvVUz3yShxbXZxoWjX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
