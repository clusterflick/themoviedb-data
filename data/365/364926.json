We gain a sense of intimacy with them and nature. Suddenly we leave the worries of our scattered lives and begin to remember the primal elements of existence: earth, wind, fire, water, people, and creation. This epiphanic process demands patience and an almost meditative state, but it is so worth the effort – just as a journey a mountain meadow requires some effort in order to find its treasures.  We leave the traditions of narrative for a more open approach to cinema. There are suggestions and onsets of a storyline, but almost everything remains a mystery for our encountering. This is a film that will allow you to observe and exist, without anxiety, without demands, and it allows you a rare glimpse into the life of things.","popularity":0.1871,"poster_path":"/n4zjAk93AcTyRFz1clXvS4tJjvG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Pilz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":224,"logo_path":"/fCv129CE3olInpdEiOWcC5s2YbQ.png","name":"Wega Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1990-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feldberg","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Weekend","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Rauser","original_name":"Thomas Rauser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef6f7df13af5f003550e3e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Martina","original_name":"Maria Martina","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef6f7e6c7176d0039a53272","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Schreiner","original_name":"Peter Schreiner","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617daf9aa3d027008c6e2256","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Schreiner","original_name":"Peter Schreiner","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617dafb6678259008fdbe9de","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Pilz","original_name":"Michael Pilz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/pqAgRCqueTPDi8ck9nh3hKCj2jO.jpg","credit_id":"56294d97c3a3681b4d0002a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Pilz","original_name":"Michael Pilz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/pqAgRCqueTPDi8ck9nh3hKCj2jO.jpg","credit_id":"5ef6f72639a1a600342fb3d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693254,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mario Bräuer","original_name":"Mario Bräuer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef6f73013af5f003455063f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1548013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Reinhold Kaiser","original_name":"Reinhold Kaiser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef6f74ce93e950033b61278","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693257,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wang Dongfeng","original_name":"Wang Dongfeng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef6f7c239a1a600372dbf9f","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6098,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Veit Heiduschka","original_name":"Veit Heiduschka","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/p92hrerESR8UeqacfRrN07mG56z.jpg","credit_id":"5ef6f7ce13af5f003550e3ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762913,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Rene Diamante","original_name":"Rene Diamante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4ec31e41465c0035a8bb03","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0099559","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1048,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/n4zjAk93AcTyRFz1clXvS4tJjvG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":699},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/nzB60fFkDqpVM6nk4bh5VS3ertl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
