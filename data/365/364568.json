One of the twins, Asmah (Mariam), gets lost during a family outing to a night carnival. An old fisherman finds Asmah and adopts her. The other twin, Asiah (also Mariam, in a double role), grows up to be a famed dance hostess. Asmah, on the other hand, lives in the fishing village with her foster father. A chance encounter (love at first sight) in waters off the village leads Asmah to fall in love with Bashir, a wealthy young man from the city. However, they lose touch when Asmah relocates elsewhere to work as a servant. Bashir tries to seek Asmah out, but gets acquainted with the other twin Asiah instead. A case of mistaken identity that eventually leads to tragedy.","popularity":0.0871,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malay Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1950-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twin Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariam Baharom","original_name":"Mariam Baharom","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/9w0nScQQ68EdvNoUG25ksOEe7ie.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"562576209251413ded004673","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.
