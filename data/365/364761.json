The utterly different adolescents not only have to adjust to one another, but also have to confront themselves in exhausting therapy sessions. Yet thanks to the unorthodox psychiatrist Dr. Wolf, the sessions take a turn for the unexpected - and the four experience a Christmas which they will never forget.","popularity":1.0816,"poster_path":"/iNoPOgr0nHjZCE5WEwCGhvqzjet.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65992,"logo_path":"/yHNBmw8iV7MBQJNOva0h1crdXGt.png","name":"Tatami
