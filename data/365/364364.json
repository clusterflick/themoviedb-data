An image on the borders of apprehension, becoming more and more abstract.  The surfer surfs, never surfs anywhere, an image suspended in the light of the projector lamp.  A very quiet and undramatic film, not particularly didactic.  Sound: the first four minutes consists of a fog-horn, used as the basic tone for a chord played on the organ, the rest of the film uses the sound of breakers with a two second pulse and occasional bursts of musical-like sounds.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":"/xoaDWu4OH5dlHeEyEY4Tq5xs7qf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1972-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silver Surfer","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Dunford","original_name":"Mike Dunford","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562383b39251413a74008d5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xoaDWu4OH5dlHeEyEY4Tq5xs7qf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"London Film-Makers' Co-operative","release_date":"1972-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
