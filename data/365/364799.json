Contorting the images into a variety of isomorphic forms, Vasulka creates a literal shape for these memories, developing these shapes as metaphors for the processes of fragmentation, condensation, and inversion, that inevitably contort fact into memory. While much of the raw material for the tape is drawn from World War II and its rehearsals, the Spanish Civil War and the Russian Revolution, The Art of Memory is really an extended meditation seeking to reconcile the blurry, banal photographs of historic figures with the mass destruction they helped engineer.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":"/5ImzD9OfczWe1qPZjKAusWselz4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art of Memory","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Nagrin","original_name":"Daniel Nagrin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea737a1514c4a00268ab15d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2616886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Cross","original_name":"Doris Cross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voices (voice)","credit_id":"5ea738eed38b58001e26f449","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Vasulka","original_name":"Woody Vasulka","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562801cbc3a3680241000044","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5123736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5ImzD9OfczWe1qPZjKAusWselz4.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j0ntUzMGq3EzuVZjb71hhI1gmS5.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jldYLodkTVyrc2OWZFnagkzOy8O.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l58iwj484xyKytc7TSrGsQfB9pI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ApfqUA97V2nPmQm1rt45YDBXUDg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
