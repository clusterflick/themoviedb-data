Ramlee) returns to Singapore after finishing his studies in London and is thrust into a betrothal with the daughter of his father’s benefactor, Salmah. However, Kassim has already met and fallen in love with someone who shares his interest in Persian poetry. She is Rahimah, a flower salesgirl in Singapore. They go on dates to the nursery, and spend time together (dancing) in a paradise-like garden (Alkaff Gardens). Even after Kassim returns to Kuala Lumpur to work in his benefactor’s rubber plantation, he never forsakes Rahimah and has a rendezvous with her in Singapore when the opportunity arises. Together again, they watch movies at the Rex Theatre, and vow to get married. Unfortunately, Kassim’s father insists on him marrying his benefactor’s daughter, Salmah, who is a rich and cultured girl. Kassim decides to fulfil his father’s death wish and marries Salmah. Eventually, fate brings Kassim to reunite with Rahiman again in their twilight years.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/bkYaYmgUzXSU4NWJXcWo7wvh70l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malay Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1952-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Hearted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
