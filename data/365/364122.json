Smith worked on this cinematic transformation of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (1929) for over ten years and considered it his magnum opus. The film was shot from 1970 to 1972 and edited for the next eight years.  The “program” of the film is meticulous, with a complex structure and order. The Weill opera is transformed into a numerological and symbolic system. Images in the film are divided into categories— portraits, animation, symbols and nature— to form the palindrome P.A.S.A.N.A.S.A.P. The film contains invaluable cameos of important avant-garde figures such as Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith, and Jonas Mekas, intercut with installation pieces from Robert Mapplethorpe’s studio, New York City landmarks of the era, and Smith’s visionary animation.","popularity":0.4449,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harry Smith Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No. 18: Mahagonny","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patti Smith","original_name":"Patti Smith","popularity":0.2733,"profile_path":"/yrrJRuLam6oTJEeAIvvxq07eEEv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1545fe92514178c500b7bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Ginsberg","original_name":"Allen Ginsberg","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/w7qQvokS1lp7IRgefiJdALaaiIi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a15460692514178bf00b99c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Lenya","original_name":"Lotte Lenya","popularity":0.2992,"profile_path":"/9exR24k0Be91FOpg054e7EZWAab.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"5a15460fc3a368073300bd49","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a15461692514178bc00bf9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Mapplethorpe","original_name":"Robert Mapplethorpe","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/wTmG0z5gGD4l3tV5H0dPtuju7jN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a15462ac3a368074600b65f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Smith","original_name":"Harry Smith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/cockMGxZmgwBhXbVMUGxpZ9gEZU.jpg","credit_id":"56c48e4c9251416bac0023dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134331,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kurt Weill","original_name":"Kurt Weill","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/dGjnOHvc0ia0qWMMJizHBwouriG.jpg","credit_id":"5a1546a292514178bc00c044","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11630,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bertolt Brecht","original_name":"Bertolt Brecht","popularity":0.2837,"profile_path":"/cFfD5goJjn9fZ5opYbHoSzDBxsZ.jpg","credit_id":"5a15469892514178cb00b90d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0332697","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":239837,"name":"brecht"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
