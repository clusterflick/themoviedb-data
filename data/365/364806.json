His disappearance—which received almost no press—remains unsolved. An innovator in his sport, Rust custom-built bikes for Colorado’s mountain passes, starting a fat-tire revolution and designing gear that transformed the industry.  Salida native Nathan Ward, himself an intrepid mountain biker, set out to tell Rust’s story, tracking the pioneer’s subject through the infancy of the sport to his role in the thriving community that surrounds it today. Ward brings the riveting documentary to life with a unique local perspective and access. By combining interviews, re-enactments, home movies, and archival footage—and even consulting a psychic to communicate with Rust’s sprit—the director/cinematographer attempts to find answers to this mystery full of loose ends and cold trails. -Denver Film Society","popularity":0.2084,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grit and Thistle Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Hall of Fame Mountain Biker Who Disappeared Without a Trace.","title":"The Rider & the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curtis Imrie","original_name":"Curtis Imrie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"56279c1492514112be0020b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathan Ward","original_name":"Nathan Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56279c37c3a368277a002888","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathan Ward","original_name":"Nathan Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56279c3192514112be0020ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525241,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claude DeMoss","original_name":"Claude DeMoss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56279c64c3a368278600256a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathan Ward","original_name":"Nathan Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56279c2ac3a36827830024f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathan Ward","original_name":"Nathan Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56279c42c3a36827880026ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511484,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lyman Smith","original_name":"Lyman Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56279c5392514137c40024e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4502444","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1981,"name":"colorado"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
