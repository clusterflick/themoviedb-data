Art of the Prank is an emotional journey following the evolution of artist Joey Skaggs-a fierce proponent of independent thinking and the man who has turned the media hoax into an art form. With unprecedented access to the man and his archives, the 95-minute documentary interweaves a current unfolding hoax with a look behind-the-scenes at some classic performance pieces (all reported as fact by a wide range of prestigious journalists) plus commentary from co-conspirators and others.","popularity":0.8272,"poster_path":"/k4wX1ORltNYtO2IlMJMPa2qXt0w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
