It takes, as its point of departure, a glass mural on which all three were working, then zeros into each of them. It links them to their physical and mental worlds through cinematic devices like associative sounds, variable light and montage. Compositionally, the visuals aim to link with the styles of each artist, as well as the larger narrative traditions of India.","popularity":0.0595,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1990-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Figures of Thought","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arun Khopkar","original_name":"Arun Khopkar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562797b2c3a36827910025ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231583","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5918,"name":"painting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
