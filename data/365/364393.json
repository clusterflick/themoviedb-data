Among his interviewees are: award-winning Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien; Hong Kong director Alfred Cheung, a witness to the massacre; actress Deanne Ip, whose national consciousness is fired by the event; as well as his own brothers, one who soon migrates from Hong Kong, and the other, already an Australian emigre. Their personal testimonies are pieced together into a mural of the Chinese people united in their horror and outrage.","popularity":0.2129,"poster_path":"/uEroVpt3kLldIJ9NoxXHxbKJfC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunless Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Meiyou taiyang de rizi","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deanie Yip Tak-Han","original_name":"葉德嫻","popularity":0.8689,"profile_path":"/mlMA3DjS3pkTfyHfDzDV63DnRHD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661cb5f36f43ec01875d00cd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143036,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wu Nien-jen","original_name":"吳念真","popularity":0.4438,"profile_path":"/3SKiqE8HQZdhMFVH3jXXFZMbyBc.jpg","credit_id":"5623ebf5c3a3680e1d00f657","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554842,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shu Kei","original_name":"Shu Kei","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":"/8nYkhr7cELR6waMoGAyR5dInozS.jpg","credit_id":"5f8c6eb7cb8028003907299c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554842,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shu Kei","original_name":"Shu Kei","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":"/8nYkhr7cELR6waMoGAyR5dInozS.jpg","credit_id":"5f8c6ebece9e9100364492b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0100717","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uEroVpt3kLldIJ9NoxXHxbKJfC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
