Babjan, ‘Mas Merah’ concerns the titular character who is daughter to a family with two feuding wives. Her mother is Mak Merah, who shares a husband (Pak Sagai) with Mak Gelam. Unfortunately, the pair of mothers are not on good terms with each other, often resorting to verbal abuse and catfights to settle their differences. The animosity and resentment get so far as to incite Mak Gelam to injure and kill Mak Merah. After her mother’s death and accusations of impropriety against her, Mas Merah is forced to leave her family and kampong to seek refuge in the wilderness. There, she meets Awang Sulong, a prince who is born and raised in the forest as a consequence of the king’s blind belief in the slander of his mother Puteri Mayang Mengurai. Together, they seek to do good and reverse the atmosphere of lies and betrayals clouding the kampong and the royal court.","popularity":0.0774,"poster_path":"/kyDAQEyPWAMcet7j3LltoSTjqLj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malay Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mas Merah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Mahmud","original_name":"Ahmad Mahmud","popularity":0.2285,"profile_path":"/5B8nEB8WqjZkpWDYvztigiHvncu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56243ba492514127d40046b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1278926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Datin Saadiah","original_name":"Datin Saadiah","popularity":0.1831,"profile_path":"/tR6OAiYoMOCHkBe5HkKSWRLdxky.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56243bb092514135b00039e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sri Dewi","original_name":"Sri Dewi","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56243bc192514135b00039ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
