His only interest is drinking. One day he falls in love and his boring life begins to change. The film is based on the book “Actor, Takuji Kameoka” by Akito Inui, a five-time nominee for Japan’s most prestigious literary prize, the Akutagawa Prize. Satoko Yokohama, a much-admired up-and-coming newcomer, directs the film and we can immediately tell that she is a special talent, with a unique understanding that flows through to her actors and crew.","popularity":1.1133,"poster_path":"/tqEUFeq0lpElI4OHzbHT988FJMM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Actor","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Haiyû Kameoka Takuji","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Yasuda","original_name":"安田顕","popularity":0.6032,"profile_path":"/mSEnXFHj8MnighBVG0yZdKOVyxI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Takuji Kameoka","credit_id":"5629b891925141284a001250","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumiko Aso","original_name":"麻生久美子","popularity":1.0692,"profile_path":"/pVOiHNMaIpue64dRg1GbXnSmMJK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Azumi Murota","credit_id":"56ba537ec3a3687c9e000779","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1398752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shohei Uno","original_name":"宇野祥平","popularity":0.4176,"profile_path":"/xgjFsFTr7oJYqWGaaJabFW47aVV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Taihei Uno","credit_id":"56ba539fc3a3687c990008be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hirofumi Arai","original_name":"新井浩文","popularity":0.3821,"profile_path":"/8nG16y3euYjEB9ZfZP2ixx7DpXy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yamanoue","credit_id":"56ba53d2c3a3687caf0009bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shota Sometani","original_name":"染谷将太","popularity":0.7316,"profile_path":"/sEEfyEfEbd9TQB9gFlvDTQJov76.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yokota","credit_id":"56ba53e6c3a3687ca1000815","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kodai Asaka","original_name":"浅香航大","popularity":0.66,"profile_path":"/hYIiTRPhOWjCjEUuqAVFgJSC1cp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Toru Kaizuka","credit_id":"56ba540192514171890007f4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Satoko Yokohama","original_name":"横浜聡子","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":"/eMDRg7EXQCRIu06B1RwbqinRaic.jpg","credit_id":"5629b880c3a3681b4d001605","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoshihide Otomo","original_name":"大友良英","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/eUUUsrlRIKvXIaeqBe4S6vZpbxv.jpg","credit_id":"638e8a5266a0d300d7416b61","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Matsuo","original_name":"松尾崇","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6645c8164ec66580d0eed63b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Satoko Yokohama","original_name":"横浜聡子","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":"/eMDRg7EXQCRIu06B1RwbqinRaic.jpg","credit_id":"5e3b52710c27100013761123","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434736,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yoichi Kamakari","original_name":"鎌苅洋一","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3b52b566e4690016cafe7e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5029177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akito Inui","original_name":"Akito Inui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6720af146e4210780f79a99f","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4844522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLTDM9KJXn7YIJFmieWHMbuWtn9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/tqEUFeq0lpElI4OHzbHT988FJMM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3658,"name":"career"},{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
