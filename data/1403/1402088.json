The film was made by Chipotle in conjunction with Passion Pictures, a renowned animation production company that has won multiple Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, Emmy Awards, and advertising awards for its feature films, television programming and commercial content, and CAA Marketing, and was directed by award-winning director, Saschka Unseld. The film is set to a remake of the Backstreet Boys’ 1999 hit song “I Want it That Way” recorded as a duet by GRAMMY Award® winner, Alabama Shakes’ lead singer Brittany Howard and GRAMMY Award® nominated My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James, and produced by GRAMMY Award® nominated producer Blake Mills. The song will be available for streaming on Spotify, Pandora, and SoundCloud.","popularity":0.1778,"poster_path":"/9kjNUpe74bqBZfAJ5emLTQBCFn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saschka Unseld","original_name":"Saschka Unseld","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675d734c6c04dc336615c7c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2029057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Howard","original_name":"Brittany Howard","popularity":0.1828,"profile_path":"/cPpRCCxSS5blyWq5RmrHteaNX8z.jpg","credit_id":"675d73f62fadeade24054b9e","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim James","original_name":"Jim James","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/70UcJebyNY4kmEbihMZwuneTJoC.jpg","credit_id":"675d745fb038b65eddd89e2b","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDVJlZGrowUTWa6p7Z5bzcSGdXU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2488},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eTLypdK5ENLXqT8KHwgUtYFPQYX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9kjNUpe74bqBZfAJ5emLTQBCFn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1267},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xhnNTzl2aI9pwV5KfQ8IOR5HrOC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1267}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
