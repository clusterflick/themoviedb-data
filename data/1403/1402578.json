The conversation naturally moves from the old them to missing 'black horn-rimmed eyeglasses.' 30 years ago, when the glasses floated to the surface of the sea, they all started to view the world differently. Now that they are older, they cannot see the world without glasses. Eyeglasses can sometimes be uncomfortable and bothersome, but while memories may fade away, the black horn-rimmed glasses have witnessed decades. The newly-appeared glasses bring with them a question - whether they can go through such difficult times again. The eyeglasses begin to give their own answers.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":257748,"logo_path":"/z0AjuHFGkFQi7rKoL0yj0FzqBEB.png","name":"Keumyoil Film","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Eyeglasses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Unburied Eyes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2654687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ko Du-hyun","original_name":"Ko Du-hyun","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675eb07e204f3b5b4830379b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3664819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Ju-yeon","original_name":"Yang Ju-yeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675eb0de5bd3c72a82c19e69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4672396,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Park Swan","original_name":"박수환","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675eb0f92cb96e5880c91c7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2654687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ko Du-hyun","original_name":"Ko Du-hyun","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675eb0ff6f84a0ce075e7c28","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
