On 01.04.2011, an official website for Mahou Shoujo Sonico Magika, a parody of SoniComi (a game by Nitroplus), was opened with the announcement of it being a TV anime. On the same day, the opening video for the so called TV anime was released on YouTube by NitroPlusChannel. This opening is essentially the entire anime. The title is a clear reference to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika, a TV anime which screenplay was written by a Nitroplus staffer Urobuchi Gen, who also got credited for screenplay for this anime on the official page. No screenplay was ever written, of course.","popularity":0.0982,"poster_path":"/aJ5s5JWEsG4F3pnBsKbjvKGhFhZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22600,"logo_path":"/13FsFa7wcjR3mj9zaGSSws4OyOA.png","name":"Nitroplus","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":121665,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio M2","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahou Shoujo Sonico Magica","video":true,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Puella Magi Sonico Magica","type":"Synonym"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJ5s5JWEsG4F3pnBsKbjvKGhFhZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
