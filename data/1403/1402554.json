Unfortunately, it is infamous for a legend of a former settlement that collapsed and was covered by the ground. The reason for that was the fact that the place had been inhabited by quarrelsome, envious, and malicious people. The modern legend predicts another catastrophe in 2000. In the 1970s, miners came to the town and tried to adapt to it. The unpleasant division between the old and the new inhabitants, between agricultural and industrial Łęczna, was felt by the newcomers.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/2XtnPVHf9E0WFcKWdKyWJ1xtRWj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1978-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fortune Favours Łęczna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrzej Piekutowski","original_name":"Andrzej Piekutowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675e966f551f69f77cadda2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrzej Piekutowski","original_name":"Andrzej Piekutowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675e967ae8a64ad77d763a68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563967,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leszek Krzyżański","original_name":"Leszek Krzyżański","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675e968ae8a64ad77d763a79","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1463169,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jadwiga Zajiček","original_name":"Jadwiga Zajiček","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/15bOUtefbKSrGpfzSHOqbjQ2Q4p.jpg","credit_id":"675e969a204f3b5b48303332","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0835814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2XtnPVHf9E0WFcKWdKyWJ1xtRWj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
