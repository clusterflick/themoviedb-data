The rainforest is a fascinating natural paradise. But the destruction of the tropical rainforest continues to progress. In just one hour, an area the size of 8,000 football fields disappears. Intact and healthy ecosystems are lost forever, irretrievably. What remains is poverty and destruction. The film is told by two senior surgeons at the Heidenheim Clinic who traveled to the rainforest in Indonesia for the first time and brought these recordings back with them. A unique and impressive film document was created. The two surgeons accompanied the doctor and biologist, Dr. Dr. Bernhard Lohr (chairman of the association \"Faszination Regenwald e.V.\" - www.verein-faszination-regenwald.de), on a trip to one of the last rainforests in Borneo at the foot of Mount Meratus, which is sacred to the locals.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/dnIziFWh5JBce7IFStqghkXcSJs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faszination Regenwald","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An old Tibetan saying goes: \"A tree that falls makes more noise than an entire forest that grows.\"","title":"Lesson Of Unreason","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marian Dora","original_name":"Marian Dora","popularity":0.4179,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"675ea1c496cfddbf19ccab71","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5120487,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","original_name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675e9e3296cfddbf19ccaa62","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5120487,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","original_name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675e9e3996cfddbf19ccaa68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5120487,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","original_name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675e9e3fe8a64ad77d763b0b","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5120487,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","original_name":"Thomas Hardtmuth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675e9e5ce8a64ad77d763b17","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uwe Jordan","original_name":"Uwe Jordan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772de104111599e38128db6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uwe Jordan","original_name":"Uwe Jordan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772de31bf10ff198461f243","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uwe Jordan","original_name":"Uwe Jordan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772de37d8dc22e6c69281d5","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5149437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uwe Jordan","original_name":"Uwe Jordan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6772de3d4111599e38128dd2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21041552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gkcaYEpy5PohKGp4XsJzk7DuuYb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dnIziFWh5JBce7IFStqghkXcSJs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2019-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lektion der Unvernunft - ein Film von Dr. Uwe Jordan","key":"MWMLKHF6aQQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-18T10:05:29.000Z","id":"675e9f21204f3b5b483034fc"}]}}}
