In winter, they are transformed by snow and ice into a vast mountaineering and climbing arena. To reach the summit of every Munro in a single winter is almost unheard of, yet Kevin Woods sets out to attempt just this.  This film explores the beauty and brutality of the highest Scottish mountains, the legacies of those who have come before, and the relentless drive in pursuit of a dream.","popularity":0.0372,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Climbing all of Scotland's Munros in a Single Winter","title":"WILD: Winter 282","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
