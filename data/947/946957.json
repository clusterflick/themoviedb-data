Ten years later the films are unearthed from the soil and projected. Ghosts have appeared on the surface of the decaying celulloid, they are the protagonists of Niles Atallah's earlier feature films \"Lucia\" and \"Rey\". The fictional characters have returned to haunt the images, peering through the layers of earth, as if interested in us, the spectators who watch them. Who is looking at who? Why have these characters returned? What do they want? The film is a secret code written by the earth itself.","popularity":0.1138,"poster_path":"/sKbC8byIeSvcygpKRqKevzvXuIq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diluvio","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2022-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burial: Subterranean Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Lisboa","original_name":"Rodrigo Lisboa","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"623d40a6fd6fa10047ab4477","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriela Aguilera","original_name":"Gabriela Aguilera","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/saxbX6VpTqP4B1m5KqRi0EA7Voc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"623d40affd6fa10047ab44b7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niles Atallah","original_name":"Niles Atallah","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/b9m2uiBVkumKvbbtaVN6Rp12ayy.jpg","credit_id":"6226b05b5249780046b76e8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niles Atallah","original_name":"Niles Atallah","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/b9m2uiBVkumKvbbtaVN6Rp12ayy.jpg","credit_id":"623d40bdb4224200882dcd5b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niles Atallah","original_name":"Niles Atallah","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/b9m2uiBVkumKvbbtaVN6Rp12ayy.jpg","credit_id":"623d40cf9ca759008b4b9453","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niles Atallah","original_name":"Niles Atallah","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/b9m2uiBVkumKvbbtaVN6Rp12ayy.jpg","credit_id":"623d40da945c20004a71682e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3479085,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sebasti치n Jatz Rawicz","original_name":"Sebasti치n Jatz Rawicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623d40ef7cffda005c839574","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sKbC8byIeSvcygpKRqKevzvXuIq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine UNAM","release_date":"2022-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
