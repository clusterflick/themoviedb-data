He trails Jim and steals another letter, written by Nell Borden. Jim's accomplice, which betrays the plot. This Shep brings to Jack, who then is able to convince May that trickery and Jim's jealousy are behind their estrangement.

The noise of their struggle wakes May, who summons Jack and the police.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shep the Sentinel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shep the Dog","original_name":"Shep the Dog","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/1jH22LLoybdCmkXascu8BWbtpBc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shep","credit_id":"6224f399e32943006f4b3c3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3455153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reenie Farrington","original_name":"Reenie Farrington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"May","credit_id":"6224f3abe32943001da7d9d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1902131,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nolan Gane","original_name":"Nolan Gane","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/zQNXHflp6S9TfdCRrVUH7MLImnW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jack - May's Sweetheart","credit_id":"6224f3b8e32943001da7da22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1933234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Kroell","original_name":"Claire Kroell","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6224f3c0a24c500041f27b33","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3455150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John W.
