In the first of an evening of programmes marking the 30th anniversary of Top of the Pops, Smashie and Nicey (Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse) pay tribute to this triumphant survivor from the days when the Beatles topped the chart with I Wanna Hold Your Hand.  Three poptastic decades surrender their fab sounds, their hits and their haircuts, for our nostalgic enjoyment - from the Moptops to Take That, from the Stones to Madonna.","popularity":0.4682,"poster_path":"/6AwYceVDXHM6B2TmL0oBXApjoAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Whatever happened to those one-hit wonders ?","title":"Smashie and Nicey's Top of the Pops Party","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Whitehouse","original_name":"Paul Whitehouse","popularity":0.7394,"profile_path":"/4aacb6fRghFwrT636cYmAYqQ35o.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Smashie","credit_id":"62233ee521c4ca004454322a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Enfield","original_name":"Harry Enfield","popularity":0.4925,"profile_path":"/fzrYlkfm4JhfM9eKuO7xsZzFeaf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nicey","credit_id":"62233ed721c4ca001d8d79ac","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Plowman","original_name":"Jon Plowman","popularity":0.1823,"profile_path":"/vVlC4KaJ2dHFdYU8FTvuxLFnphR.jpg","credit_id":"62233f0e73520500447a953e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mY38nJzaBpOp5vxVkdpEYMt0nDA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/U7vmNJpfobP19kJOAXlwrzSBXk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6AwYceVDXHM6B2TmL0oBXApjoAS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
