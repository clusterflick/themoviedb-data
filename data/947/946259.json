While at the Djerassi Artist in Residency Program in California, the artist constructed a screen with wood and canvas and installed it in the programâ€™s sculpture park. Still standing there, it is an unexpected object on the way to a scenic view of the rolling hills on the Djerassi property.  In A proposal to project in 4:3, Schmid shot this site-specific installation over the course of a single day when the screen became projection surface for the subtle interplay of shadow and light from the surrounding trees and shrubs. Cinema without film.
