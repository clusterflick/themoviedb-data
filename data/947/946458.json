Mrs. Jameson, his wife, is walking about the estate accompanied by her six months' old baby and its nurse. She stops and speaks kindly to Lass and her little family. Picking up one of the little dogs, she playfully puts it in the carriage with the baby and petting the little animal, returns it to its mother. She continues upon her walk. This same little puppy strays away from its little brothers and sisters and reaching the railroad tracks, it wanders into the next village, where it is met by a crowd of youngsters that are gathered about the station. They playfully abuse the little animal.","popularity":0.1128,"poster_path":"/fpcUwmtCtmr5NsdkzmIribiy8ZR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shep, the Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shep the Dog","original_name":"Shep the Dog","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/1jH22LLoybdCmkXascu8BWbtpBc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shep","credit_id":"6224f46dc9054f0044cf6587","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Runa Hodges","original_name":"Runa Hodges","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Baby Runa","credit_id":"6224f47ae323f3006cc6bdfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3418609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hoskins","original_name":"Charles Hoskins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Gladwin - the Old Cab Driver","credit_id":"6224f487590086001ba0a28e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Phillips","original_name":"Ethel Phillips","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bGo35tF9KS2JUQKELrA62FynH0m.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Jameson","credit_id":"6224f49b46f3540044a7033d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Scardon","original_name":"Paul Scardon","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/oG3lLUua8hXZfblwRAJnA5NIesO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Jameson","credit_id":"6224f4b885da12006b7ecadc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas R.
