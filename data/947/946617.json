Structuring a beginning, a climax and an ending. An inquiry into the construction of (self) identity, gender issues, memory, and the process of rewriting/reimagining personal recollections. Assembled as a chapter for an autobiographical long film called An Appropriated Self-Portrait, edited using a fragmentary structure that relies on a linear narrative.","popularity":0.0474,"poster_path":"/wYu5v5QBBpvT10m3zzaEf0q4kPF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The History of Sadness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María José Alós","original_name":"María José Alós","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62258ddec9044c0043fd50ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3455939,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francisco Eme","original_name":"Francisco Eme","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62258deebccf1e0072e45c66","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYu5v5QBBpvT10m3zzaEf0q4kPF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
