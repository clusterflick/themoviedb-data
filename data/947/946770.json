A fundamental change in our relationship with nature is the only way out of this emergency. The notions of domination, control and exploitation should give way to those of cohabitation, partnership, synergy and pacification. For a small Central American country, this is already a reality. Indeed, Costa Rica is the third country in the world to have abolished the death penalty in 1877, then abolished its army in 1948. The army's budget was transferred to education and the protection of biodiversity. Today, 25% of its territory is classified as a park or nature reserve and the country is home to 6% of the world's biodiversity, for an area of 0.03%. It is through the example of Costa Rica that we want to demonstrate that it is possible to be PACIFIC with the Earth, to safeguard biodiversity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9Iiit1Tqapki9RnEuoP4YQkgtc7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Museo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pacifique, à la rencontre du Costa Rica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Duval","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Duval","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622628b095acf00064f11fde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Duval","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Duval","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622628ba07a808006add2de1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Breton","original_name":"Caroline Breton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622628d4a3770a006f1d5bf8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Breton","original_name":"Caroline Breton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622628cac51acd006d2f5bc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18549682","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9Iiit1Tqapki9RnEuoP4YQkgtc7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1203}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
