Her father volunteers to have the ring mended and bring it to her. On her first day at school a new pupil is enrolled, the motherless daughter of a resident, who personally escorts the child to school. The acquaintance thus begun ripens into love. The girl's father writes that he is coming to visit her. He does not come, but is brought in, dead, by men who have found his body on the trail, a victim of bandits. When the girl resumes her school work, her lover's daughter, among others, brings her a little token of sympathy.","popularity":0.4463,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Young School Teacher","credit_id":"62252275ed28b9001b054e2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Carey","original_name":"Harry Carey","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/AvNDsYjkLgeFHbxGFIFyl6QRgeM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Bandit","credit_id":"62252293680be8001c7a67f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.M.
