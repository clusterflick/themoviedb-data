The dog is not happy in his unnatural surroundings, and on the first opportunity, he runs away to the home of Mrs. Smith, the Gladwin's washerwoman, where he is in his element frolicking with Bobbie Smith's dog. When the Gladwins find him there, they see their error. They take Mrs. Smith and her boy home to live in their beautiful house, and the two dogs are given a kennel in the yard.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dog's Good Deed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Jones","original_name":"Morgan Jones","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/p6i6dkjmeOgopaT31qgr5kJurZS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Gladwin","credit_id":"622501e5e375c0004314e1f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1902198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Waite","original_name":"Virginia Waite","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Gladwin","credit_id":"622501f24a52f8004318716c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shep the Dog","original_name":"Shep the Dog","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/1jH22LLoybdCmkXascu8BWbtpBc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shep","credit_id":"622501ffe375c0001b16ca8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1902199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leland Benham","original_name":"Leland Benham","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/l6UeFQqzaCULKMtwFWPQOKNVO25.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bobby Smith","credit_id":"62250211e3294300447c10c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1518416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fannie Bourke","original_name":"Fannie Bourke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/blbrvuUqNeALfxXWHBYUsOmDmqD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bobby's Mother","credit_id":"6225021fc9054f0044cfa21a","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0442147","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
