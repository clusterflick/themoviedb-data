The camera travels to Africa, where infections overwhelm the public health system and orphans face their own deaths, central Europe, where drug users spread the disease via shared needles, India, where husbands infect wives, and to the U.S., where grass-roots efforts in places like Kansas City confront cultural stereotypes. Interviews include patients, doctors, nurses, the Dalai Lama, and Kofi Annan. The film's tone is compassionate and urgent, and the statistics overwhelming.","popularity":0.1067,"poster_path":"/dfBZPGXPenP74pJlgB5XIKTaIOR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about AIDS in the world.
