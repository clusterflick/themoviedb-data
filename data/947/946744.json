Within a couple of weeks she turned completely bald. The diagnosis: Alopecia areata. It causes Maya's body to reject every single hair like a foreign object. Two years later she has gotten used to her baldness. But summer is a brutal time for her. It's too hot to hide under a wig or a hat. Then, Maya feels naked, and she asks herself: How do others perceive me? Am I alright the way I am? Am I beautiful? Almost like a way to provide the answers, Maya takes lots of selfies, just like her friends. And somewhere in between swiping, liking and sharing, the girls are growing into young women. MySelfie is a documentary that observes the levels of self-perception and external perception that Maya and her friends are experiencing. It is not about narcissism but about searching and finding one's inner self, and eventually self-love. A coming-of-age film that portrays the self-exploration of a whole generation by looking at Maya's story.","popularity":0.059,"poster_path":"/usT60WHfi7lXLYnkkZ9UrcEVMmY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97631,"logo_path":null,"name":"In One Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"mySELFie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Scheschonk","original_name":"Anne Scheschonk","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622611dca7e363001c55c377","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11122654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4cWdt2hMm7hycc5fsuN8Am7bOli.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/usT60WHfi7lXLYnkkZ9UrcEVMmY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
