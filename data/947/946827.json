He wires his friend, Ace Brent, the capitalist, who has a half-interest in his discoveries, to furnish him with money to make the trip back across the desert to officially stake his claim. But \"Lonney\" Smith, telegraph operator at the town and secret spy for The Syndicate, Brent's rivals, informs his employers of the new \"strike,\" and they dispatch their agent Meyers to thwart Brent. The latter, recovering from injuries received in a previous encounter with sheep herders, consents to allow Barbara to handle the affair. Her admirer, John Wallace, follows her to the desert town, fearing for her safety. The action then develops into a thrilling three-cornered race across the desert between Barbara and John, Lonney and Meyers, and a gang of local adventurers headed by \"Dry Wash\" Sexton, proprietor of the \"saloon and hotel.\"","popularity":0.2556,"poster_path":"/uWkTOB0NMKRVrQf6fU127xxiiJM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Turquoise Mine Conspiracy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marin Sais","original_name":"Marin Sais","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/3AFsydIl9Vu2UhPZsPCETWLoh0l.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Barbara Brent","credit_id":"622658b16af8f800466f9fd7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"True Boardman","original_name":"True Boardman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lQCtb4xD1O6zBuW1LWNa9MaJNps.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Congressman John Wallace","credit_id":"622658c0647654006fbb9556","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack McDonald","original_name":"Jack McDonald","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/ugI4hSBdSZk7m7H8ij60dDWVW2K.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sidewinder Steve","credit_id":"622658cfd11e0e006c4482ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert N.
