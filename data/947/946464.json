Civil conflict in the area prevented international experts from conducting a full and thorough investigation.  The wreckage should have been collected and scrupulously re-assembled to identify all the damage, but this standard investigative procedure was never carried out. Until thatâ€™s done, evidence can only be gleaned from pictures of the debris, the flight recorders or black boxes and eye-witnesses' testimonies.  This may be enough to help build a picture of what really happened to the aircraft, whether a rocket fired from the ground or gunfire from a military jet.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/8flsBcOIZFnQjeOCSlhPFdvkKK2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exploring possible causes of the tragedy","title":"MH-17: The Untold Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1556,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8flsBcOIZFnQjeOCSlhPFdvkKK2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
