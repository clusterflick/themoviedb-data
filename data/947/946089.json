At the evocation of this name, one spontaneously thinks of the intellectual superstar Duras, adulated or hated, with her big glasses and turtleneck, who received the Goncourt prize for her mythical novel, \"L'Amant\". But behind the superstar writer, who either fascinates or annoys, and behind his double novel, the young Indochinese girl, with her hair pulled back and lips underlined with lipstick, which is precisely the subject of \"L'Amant\", are hidden other, perhaps less well-known facets of the character, a writer, but also a filmmaker, journalist, a woman committed to the left, a transient lover or a loving mother. Marguerite Duras will have had 1000 lives in one and many other faces. This film attempts to get as close as possible to this extraordinary destiny.","popularity":0.1174,"poster_path":"/56dIWjrhpmK2LXz8wxgpiSeszvZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marguerite Duras, l'écriture et la vie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marguerite Duras","original_name":"Marguerite Duras","popularity":0.3234,"profile_path":"/fcwhMcwUzh4AtHew16vS4OVDYdO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62238877d71fb4006cc8cf6e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2536367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lise Baron","original_name":"Lise Baron","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622386d14fd141004431febb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14089074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ak5gIdCax3tfycPWSGMAkigaDJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/56dIWjrhpmK2LXz8wxgpiSeszvZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
