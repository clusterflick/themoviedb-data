To achieve his dream he follows the advice of Stefano Salegi, a shady character who becomes his manager and forms a band. But, not just an energetic dreamer, Manu is an outsider with problems finding his place in society. That's clear by the instrument he's chosen —none other than the broom—  that he uses to make music and carry the rhythm. That won't keep him from starting a band completely sui generis that breaks all the clichés.","popularity":0.229,"poster_path":"/pYNQFBwLRMrulCYE59aMmPZl4Ma.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lotura
