The Film witnesses the march of widows of the 'Green Revolution' in Punjab as they re-negotiate the rules of engagement and the politics of domination, in their bid to survive.  For the first time, Candles in the Wind tells the story from inside this area, known as the green reserve of India, a place which is relentlessly transforming itself into a social desert, where women are obliged to take over dramatic situations without any form of protection or assistance.  Their struggle gives us a window into the social-economic flux in rural India - a nuanced understanding of the silent under-currents of a gender-specific struggle in the larger narrative of surviving as a farmer in these times.","popularity":0.1358,"poster_path":"/yKGnOUTWgpIN9OU5nGLKpMvcv4x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131397,"logo_path":null,"name":"PSBT","origin_country":""},{"id":66632,"logo_path":"/alQJKHLQlV3EFkCshP5pyLfI3z0.png","name":"Doordarshan","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":171040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Top Quark Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Candles in the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2837115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nandan Saxena","original_name":"Nandan Saxena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Nandan Saxena (voice)","credit_id":"6223110304733f001c8726cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3453073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kavita Bahl","original_name":"Kavita Bahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Kavita Bahl (voice)","credit_id":"62231117944a57001dcd6db3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2837115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nandan Saxena","original_name":"Nandan Saxena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62230d9df48e0d004348ca0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3453071,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sumon Roy Mahapatra","original_name":"Sumon Roy Mahapatra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62230ff44f9a99006d3abf96","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3453073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kavita Bahl","original_name":"Kavita Bahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6223101c8ee49c001bfb0f88","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3453073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kavita Bahl","original_name":"Kavita Bahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6223103b8ee49c0044c61def","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179170,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amrita Pritam","original_name":"Amrita Pritam","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622310604fd141006d93ff61","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354006,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saikat Kumar Singha","original_name":"Saikat Kumar Singha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622310a4af85de0045b69ec1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610709,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Navnita Sen","original_name":"Navnita Sen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622310b604733f006c84ffb4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15469372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ohnQWUmdEaX21idjfFYNK9OZYZZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yKGnOUTWgpIN9OU5nGLKpMvcv4x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pa","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Candles in the Wind","key":"501617787","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-18T05:20:27.000Z","id":"62230fb5e1ad79006b783ba7"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CANDLES IN THE WIND- Top Quark Films","key":"122247626","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-03-15T17:52:20.000Z","id":"62230d2b944a5700454a8986"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Candles in the Wind","key":"aOaXpbaxeIc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-10-20T12:56:39.000Z","id":"62230d14e9da690043d86b73"}]}}}
