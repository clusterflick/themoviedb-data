After six worshipers are killed by a white supremacist, the local community finds inspiration in the Sikh tradition of forgiveness and faith. Lieutenant Murphy, shot 15 times in the attack, joins the mayor and police chief as they forge new bonds with the Sikh community. Young temple members, still grieving, emerge as leaders in the quest to end the violence. In the year following the tragedy, thousands gather for vigils and community events to honour the victims and seek connection. Together, a community rocked by hate is awakened and transformed by the Sikh spirit of relentless optimism.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/aVJGgMQkuh6tfCTA0PNu90NHKy5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waking in Oak Creek","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3377832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aVJGgMQkuh6tfCTA0PNu90NHKy5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Waking in Oak Creek Trailer","key":"1Dw98jBitGU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-11-30T22:14:30.000Z","id":"622425b44a0b19001d8b255c"}]}}}
