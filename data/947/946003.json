Later, from 1950 to 1951, he became the high commissioner and the commander-in-chief of Indochina where he once again proved heroic by defeating General Giap three times on the run. But cancer forced him to return to Paris where he died some time later. De Lattre de Tassigny was posthumously made Maréchal de France.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":"/jlaWq3ogcVeSkpuyviYUox27EqW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1954-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The March to Glory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Davy","original_name":"Jean Davy","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":"/siYYO0uh4is0D4FgSnrVfQtgxob.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6222e9faf48e0d0043486cca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1330342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean de Lattre de Tassigny","original_name":"Jean de Lattre de Tassigny","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6222e9ffaf85de006e3eb9e7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Magnin","original_name":"William Magnin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6222e9ad94d8a8006bef064f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Gaspard-Huit","original_name":"Pierre Gaspard-Huit","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/eQ8J923bNM2hM80S0CkZpWifbvm.jpg","credit_id":"6222e9a4f48e0d001b69cd96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0261045","wikidata_id":"Q23899231","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jlaWq3ogcVeSkpuyviYUox27EqW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
