Three days later, that baby disappeared from her crib. They continued to search for her for 17 years after her second daughter, Cassidy, went to a new school in 2015 and met someone who looked like her. DNA tests have shown that she is their lost daughter. Zephany, who grew up as Miché Solomon, was taken to a place of safe custody and the woman she had known as her all her life was arrested and eventually sent to prison. However, Miché chose to stay with her abductor and not by her biological parents.
