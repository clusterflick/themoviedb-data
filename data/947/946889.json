Through the use of traditional acrobatic circus disciplines, as well as indigenous dance, certain scenes subtly address social injustices; others look again at the history of cultural art forms and explore themes such as brotherhood despite race. MOYA shows what it's deeply about at the Zip Zap circus. It reflects the past, present and future of our multicultural nation and celebrates it through the beauty of art and movement that brings people together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7ceOMwj5tvNDIBCMFYKV7AwlmrB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ceOMwj5tvNDIBCMFYKV7AwlmrB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
