However, upon finding the weird and wonderful world of rock climbing, she dedicated her life to mountain sports and becoming an IFMGA guide. Despite her love for the work, existing in the mountain guiding industry led her to feel unsafe publicly expressing her true gender identity. It was only after a life changing accident and a series of serious wake up calls that she took time off guiding and started to seek support and therapy for cPTSD.  Join Julianna on her journey to self-discovery in the face of an industry that struggles to accept folks who currently fall into the margins of mountain culture. Visiting the mountain-scapes that were her livelihood, she confronts her past experiences and her journey’s cost.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty In A Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nat Segal","original_name":"Nat Segal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6969602b42230a67ed94b82c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
