A speculative tower rises from the river as myth, while digital avatars echo dispossession. Moving between geology, memory and politics, the film asks how cities and landscapes remember, and whether fragments of the past can resist erasure and ecological ruin.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hQx3S3kj1U3FjSive4O6qobsDwE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As Dust, as Rain, as a Line on the Map and a Crack in History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5942751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HUNITI GOLDOX","original_name":"HUNITI GOLDOX","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696a2d3c4ef345661794be59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5942752,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erida Bendo","original_name":"Erida Bendo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696a2d9faff24da306c7b96c","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5942753,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Korhan Erel","original_name":"Korhan Erel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696a2db12bc3a279c2c7b93a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5942754,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erald Halili","original_name":"Erald Halili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696a2dbdc410638856d7e70e","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Cinematographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1492,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQx3S3kj1U3FjSive4O6qobsDwE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":994}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
