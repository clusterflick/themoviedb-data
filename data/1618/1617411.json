By 1998, when this film was made, Winton had already won the Miles Franklin Award twice (for Shallows, 1984 and  Cloudstreet, 1992) and been shortlisted for the Booker Prize for The Riders (1995). In THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, shot partly on the magnificent coast and hinterland of Australia’s north-west, Winton talks frankly about his work, his influences and what drives him.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Edge of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
