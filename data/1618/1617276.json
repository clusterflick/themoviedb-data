The documentary follows a Jewish Israeli woman (Emma Sham-Ba Ayalon) and a Palestinian woman ( Dina Awwad-Srour) who were  touched by Etty Hillesum's diary, and started a peace project in Israel and the occupied territories. Using short excerpts from Etty's diary, they have developed cards that they use for peace work and inner work. Etty Hillesum's personal quest for a humane future resonates with the participants of these gatherings and help them to renew their vision of peace. When the names of all deported Jews are read in Westerbork, Emma and Dina join a retreat of the Zen Peacemakers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mc4egu3GZizbuIS98OH8bLT4GzP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bringing Etty Hillesum to Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Awwad-Srour","original_name":"Dina Awwad-Srour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69697459e88fdc77f7f585ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Sham-Ba Ayalon","original_name":"Emma Sham-Ba Ayalon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69697464da326a5e6fd66565","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4630555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat van Boeckel","original_name":"Pat van Boeckel","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696974b7a9c30e665dc7b462","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":948,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mc4egu3GZizbuIS98OH8bLT4GzP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":632}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer: Bringing Etty Hillesum to Life","key":"Q5UEL9ID2Ks","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-24T14:30:03.000Z","id":"696972f83d7db064127f1c03"}]}}}
