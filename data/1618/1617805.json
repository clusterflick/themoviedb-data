The documentary places the rise of AI within the broader historical context of cinema’s evolution, drawing parallels with earlier technological shifts such as the introduction of sound, colour, and digital visual effects. By revisiting landmark moments in film history, the film demonstrates that disruption has always been part of cinema’s DNA, while questioning whether AI represents a fundamentally different kind of change.  Featuring insights from directors, academics, and practitioners, Prompt: Make a Documentary explores the tension between innovation and integrity, the democratisation of creative tools, and the ethical implications of automation in the arts. The film ultimately asks whether artificial intelligence will empower the next generation of storytellers or redefine creativity itself.","popularity":0.1357,"poster_path":"/aGStw7s5gRhVUIxLmBghBmdFkpX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2027-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In
