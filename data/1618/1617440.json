It is one of the world’s most populous countries and over 80 percent of its people are Muslim. The military plays a significant role in politics in Indonesia and at the time of filming, the government was headed by President Suharto, an army general. This series looks at the lives of seven very different people, all Indonesian. Through these individuals, we gain contrasting perspectives on Indonesia which contribute to our understanding of this nation’s complex character.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Human Face of Indonesia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
