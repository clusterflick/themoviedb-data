This piece was shot entirely on 16mm motion-picture film using a Bolex H16 Rex-5, converted to Super 16.  The project moves from day to night, weaving together moments from three boroughs, uptown, downtown, and everything in-between. It highlights New York’s classic architecture, its evolving skyline, and the everyday rhythm of people moving through the city. Street photography, urban grit, and quiet cinematic moments all live side by side here.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5rg3b8qdVCE5Pm0KwPSLqOJw1sA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NYC on 16mm Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Szpot","original_name":"Mike Szpot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69694089dd43f3820bdbd3eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1700,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rg3b8qdVCE5Pm0KwPSLqOJw1sA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
