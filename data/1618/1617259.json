As Harold begins his journey, all is well until many mishaps start to impede his journey to Mabel's. After many treacherous days of traveling via horseback in the Navajo backcountry, Harold arrives at Mabel's homestead only to find out that the family only speaks Navajo. Harold who speaks very little Navajo, struggles to communicate with them and is immediately tasked by Mabel with cleaning the homestead, mending corrals, and many other strenuous chores on the property with Rita. Harold and Rita have no idea what their mothers have secretly planned. Harold's arrival at the homestead is far from just a coincidence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2W3IjpMfROLQDTnTr5fZVR8HBqF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sheephead
