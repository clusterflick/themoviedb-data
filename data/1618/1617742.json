This short film was shot entirely in the rain in Times Square, New York City — a place where the lines between reality and dystopia already blur. In this piece, I explore themes of endless rain, overbearing advertising, the creeping rise of AI, mass surveillance, the sexualization of everything, and the Disney-fication of public space. It’s about the feeling of being watched, commodified, and slowly consumed by a world we thought only existed in fiction.  The video is intercut with street photographs I’ve taken between 2019 and 2025, capturing a slow evolution into this strange future-present. The footage itself was shot between 2024 and 2025. This is Dystopia: a personal blend of street photography, cyberpunk aesthetics, and sci-fi-inspired visual storytelling.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sgPiMnu1dCHJvw3l1R8f1l0Yxs2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dystopia: Cyberpunk Streets of New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Szpot","original_name":"Mike Szpot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696a3809b93f0db60fc7b887","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AjNGWXxJ0L1R6Y1YO7I93vGxQns.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sgPiMnu1dCHJvw3l1R8f1l0Yxs2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
