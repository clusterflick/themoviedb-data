During the war, thousands of women were systematically raped and tortured by the Pakistan Army and their collaborators. But they were not only victims of sexual violence, they were also in the front lines of the popular resistance against the occupying Army, as fighters and martyrs. Narir Kotha is an attempt to explore some of these stories, through the words of the women themselves.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":286352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Āina Sāliśa Kendra","origin_country":""},{"id":163467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audiovision","origin_country":""},{"id":166990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tareque Masud Memorial Trust","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women and War: Trauma and Triumph of Women in '71","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Masud","original_name":"Catherine Masud","popularity":0.1873,"profile_path":"/aycYl4zyNQRllrphkRQA3yW4k9A.jpg","credit_id":"696a3646e88fdc77f7f58d1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tareque Masud","original_name":"Tareque Masud","popularity":0.1998,"profile_path":"/kB8ZcaO8PQtE5zrsiUPEimLVYMo.jpg","credit_id":"696a3657a0ed3a3951dc8800","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5942823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shaheen Akhtar","original_name":"Shaheen Akhtar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696a36794499dedf23d7e494","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Masud","original_name":"Catherine Masud","popularity":0.1873,"profile_path":"/aycYl4zyNQRllrphkRQA3yW4k9A.jpg","credit_id":"696a3685324820941dd7e9bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tareque Masud","original_name":"Tareque Masud","popularity":0.1998,"profile_path":"/kB8ZcaO8PQtE5zrsiUPEimLVYMo.jpg","credit_id":"696a3691a1d897ce25d66ae8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11159,"name":"wartime"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":266827,"name":"bangladesh liberation war"},{"id":365887,"name":"global issues"},{"id":365888,"name":"wartime conditions"},{"id":365889,"name":"military tactics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
