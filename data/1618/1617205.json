Since it is assumed that Brooks was childless, Jim inherits his cousin's fortune. At a slave market he buys a young girl named Perdita and sends her to a convent in Corsica to be educated. Years later, Jim meets Perdita again while traveling through Corsica with the impecunious Duchess of Westgate and her daughter, Lady Lilah Grey. When the party stops at an inn, Jim discovers that Perdita is not only a Persian princess, but also the long-lost daughter of Brooks, and therefore the rightful heir to Brooks' fortune.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3lzZH8yOzpUuJOvXxThY0KKWWt9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16101,"logo_path":"/2yI4rjPZ1I7TLZ2UWvTtXifYEnw.png","name":"Metro Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Demon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Storey","original_name":"Edith Storey","popularity":0.2815,"profile_path":"/r8iO5KZFDf3V7o13KWlB67iuWZK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Princess Perdita","credit_id":"696958ea4fad23a4c7f40d47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Cody","original_name":"Lew Cody","popularity":0.4286,"profile_path":"/mDq8vt8e6PZ1aX7KC8Xbs0ujr2I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim Lassells","credit_id":"696958f43ff9064092f40db8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles K.
