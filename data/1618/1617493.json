Aside from the first two and Max (presumably Bellocchio) these seem wholly erroneous - compounded by a flash for VCA Pictures and a directorial credit for Henry Pachard. The actual male cast seems exclusively Italian and includes Francesco Malcom and Silvio Evangelista.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monia...La Pantera Rossa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lWKzOwtsdAmv1nNOZ4A3ehPoXca.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
