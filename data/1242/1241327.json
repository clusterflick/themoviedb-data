For this challenge we were given three rules: we had to include a mask as a prop, the following line of dialogue: “Is this politically correct?”, and lastly, we had to pull a horror sub-genre out of a hat to allow for a different sub-genre for every team.

The film was eventually screened in one of our local cinema’s.","popularity":0.336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An investigative journalist develops photos of mysterious murders, however something is lurking…","title":"It Came From the Tap","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4521466,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandro Castro","original_name":"Alexandro Castro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"65c24381f44f270163c0ecd0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedi Loore Puusepp","original_name":"Hedi Loore Puusepp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bruce","credit_id":"65c243b4f44f270184c1938a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521475,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Damien Lippert","original_name":"Damien Lippert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c247eebbe1dd01612a8021","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Verrinder","original_name":"Nina Verrinder","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c243dff44f270149c057bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521473,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maanika Mathur","original_name":"Maanika Mathur","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2449a8e8d30017b78dfd9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittoria Casalena","original_name":"Vittoria Casalena","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c244d09369a201849d86a9","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4521466,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandro Castro","original_name":"Alexandro Castro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c244819369a201849d865f","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4521466,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandro Castro","original_name":"Alexandro Castro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2446afc5f060189c55673","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521475,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Damien Lippert","original_name":"Damien Lippert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c244b4fc5f060189c556cf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Verrinder","original_name":"Nina Verrinder","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2483defea7a00c95151f6","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4521466,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandro Castro","original_name":"Alexandro Castro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2482cbbe1dd01612a8024","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittoria Casalena","original_name":"Vittoria Casalena","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c24811f44f270163c0ef1b","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31173033","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":314753,"name":"film festival"},{"id":320717,"name":"48hourfilmfestival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
