WA, in 1993 set in the Seattle era of grunge and sub-pop at its best! A cohort of physical anthropology students and their wonderful teacher see their lives horrifically up-ended as, by turns the students are brutally murdered by a gruesomely masked attacker. As they learn about the bones in the human body in their class, they start to find real bones, or pieces of bones show up in their homes, cars, classroom. When they gather in their social groups to speculate about who the murderer could be, that person is invariably killed off. It is left to Sherriff Bracco, Laurie the County Coroner and their teacher, Kelly, to find out who the real bone crunching murderer is.","popularity":0.5683,"poster_path":"/3iwh0k9zewVCkLDv69EPfPXwe6p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post
