The Soviet Union's leading scientists and researchers conducted extensive studies on the impact of nuclear weapons on urban areas. They constructed simulated towns, complete with real buildings and even metro stations, to observe and assess the aftermath. These dedicated researchers identified the zones where immediate death would occur, areas where survival was possible but would result in blindness, and regions where individuals would live, but their offspring would suffer from mutations for years to come. They conducted experiments and meticulously analyzed the outcomes, and yet, judging by its current state, it appears as though the entire project was abandoned without a care.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuclear Lessons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4522586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Lyadov","original_name":"Anton Lyadov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c314b7b76cbb01840fc79e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
