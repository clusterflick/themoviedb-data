Despite several distress signals relaying their location, as well as repeated interactions with at least one military helicopter and a military ship, they were left to drift for 14 days. As a result of the inaction of all state actors involved, only nine of the passengers survived. By combining their testimonies with wind and sea-current data as well as satellite imagery, Forensic Oceanography reconstructed the liquid traces of this event, producing a report that served as the basis of several legal complaints. -FA","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/62fdxa8VTYYeyf8oztPTTn71eud.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Left-to-Die Boat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4520971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Oceanography","original_name":"Forensic Oceanography","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c1e8668e8d3000e57765ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62fdxa8VTYYeyf8oztPTTn71eud.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
