Erwan, a local fisherman, is spellbound. He ventures into their world of joy and celebration and discovers, behind the costumes of the stage characters, tormented, lonely, over-sensitive human beings ready to do anything to carry this project as far as possible. It's a portrait of a small port town inhabited as much by gloomy daily lives as by extraordinary destinies.","popularity":0.1087,"poster_path":"/lWhByKvYhrqkKFRYQsap6eG1txZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perspective
