The boat, a few hours out of Tripoli, was carrying between 130 and 150 passengers. A confrontational rescue operation ensued, and while SW was able to rescue fifty-nine passengers, bringing them to safety in Italy, at least twenty died before or during the incident, while forty-seven passengers were ultimately ‘pulled back’ to Libya, where several faced grave human rights violations – including being detained, beaten, and sold to another captor who tortured them to extract ransom from their families. -FA","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/r5Uyfyih30bB60vLDyQ5EWat0pv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea Watch vs the Libyan Coast Guard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4520971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Oceanography","original_name":"Forensic Oceanography","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c1ea96a0664501615df185","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c1ea8ea06645017a5e7a0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1617,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5Uyfyih30bB60vLDyQ5EWat0pv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
