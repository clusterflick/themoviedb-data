The main characters are guys of military age, ordinary Russians, without savings and the opportunity to leave the country. They are against war and are not afraid to talk about it and, moreover, they are not afraid to fight for their rights even where it seems that this is impossible. Bad and good Russians. Who are they and what do they look like? Did all the good people really leave Russia, or is there still someone left there?","popularity":0.6586,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Save and Be Saved","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1014983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizaveta Stishova","original_name":"Elizaveta Stishova","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/uiKrnLtksDfjFNO7f2ZowP3NTAa.jpg","credit_id":"65c31b34c15f890163f4fcff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
