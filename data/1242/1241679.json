Хождение в озеро","overview":"The Talab Islands, situated approximately 25 kilometers from the Estonian border and equidistant from Pskov, comprise three islands. Two of these, formerly known as Talabsk and Verkhniy, were renamed Zalit and Belov during the Soviet era to honor Red Army soldiers who tragically drowned in 1918 while attempting to establish Soviet power on the islands. In the past, Zalit was home to a thriving fishing collective farm, attracting local residents who had been engaging in lake-related activities for decades. However, contemporary bureaucratic challenges have hindered fishing activities, leading to a shift in the islands' economic focus towards tourism. Pilgrims now frequent the islands to visit the grave of Nikolai Guryanov, the former rector of the local church. Despite the islands' historical significance and tourism potential, they face challenges in terms of infrastructure and services.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island.
