His lungs were failing him and unless he got a double lung transplant soon, his death was imminent. Scott promised himself, if he got a second chance, he would make the most of it and have no regrets.  While waiting in a hospital bed, he made a list of all the things he would do in his life if gifted with a successful transplant.  Three months later after a harrowing journey, he received the miracle of his new lungs, which began one of the greatest comebacks any transplant survivor could endeavor.  In the years following his transplant, Scott would go on to become the first person with a double lung transplant to complete a full Ironman, and now he has his sights set on The Crossing For Cystic Fibrosis - an 80-mile ocean challenge.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/fVDkaCjAcShWwSXLjkOEI1UZt6v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double or Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4524449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makayla Wheeler","original_name":"Makayla Wheeler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c4346939a1a601620f93b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4524451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Travis Suit","original_name":"Travis Suit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c4347f0328b90183eb0127","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4524449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makayla Wheeler","original_name":"Makayla Wheeler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c434b9e18e3f018375eb38","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4524451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Travis Suit","original_name":"Travis Suit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c434c2e18e3f016275e9c8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":2873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fVDkaCjAcShWwSXLjkOEI1UZt6v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Released on Kickstarter","release_date":"2024-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DOUBLE OR NOTHING DOCUMENTARY FILM","key":"kYEBj0Ks6K0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-04T17:00:07.000Z","id":"65c3d97de267de017dbccb7d"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DOUBLE OR NOTHING OFFICIAL TRAILER","key":"SxeRX3zG5jA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-01T17:24:26.000Z","id":"65c3d96bb76cbb01841055d9"}]}}}
