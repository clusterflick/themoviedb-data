These children have witnessed horrific war crimes and suffered the loss of family and home, or they have become politicized combatants willing to take part in the conflict. Art therapy is used as a means of having the children express themselves to cope with the trauma of war, and the pictures that are drawn by these children are as sad as the stories of their countriesâ€™ conflicts. Using images of war rarely seen, this film sheds light on the terrifying trend of combatants deliberately targeting civilians, including children.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children in War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Raymond","original_name":"Susan Raymond","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c20dceefea7a018452a271","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Raymond","original_name":"Alan Raymond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c20dc79590e30182b2828e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0233445","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
