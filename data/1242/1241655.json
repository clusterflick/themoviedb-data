During winter, access to the village is limited to snowmobiles or, alternatively, by air using an old An-2 aircraft. Ilya Ikonnikov, the head of the Letnyaya Zolotitsa landing site, assumes multiple roles, serving as an air traffic controller, airfield watchman, cashier, loader, and stoker—all in one. He travels to the village from his hometown of Onega as part of his duty. Ikonnikov, a former journalist and poet, finds less recognition and congratulations in his aviation work than the personalized epitaphs he crafts. However, he considers the \"An-2 service\" a calling passed down from his grandfather and father.","popularity":0.3471,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winter in the Summer Zolotitsa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","original_name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c3154915794a01835559d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
