Distinguishing himself with the menacing live python that he wore around his neck as well as his legendary feuds with rival wrestlers Hulk Hogan, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, and Ultimate Warrior, Jake managed to rack up an impressive list of wrestling accomplishments before his career was sidelined by drug and alcohol abuse. The biographical documentary PICK YOUR POISON revisits The Snake's remarkable legacy with interviews, vintage promos, and 10 of his most memorable matches, including the 1988 Rude Awakening vs. DDT Match against \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude, the 1996 King of the Ring Final against Stone Cold Austin, and the 1996 Summerslam against Jerry \"The King\" Lawler.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jake 'The Snake' Roberts - Pick Your Poison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
