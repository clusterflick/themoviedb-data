The resulting notoriety and fame was too much for the Latino bad-boy genius who retreated to the darker corners of New York City.","popularity":2.4536,"poster_path":"/rn1jbfASOd9cndsUr5Tt25jHsVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burnside Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lower East Side Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2150,"logo_path":null,"name":"GreeneStreet Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piñero","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pinero","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Bratt","original_name":"Benjamin Bratt","popularity":2.826,"profile_path":"/hBenHPT4iJEG2kt5z2TOGnkRZwh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Miguel Piñero","credit_id":"52fe48cfc3a36847f817aa09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giancarlo Esposito","original_name":"Giancarlo Esposito","popularity":3.7068,"profile_path":"/rcXnr82TwDzU4ZGdBeNXfG0ZQnZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miguel Algarin","credit_id":"52fe48cfc3a36847f817aa0d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Talisa Soto","original_name":"Talisa Soto","popularity":0.5215,"profile_path":"/tpEGbGgASne8m1iHzncuxdSLIkX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sugar","credit_id":"52fe48cfc3a36847f817aa11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Vasquez","original_name":"Nelson Vasquez","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/eu42g5XCAgO7LOHxDBRd7U2zjJj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tito Goya","credit_id":"52fe48cfc3a36847f817aa15","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panchito Gómez","original_name":"Panchito Gómez","popularity":0.3023,"profile_path":"/nOPP5x1OzH16mZDbkSCOyeGg5qm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Acting Inmate","credit_id":"619cd4ce71458f002aa8ebd9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wright","original_name":"Michael Wright","popularity":0.6705,"profile_path":"/5aS8v1BcVyXSeEl4sY2Hij5Rv5i.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Edgar Bowser","credit_id":"664603c454cf1cbc7feed217","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Irby","original_name":"Michael Irby","popularity":0.7389,"profile_path":"/9cX8pKujyAlOyqGSAgvKNdA3qRj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Reinaldo Povod","credit_id":"664603d082e0c772262f0204","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Moreno","original_name":"Rita Moreno","popularity":0.7988,"profile_path":"/zB0M77jr7tmsmWHEr2bWO2Xq66L.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Miguel's Mother","credit_id":"664603fe76712d9af3bd6e4f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Sánchez","original_name":"Jaime Sánchez","popularity":0.2958,"profile_path":"/jqqdVlOGVNokKXz6NTrlM7cuOOr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Miguel's Father","credit_id":"6646040e184f8262732473fa","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rome Neal","original_name":"Rome Neal","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"6646041c0246f6c18382d08f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy Patinkin","original_name":"Mandy Patinkin","popularity":1.5368,"profile_path":"/1PeZ6roZvkcoyZZbvoSIWTgGe3a.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Joseph Papp","credit_id":"66460429f6a9c96dae3d5d08","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar A.
