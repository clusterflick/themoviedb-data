In time Funda and Aysun became mentally ill, and it fell to Elif to care for them, but eventually the burden became more than Elif and her husband could bear, and they deserted the siblings, leaving them to an unknown fate. Living in a country with no social safety net, Funda and Aysun fall prey to violence and exploitation, and their reunion with Elif and Yasemin is both poignant and troubling. Yasam Arsizi (aka Sidewalk Sisters) was an official selection at the 2008 Istanbul Film Festival.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/gcbJrdzf0HJSRJ3N5j6ZLhIZyoh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sidewalk Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Yasam Arsizi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasemin Alkaya","original_name":"Yasemin Alkaya","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/euL8QgW81biVYidbOe0MHRdgR8b.jpg","cast_id":1000,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe48d0c3a36847f817add7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elif Çağlayan","original_name":"Elif Çağlayan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe48d0c3a36847f817addb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Funda Çağlayan","original_name":"Funda Çağlayan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"6739e0b4ad278a8963f86ff5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aysun Çağlayan","original_name":"Aysun Çağlayan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"","credit_id":"6739e0bb443543191ccbe6b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berivan Umut","original_name":"Berivan Umut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"","credit_id":"6739e0d29c16dafa06f9cef7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasemin Alkaya","original_name":"Yasemin Alkaya","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/euL8QgW81biVYidbOe0MHRdgR8b.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48d0c3a36847f817ade1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1386014","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tT1EI0sSUogPHPrS1Gj3Ef0pstX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/gcbJrdzf0HJSRJ3N5j6ZLhIZyoh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
