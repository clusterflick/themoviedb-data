The game creates an alternate universe, where players challenge each other with a mythically-charged online world of humans, orcs, the undead, knights, and elves. In Beyond the Game, we meet - in real life and within the game - two of the game's leading figures, known as Grubby and Sky. Acclaimed filmmaker Jos de Putter tracks these Kasparovs of a new generation and a new game across the world all the way to the world championships in Seattle. A fascinating, surprising, and genuinely touching portrait, Beyond the Game is a study of, and participation in, the reformation of our communities in the internet age.","popularity":0.1916,"poster_path":"/jhvISiGL0bgtvzG28XpNwlmDcAR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Game","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fredrik Johansson","original_name":"Fredrik Johansson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48e4c3a36847f817f07b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Schenkhuizen","original_name":"Manuel Schenkhuizen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48e4c3a36847f817f07f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoan Merlo","original_name":"Yoan Merlo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48e4c3a36847f817f087","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3667342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Xiaofeng","original_name":"李晓峰","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/m1YeMVywOW3w935vwNlKf1RsnYx.jpg","cast_id":1020,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6584f48243cd54546c3bf7de","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":760,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sander Vos","original_name":"Sander Vos","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e4c3a36847f817f073","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223315,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wink de Putter","original_name":"Wink de Putter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e4c3a36847f817f05b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul M. van Brugge","original_name":"Paul M. van Brugge","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/nPtwxpAODX2RuWKaI1jLUQtNwul.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48e4c3a36847f817f08d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223317,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladas Naudžius","original_name":"Vladas Naudžius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54edaeef9251417961003c02","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223318,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Van Oosterhout","original_name":"Richard Van Oosterhout","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54eda924c3a36869e50013e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223319,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacko van 't Hof","original_name":"Jacko van 't Hof","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54edaefd9251417971003b8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jos de Putter","original_name":"Jos de Putter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f988421621b0091129b77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jos de Putter","original_name":"Jos de Putter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f987fca4f6700821192e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1520268","wikidata_id":"Q2338572","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1526,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jhvISiGL0bgtvzG28XpNwlmDcAR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beyond the Game Official Trailer","key":"BKqgHaT9Xd8","published_at":"2009-02-17T11:25:53.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6b2c3a3685448005e51"}]}}}
