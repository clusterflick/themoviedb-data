Imagine dreading the touch of another human but longing for a passionate encounter with a large public structure. This is the strange world of the \"objectum sexual\"– a group of people, mainly women, whose intimate lives revolve around objects with which they say they share romantic and sexual love. Erika is married to the Eiffel Tower. She has a passion for inanimate objects, and her mission is to fight the stigma surrounding the disorder and create a global network of sufferers - like Amy, in love with a church organ, and Eija Riita, who married the Berlin Wall.","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":"/xISPO3G0zkpkHAg4zyoynxqle57.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Imagine a world in which people are hostile and objects affectionate and loving","title":"Married to the Eiffel Tower","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermione Norris","original_name":"Hermione Norris","popularity":0.2879,"profile_path":"/jM67afr5YJn93RMDlexthlZwTKA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5c7d8cd29251415147481bca","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","original_name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55fffebbc3a3681a4000296a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","original_name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7d8d03c3a3684a9519253e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","original_name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7d8d0dc3a36843ed18da6a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887343,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laurence Williamson","original_name":"Laurence Williamson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7d8d22c3a36843ed18da96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rod Anderson","original_name":"Rod Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7d8d520e0a2632130f5a23","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1671539","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xISPO3G0zkpkHAg4zyoynxqle57.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
