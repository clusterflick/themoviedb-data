The dead man's detailed notes reveal that he actually committed suicide through self-imposed starvation only the summer before. Liechti's film is a stunning rapprochement of a fictional text, which itself is based upon a true event: a cinematic manifesto for life, challenged by the main character's radical renunciation of life itself.","popularity":0.309,"poster_path":"/jEzbSeVlQU5KmMTSCj0PwUkaSKJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Liechti
