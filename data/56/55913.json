'Boy' is forced to come to terms with the fact that 'Girl' no longer wants him around. The only problem is he just can't seem to leave their once shared apartment. 'Girl' decides to keep living her life around him; while he remains, watching at a distance. In time, each decides to go in his or her own distinctly different directions. 'Boy' soon finds that sometimes the greatest distance we are asked to travel is one within ourselves.","popularity":0.7517,"poster_path":"/9cWqtlN56Avz7TsZpMfZP9Illlp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Boys Don't Leave","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Eisenberg","original_name":"Jesse Eisenberg","popularity":2.4278,"profile_path":"/yYhwWRcxDHTn63gSEF1vnDAD7cD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Boy","credit_id":"52fe48e5c3a36847f817f3a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eloise Mumford","original_name":"Eloise Mumford","popularity":0.5901,"profile_path":"/qSZvYfSDO6hyecInknWpcyrQ7Hz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"52fe48e5c3a36847f817f3a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":170829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Rau","original_name":"Jennifer Rau","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/x7f6rrp1nP6rEpwUIRe0r3FTzHq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Phone Friend","credit_id":"52fe48e5c3a36847f817f3ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Stone","original_name":"Keith Stone","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Braugh","credit_id":"52fe48e5c3a36847f817f3b1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maggie Kiley","original_name":"Maggie Kiley","popularity":0.2375,"profile_path":"/afVV0N8INwL75CVTGeJj4jNaiwQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48e5c3a36847f817f395","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054731,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Mullen","original_name":"Matthew Mullen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e5c3a36847f817f3a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maggie Kiley","original_name":"Maggie Kiley","popularity":0.2375,"profile_path":"/afVV0N8INwL75CVTGeJj4jNaiwQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48e5c3a36847f817f39b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1513204","wikidata_id":"Q15270846","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kl2ZH0Wg6Wt3vjZOEWReWXUkFSP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9cWqtlN56Avz7TsZpMfZP9Illlp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
