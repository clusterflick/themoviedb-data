He's a big disappointment to his father, but mom is proud of Goliath II anyway. Goliath II is constantly getting into trouble because he's so small. In particular, the tiger Raja looks for every opportunity to try a bite-size taste of elephant. After one incident where he ran away and his mother scolded him, he runs away. After he's rescued, the rest of the elephants are terrified of a mouse, but Goliath II stands his ground.","popularity":1.0381,"poster_path":"/10SnRCGYANzX3QeY9fSEPIc1p2i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goliath II","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sterling Holloway","original_name":"Sterling Holloway","popularity":0.613,"profile_path":"/86gGSpQcfgQrumwwvOmO6DtTWkP.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe48d5c3a36847f817babd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Raja the Tiger","credit_id":"52fe48d5c3a36847f817bac1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
