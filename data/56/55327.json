He achieved his greatest fame as Moebius - not so much a pseudonym as an alter ego. With his triple-split personality - Jean Giraud, Moebius, Gir - he succeeded in making his work accessible in popular comic strip series like Blueberry, in metaphysical fantasies like John Difool and, not least, to a broad public, with set designs for films such as The Fifth Element. In Moebius Redux - A Life in Pictures an exceptional artist tells his life's and work's story. Extraordinary views on Paris, Los Angeles and the Mexican desert build a visual link between his life and his artistic universe, accompanied by the electronic soundtrack composed by \"Kraftwerk\" legend Karl Bartos.","popularity":0.6045,"poster_path":"/gnVtpbTsT7LScTuVPyP22HDhjP9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":33137,"logo_path":"/48FTUmbd9izGa98zHJWfP0PZXVk.png","name":"Morag Loves Company","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":17255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avanti Media Plus","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moebius Redux: A Life in Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Moebius - ett fantastiskt liv","type":"Swedish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Moebius - fantastinen elämä","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Moebius Redux - Ein Leben in Bildern","type":"copyright title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"In Search of Moebius","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5045,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan O'Bannon","original_name":"Dan O'Bannon","popularity":0.4136,"profile_path":"/k52NrI4p37oboVIMqxLA05Qr4rl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54becf0cc3a3684046008d6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44070,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Enki Bilal","original_name":"Enki Bilal","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/s3aCmBRnonAe54ewReghmGPuqht.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5686ee22c3a36860e9020570","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Druillet","original_name":"Philippe Druillet","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/vQL55EDiIyPZPs4xO4jNujvtCN1.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5686ee2b9251417e6300806a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.
