But when they are \"adopted\" by a clever yet lovable stray Golden Retriever, their lives change in ways they never imagined. It's not long before the Lowrys discover that Pilot is pregnant. But when it comes time to find new homes for the puppies, the Lowrys learn how hard it can be to say goodbye and how a determined Golden Retriever can show them a thing or two about the bonds of family. Pilot wants her puppies back! Can the Lowrys retrieve the Retrievers from the wacky cast of characters that adopted them? The Retrievers is a heartwarming story about how a stray Golden Retriever, along with her litter of pups, teaches the Lowrys some big lessons about life, love, family, and what's truly important.","popularity":2.8815,"poster_path":"/wbk02KFWuZd1pPZm3ligMwDMZIY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tag Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":100419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jungled Digital Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes it takes man's best friend to show what it really means to be a family.","title":"The Retrievers","video":false,"vote_average":5.036,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Petits chiots pour grande famille","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"4 Pfoten Hotel","type":"DVD title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das 4 Pfoten Hotel","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Amigos de Ouro","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Kutyafalka","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Pilot's Puppies","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Un retriever... y seis más","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Hays","original_name":"Robert Hays","popularity":0.9095,"profile_path":"/qbfxPYo5eAsO8LGkOPei4o4SH92.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tom Lowry","credit_id":"52fe48c0c3a36847f81777e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Harris","original_name":"Mel Harris","popularity":0.5885,"profile_path":"/hKQ09Iku4IwfSD6D8jTmvm8ptMq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karen Lowry","credit_id":"52fe48c0c3a36847f81777e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Rachins","original_name":"Alan Rachins","popularity":0.5811,"profile_path":"/1akJ7gu8jZNDQ5vZWsgZcckl2aw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ed","credit_id":"52fe48c0c3a36847f81777e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alana Austin","original_name":"Alana Austin","popularity":0.3931,"profile_path":"/cNqn4YdP2bMvTkZ9jOft82KPuiS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Liz Lowry","credit_id":"52fe48c0c3a36847f81777ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Emerson","original_name":"Taylor Emerson","popularity":0.2859,"profile_path":"/6qy5TIRUEZYalJVioNmKxde0802.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Widdy Lowry","credit_id":"52fe48c0c3a36847f81777f1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty White","original_name":"Betty White","popularity":0.9147,"profile_path":"/eYDjR4ajOkzYDyEIMzOoSJz8za2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Krisper","credit_id":"52fe48c0c3a36847f81777f5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Wagner","original_name":"Robert Wagner","popularity":1.7516,"profile_path":"/dgIN3MrOfX8Q4pzchO58dhMgrFb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Durham Haysworth","credit_id":"52fe48c0c3a36847f81777f9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Johnson","original_name":"Kurt Johnson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Marcel","credit_id":"5f35e3ecc4f5520034096644","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1418199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cathy Fithian","original_name":"Cathy Fithian","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Charlene Groper","credit_id":"5f35e3ff33ad8f0038a3886a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Tipton","original_name":"Ken Tipton","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Norman Groper","credit_id":"5f35e40e8813e40035514448","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Dennis","original_name":"Josh Dennis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Marvin Groper","credit_id":"5f35e4356bdec30033c4a3b4","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiree Yard","original_name":"Desiree Yard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Brenda Groper","credit_id":"5f35e447c4f552003409676e","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2530847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cole Stratton","original_name":"Cole Stratton","popularity":0.3582,"profile_path":"/6hLkA9fO5ibzOjbZDof5fzmPs1X.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Phil","credit_id":"5f35e46133ad8f0038a3891f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan A.
