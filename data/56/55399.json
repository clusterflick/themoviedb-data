The boys are going to buy him a box of cigars, but they're broke. They do a quick bout of yardwork and hit Donald up for the price of the cigars (without telling him why), but he makes them put it in a piggy bank. The problem: how to get the money without Donald catching them. Donald catches them buying the cigars but thinks they are buying them for themselves and forces them to smoke until they are sick the whole box.","popularity":0.4331,"poster_path":"/uS6a0CW4XdnxpqZXsRFUrz60HoC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donald's Happy Birthday","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Donalds Geburtstag","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Nash","original_name":"Clarence Nash","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/x2g2hbu4RRIcn6Q5RT8gpWR1FKV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Donald Duck / Huey / Dewey / Louie (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f81799b7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148253,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jack Boyd","original_name":"Jack Boyd","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f8179995","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Wallace","original_name":"Oliver Wallace","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f817998f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148174,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bill Justice","original_name":"Bill Justice","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f81799b3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f8179989","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Hannah","original_name":"Jack Hannah","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/kWFFTlq7VEjbRho2pWLT2zAD05Q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f8179977","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yale Gracey","original_name":"Yale Gracey","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f81799a1","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Berg","original_name":"Bill Berg","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f8179983","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick George","original_name":"Nick George","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f817997d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148175,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Volus Jones","original_name":"Volus Jones","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f81799ad","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148178,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ralph Hulett","original_name":"Ralph Hulett","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f81799a7","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148176,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bob Carlson","original_name":"Bob Carlson","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48cac3a36847f817999b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0041306","wikidata_id":"Q3388401","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":830,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eaWJREfACeVNWfqS1JV27m7x5nm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1474}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":869,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uS6a0CW4XdnxpqZXsRFUrz60HoC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":583},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uO4omQ04EwaHHEjIO85CguyU7ls.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/aZH9gcvom6Fh7Ay37Qhualy4eU7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1949-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
