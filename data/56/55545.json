Anna is a typical middle-class housewife, filling her day with good works, until one day, when she finds a note that leads to a shattering discovery - her husband has been having an affair. Anna's intense shock at finding out Keith's secret is compounded when she arranges to meet his lover. When Steve arrives at the meeting place, Anna is forced to accept the fact that Keith has been leading a double life for the length of their marriage. Steve stresses the risk of AIDS and urges Anna to have an AIDS test. To show her what it can be like to live with the disease, he introduces her to Jim, who needs 24-hour care and has developed a realistic attitude towards his own death. When Keith leaves home suddenly, Anna is forced to tell her son about the threat of HIV, but Peter turns violently against her and runs away.","popularity":1.4458,"poster_path":"/wB7wONUVpI8lU6tasOXzhEeqbLl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arden Films","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closing Numbers","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Closing Numbers - und das Leben geht weiter","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Fechando NÃºmeros","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Woodward","original_name":"Tim Woodward","popularity":0.4262,"profile_path":"/zxPCPmDkVxUI1qoeeK7lqrgdXVJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Keith","credit_id":"52fe48d2c3a36847f817b455","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Asher","original_name":"Jane Asher","popularity":0.5864,"profile_path":"/65epDhqEq8hOOQtLwXQffRuIxwn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"52fe48d2c3a36847f817b459","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Mills","original_name":"Frank Mills","popularity":0.2124,"profile_path":"/1WMbFhOR2mcbkCvgA3cgUnsSZP4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"52fe48d2c3a36847f817b45d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Douglas","original_name":"Hazel Douglas","popularity":0.2167,"profile_path":"/eIs59n6F9HH54LZr1b2aZ3UQJZW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"52fe48d2c3a36847f817b461","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Glover","original_name":"Jamie Glover","popularity":0.2794,"profile_path":"/yvw1rJqo0c5BEIUOYWk63Te5xDx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"52fe48d2c3a36847f817b465","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kris Marshall","original_name":"Kris Marshall","popularity":0.8452,"profile_path":"/gBq5B3HETUfgdK3vyXXLT7d4oXs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fredericks","credit_id":"58a09a819251412b630005c9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Flynn","original_name":"Judy Flynn","popularity":0.2231,"profile_path":"/mCOhwukFA4x5m7dR4GD2lyCfz6y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ellie","credit_id":"58a09a8d9251412b6d00059a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Whittaker","original_name":"Stephen Whittaker","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48d2c3a36847f817b46b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201866,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Cook","original_name":"David Cook","popularity":0.1771,"profile_path":"/3gs9lxz2Ghu9Neut1hRwxrEYCcM.jpg","credit_id":"58a09ae69251412b700006af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1767523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Desmond","original_name":"Sara Desmond","popularity":0.2175,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9b5bd89251417760f7c3d6","department":"Directing","job":"Third Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109448","wikidata_id":"Q32859629","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pDPu2LdFghOWxgCeZZvwTBUXfJz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w5gBgDKf1efSXARG2VLOve5HvsC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wB7wONUVpI8lU6tasOXzhEeqbLl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1326,"name":"infidelity"},{"id":740,"name":"aids"},{"id":3183,"name":"bisexuality"},{"id":9766,"name":"hiv"},{"id":10180,"name":"male homosexuality"},{"id":11524,"name":"in the closet"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
