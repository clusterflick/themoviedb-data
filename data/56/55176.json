When the doctors tell him he is fatally ill, the earth opens up beneath him and he finds himself plunging into the abyss. It makes him think of the time he was 13 and his girlfriend got him to jump off the balcony of her father's house with a sun umbrella for a parachute. Two stories separated by 29 years are told in parallel, but gradually intertwine into one drama. Both stories have moments of joy and tragedy, as fates wondrously separate and are brought back together again. It is a story about making a leap of faith, trusting in yourself and realizing that, ultimately, life is no good without humour, even of the darker variety.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":"/sIpUGMe9YQqGP7IztGJ6hoL4e0t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Leap","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234404,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arne Forchammer","original_name":"Arne Forchhammer","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":"/bExaUMM530FqA6OddvKJDHB6Nyf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48bfc3a36847f8177643","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henning Carlsen","original_name":"Henning Carlsen","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/tuDZNAEGJkwOiI6N5YALsm1yEk7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48bfc3a36847f8177637","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henning Carlsen","original_name":"Henning Carlsen","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/tuDZNAEGJkwOiI6N5YALsm1yEk7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48bfc3a36847f817763d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0420216","wikidata_id":"Q12336735","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/sIpUGMe9YQqGP7IztGJ6hoL4e0t.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
