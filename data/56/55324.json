Rochefort, the Cardinal's right-hand man, announces the official disbanding of the King's Musketeers. Three, however, refuse to throw down their swords - Athos the fighter and drinker, Porthos the pirate and lover, and Aramis the priest and poet. Arriving in Paris to join the Musketeers, D'Artagnan uncovers the Cardinal's plans, and the four set out on a mission to protect King and Country.","popularity":2.7275,"poster_path":"/3hCSeScjXByyTBXzqWdTHuAsvVA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65288,"logo_path":"/iXd0oGOIsFTL4kKz0knYT2VMuMJ.png","name":"Burbank Animation Studios","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1986-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All for one and one for all.","title":"The Three Musketeers","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivar Kants","original_name":"Ivar Kants","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/uNhgp05AzUEHHfJt5lAsKQh5osK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"D'Artagnan","credit_id":"52fe48c6c3a36847f8178d37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Ferrier","original_name":"Noel Ferrier","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/3SxEliue0YDoSn5MHmUnsB4LaVR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cardinal Richelieu","credit_id":"52fe48c6c3a36847f8178d3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":190461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Kate Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":"/ckDTcLQYGaFH2eRt5LaS69GI3lF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Milady","credit_id":"52fe48c6c3a36847f8178d3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":152485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Bursill","original_name":"Tina Bursill","popularity":0.1953,"profile_path":"/ujQARg5zH78GbDyx3BwcNzxLqRF.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"662794f72e2b2c01876a0705","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1250218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Volska","original_name":"Anna Volska","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"66279523cb6db50186b1ffa3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Hinton","original_name":"Phillip Hinton","popularity":0.2102,"profile_path":"/xt4NGtoSqsrbiKGXRmoTtDEt2eG.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"66279589258823016491eea3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Lewis","original_name":"Andrew Lewis","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"66279605cb5c8e014a3f2f24","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Robinson","original_name":"Keith Robinson","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"66279667176a94017f81f1e4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929379,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Stephenson","original_name":"George Stephenson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"662796d029c626014b49acc6","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635045,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Dewhurst","original_name":"Keith Dewhurst","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ee2eedc3a3682a2d002292","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24840,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Dumas","original_name":"Alexandre Dumas","popularity":0.6363,"profile_path":"/4SMjZU8QwvKZR8uvTWiUDHQd2rW.jpg","credit_id":"57ee2f13c3a3682aa10025ba","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586773,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Warwick Gilbert","original_name":"Warwick Gilbert","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ee2f3ec3a3684e5a003ec2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569411,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary L.
