Maria Bamford, as even casual fans will admit, is not \"most people.\" There's no telling what her Plan A might have entailed (perhaps a one-woman rendition of \"Grey Gardens?\"), but Bamford's Plan B turns out to be a virtuoso, one-woman performance of a self-imposed stint in Northwoods exile. Filmed live at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis, the extra-packed DVD now out from Stand Up! Records has an intimate and theatrical flavor that may feel unexpected to some of Bamford's followers, but skillfully weaves together the most well-wrought portions of her repertoire. More focused than her usual stand-up routine, in Plan B Bamford takes on the story of her own Hollywood life, viewed from the much safer - and possibly much weirder - climes of Duluth, MN.","popularity":0.4001,"poster_path":"/3CER74aB2ZQwQvEPNK2LoOeIC2x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria Bamford: Plan B","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bamford","original_name":"Maria Bamford","popularity":0.5142,"profile_path":"/u1ARSLAKGuTwUsZysUQmRc3mUMG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe48e1c3a36847f817e62b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Moe","original_name":"David Moe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7111981d78f20034674f43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bamford","original_name":"Maria Bamford","popularity":0.5142,"profile_path":"/u1ARSLAKGuTwUsZysUQmRc3mUMG.jpg","credit_id":"5f711177fbe36f00386374ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7407662","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3CER74aB2ZQwQvEPNK2LoOeIC2x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
