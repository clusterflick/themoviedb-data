In order to stop Vlad's doomsday plan for world domination, Vampirella must make a dangerous alliance with a group of hi-tech vampire hunters.  It's a race to stop the apocalypse of humanity and our fate is in the hands of the fiery, dangerous and beautiful Vampirella.","popularity":2.3389,"poster_path":"/k2NGVYgXXSK1IbXDQIvMOMWgWBK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunset Films International","origin_country":""},{"id":4688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concorde-New Horizons","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4343,"logo_path":"/rXq1B1Hnkdnw6soz1zoGcslK3wb.png","name":"Showtime Networks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thirsty for Justice, She'll Settle for Blood.","title":"Vampirella","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":54,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ヴァンピレラ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Talisa Soto","original_name":"Talisa Soto","popularity":0.5215,"profile_path":"/tpEGbGgASne8m1iHzncuxdSLIkX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vampirella","credit_id":"52fe48e7c3a36847f817fbf7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Daltrey","original_name":"Roger Daltrey","popularity":0.7913,"profile_path":"/wQUIoUytxAoqaMpq2jW51v4CLhJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vlad / Jamie Blood","credit_id":"52fe48e7c3a36847f817fbfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Joseph Paul","original_name":"Richard Joseph Paul","popularity":0.2832,"profile_path":"/yOtssoW3MkVSPC3gaPYcdDmmxB0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Adam Van Helsing","credit_id":"52fe48e7c3a36847f817fbff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bloom","original_name":"Brian Bloom","popularity":0.9474,"profile_path":"/9mZKhI3aVbzZ5Xq43n7fGzWAqi0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Demos","credit_id":"52fe48e7c3a36847f817fc09","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1017324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinna Harney","original_name":"Corinna Harney","popularity":0.2409,"profile_path":"/m05S4DxC7G6WC3tk8OtHqdH1o7O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sallah","credit_id":"52fe48e7c3a36847f817fc0d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rusty Meyers","original_name":"Rusty Meyers","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/6lGZUnMlo5jC2XjF8pbxOFyBLoH.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Quinn","credit_id":"55dc0eef925141699e0014ca","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee de Broux","original_name":"Lee de Broux","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/9u5KPjQlpBpfiLctkX3gD0uADxX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lt.
