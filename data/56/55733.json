While there, he meets and falls in love with a spirited, lovely young woman, Meriam (Nichols), without realizing she is really a member of the Bahraini Royal Family. Meriam, who does not wish to consent to an arranged marriage, knows her love affair with Jason is dangerous, as he is a Mormon Christian and she a Muslim. Her parents would never consent to their match, and so Meriam and Jason race against time to escape Bahrain and make it to the United States, where they can marry. If Meriam is sent back, however, her life may be in jeopardy.","popularity":2.7118,"poster_path":"/rDzQcIUJDE75RkehI1AF72fRPL3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Princess & the Marine","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La Princesa y el Marine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark-Paul Gosselaar","original_name":"Mark-Paul Gosselaar","popularity":1.0771,"profile_path":"/6TbZu1RXaBu3gvwoPlNWBqFoqxw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jason Johnson","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a36847f817d8d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisol Nichols","original_name":"Marisol Nichols","popularity":0.7273,"profile_path":"/9vSFX3NqyjhKLT6EBVwuzrt9eDS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Meriam Al-Khalifa","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a36847f817d8d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith D.
