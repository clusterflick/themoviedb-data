He left behind a warning to the town: \"If you ever have another Halloween again, I will return and destroy you all!\" Curtis was buried in a locked crypt, along with a sculpture so evil, that unearthly fates were said to await anyone who looked at it. Now, 20 years later, the Walker men have returned to Walker Falls. They start a chain of events that unleashes an army of zombies on the town. Has Curtis Danko risen from the grave to exact his revenge? And will the people of Walker Falls make it through the night?","popularity":1.1149,"poster_path":"/2SKXCsd4a44CO9ZQU6hNt1Kk18c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1556,"logo_path":"/31h94rG9hzjprXoYNy3L1ErUya2.png","name":"20th Century Fox Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fox Television Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":70694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moonwatcher Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":84441,"logo_path":null,"name":"parachute entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rest in peace","title":"When Good Ghouls Go Bad","video":false,"vote_average":5.74,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Привидение за работой","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Lloyd","original_name":"Christopher Lloyd","popularity":2.5212,"profile_path":"/nxVjpyb3UrfbPZnEyDNlQVlFAs5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Uncle Fred Walker","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178deb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Pichler","original_name":"Joe Pichler","popularity":0.2597,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Danny Walker","credit_id":"621f41a477b1fb001e180785","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Amandes","original_name":"Tom Amandes","popularity":0.7639,"profile_path":"/aDvaQEPNWKjjyVWG0zl3ZwEWirf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"James Walker","credit_id":"575d7e22c3a36831a4004373","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Billing","original_name":"Roy Billing","popularity":0.4264,"profile_path":"/aG6gpPbgG2pp9usJgQRRMFUV3BB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mayor Churney","credit_id":"575d7e339251410423000051","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":210276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Byrnes","original_name":"Brittany Byrnes","popularity":0.1716,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dayna","credit_id":"575d7e4b92514103e800004a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":212050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imelda Corcoran","original_name":"Imelda Corcoran","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/qUKhamo0T8BrDM3BzCOYqjHJb42.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Taylor","credit_id":"575d7f1c9251412443002756","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":207938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhonda Doyle","original_name":"Rhonda Doyle","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/e8Po6Mn9iRJqrsjl8yASL0KEoPV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Churney","credit_id":"575d7f629251412443002764","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan McCarthy","original_name":"Brendan McCarthy","popularity":0.1691,"profile_path":"/8wBmacIQkkGZYri0UBSgs27FfmG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Curtis Danko","credit_id":"575d7fbec3a36879bb0007fe","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1634530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Borgonon","original_name":"Colin Borgonon","popularity":0.2287,"profile_path":"/tFIj4LxPMDL69ZNoBJlLFycfjH1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herr Schtein","credit_id":"575d7fde9251412443002788","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1634526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayley Sullivan","original_name":"Hayley Sullivan","popularity":0.1798,"profile_path":"/uedEvspWUpcANzNEaVk7oJDsRSd.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Danny's friend in car (uncredited)","credit_id":"575d7ff7c3a3681351002ca2","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Read Johnson","original_name":"Patrick Read Johnson","popularity":0.2587,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575d823e925141540300099f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Gordon","original_name":"Christopher Gordon","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":"/ramsTZ4CopkelnzVQDMGzVM9OUQ.jpg","credit_id":"6410d105c390c500a467e452","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":358070,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Lau","original_name":"John Lau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642d5463158c8500e0b7dd4f","department":"Writing","job":"Teleplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9583,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Charlie Revai","original_name":"Charlie Revai","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642d54f854a8ac0ac23d2fb9","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"R.L.
