America, a nation with no memory at all.\" In Liberia, the summer of 2003 was pure insanity. A rebel army attempts to overthrow a government run by an indicted war criminal. Two armies engage in the final battle of a decade long civil war. Hundreds of innocent civilians die from mortar shells launched from afar and thousands more suffer hunger while the soldiers, mostly teenagers, keep the capital city under siege. The nation prays that America, the world's sole superpower, will put an end to the violence. Conceived in Washington in the early 1800s, its constitution written at Harvard, its founding fathers freed slaves who returned to Africa, Liberia is the one country in the world worthy of the title, Made in America. By the year 2000, Liberia, once considered the gem of Africa, was ranked last in the world for quality of life.","popularity":0.0776,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liberia: An Uncivil War","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136326,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Brabazon","original_name":"James Brabazon","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee4854ea217c0001fd0836f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Stack","original_name":"Jonathan Stack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee48543a217c00022d0fa45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0433409","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
