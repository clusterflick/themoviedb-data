She was able to snare him into a relationship in which they got to know each other better and Donald got to meet Daisy's family. Finally, Donald decides to marry Daisy but when waiting for her to arrive so he can pop the question, he falls asleep and has a nightmarish vision of what married life would be like (among other things that he'll be forced to do all the housework and be served a burnt T bone for dinner). Needless to say, the marriage is called off when he awakens.","popularity":0.4868,"poster_path":"/zRUeH40ya9HZ0sNV3m0QfGq3YzE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donald's Diary","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il diario di Paperino","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"唐纳德的日记","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Nash","original_name":"Clarence Nash","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/x2g2hbu4RRIcn6Q5RT8gpWR1FKV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Donald Duck / Huey / Dewey / Louie (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f81791d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Denison","original_name":"Leslie Denison","popularity":0.1334,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Donald's Internal Monologue / Narrator (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f81791df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivi Janiss","original_name":"Vivi Janiss","popularity":0.1819,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Daisy Duck / Daisy's Mother (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e9062284a4bf60fa250e42c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":198369,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ken O'Brien","original_name":"Ken O'Brien","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f81791a5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Kinney","original_name":"Jack Kinney","popularity":0.3626,"profile_path":"/4wFzg3PdcrB1wPnCl5sj4KuS2Mk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f8179193","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149976,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"John Sibley","original_name":"John Sibley","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f8179199","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Kinney","original_name":"Dick Kinney","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f81791bd","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150040,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Brice Mack","original_name":"Brice Mack","popularity":0.1097,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f81791b7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148244,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dan MacManus","original_name":"Dan MacManus","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f81791b1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150051,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Harry Holt","original_name":"Harry Holt","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f817919f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Bushman","original_name":"Bruce Bushman","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c8c3a36847f81791c3","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148823,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Edwin Aardal","original_name":"Edwin Aardal","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ee26cc9251413e3201693d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31021,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward H.
