It was shot entirely on a (then-new) Fisher Price PixelVision PXL2000 low-fidelity camcorder in monochrome on compact audio cassette, inspiring Richard Linklater to utilize the same technique in his 1991 feature SLACKER. The film recontextualizes Citizen Kane to provide some self-reflexive commentary on the filmmaker's status in the world.","popularity":0.0866,"poster_path":"/fDc0cC8GZG820GkNb75hx4AC5ZN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Yuppie","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Ebert","original_name":"Roger Ebert","popularity":0.2634,"profile_path":"/v6u4y55SC9Z0vaC0NmU4MRkRBB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Citizen Yuppie","credit_id":"6169c5813a9937002c9e176e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Ebert","original_name":"Roger Ebert","popularity":0.2634,"profile_path":"/v6u4y55SC9Z0vaC0NmU4MRkRBB.jpg","credit_id":"6169c5958fdda90042564e6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Ebert","original_name":"Roger Ebert","popularity":0.2634,"profile_path":"/v6u4y55SC9Z0vaC0NmU4MRkRBB.jpg","credit_id":"6169c5a13a9937008e48a1f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.3,"height":2230,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zv7FTgum5untOSLDeTNPwILie5f.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2900},{"aspect_ratio":1.277,"height":2206,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ye0kmvtQ3MrBQw0wAyVyp7wDXq.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2818},{"aspect_ratio":1.412,"height":2644,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZqyBz82WDoFXTvLK6PZ2Vqv2VL.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3734}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fDc0cC8GZG820GkNb75hx4AC5ZN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
