They allow us to empathize through feeling, not thinking. Their discovery confirms our evolutionary path to see others as similar to ourselves. This work celebrates our biology through a series of musically-driven gestures intended to activate our neural networks. It also considers the external factors impeding our ability to harmonize.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/xn2USBBuNAQ6hjveItutkgdmB9M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mirror Neuron","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Becker","original_name":"Tommy Becker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616c10e76728a80043d0d106","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xn2USBBuNAQ6hjveItutkgdmB9M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2021-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
