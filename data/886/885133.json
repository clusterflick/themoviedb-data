I created a live event in the television studio using an urban classroom of children and my films and videos. The sound was the childrenâ€™s spontaneous songs mixed with the repeated countdown of a rocket launching; the conversation between the astronauts and Mission Control and U.S. troops engaged in battle in the Vietnam War. This tape is shown as a non-scripted improvisation. The studio environment and the children were bombarded by media.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/uNTGNACVs2UegVoEqdNQvDgGfUL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minus 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aldo Tambellini","original_name":"Aldo Tambellini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616918baec1879002c0c376c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uNTGNACVs2UegVoEqdNQvDgGfUL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
